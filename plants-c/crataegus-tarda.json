    "intro": "Crataegus tarda, commonly known as late hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated edges, and turn yellow in the fall. Crataegus tarda thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
