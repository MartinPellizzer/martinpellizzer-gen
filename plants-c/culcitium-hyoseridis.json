    "intro": "Culcitium hyoseridis, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are palmately lobed and adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
