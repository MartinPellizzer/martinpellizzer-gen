    "intro": "Cousinia annua, commonly known as the annual cushion flower, is a flowering plant native to the cold, arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing cushions of foliage and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers. Cousinia annua is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in full sun."
