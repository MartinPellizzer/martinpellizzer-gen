    "intro": "Calea tejadae, commonly known as the Mexican ghostflower, is a unique flowering plant native to the highlands of central Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, hooded flowers that resemble ghostly faces, which are a key feature in its common name. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its showy, short-lived blooms. Calea tejadae thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its botanical significance lies in its distinctive morphology and its role in traditional Mexican medicine."
