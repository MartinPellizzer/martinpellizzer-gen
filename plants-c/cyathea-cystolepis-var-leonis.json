    "intro": "Cyathea cystolepis var. leonis, commonly known as the golden tree fern, is a tropical evergreen fern belonging to the family Dicksoniaceae. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. Its trunk is covered in a fibrous, spongy material that resembles bark, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively hardy in tropical and subtropical climates."
