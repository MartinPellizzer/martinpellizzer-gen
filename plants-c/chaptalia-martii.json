    "intro": "Chaptalia martii, commonly known as the Andean mountain daisy, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Chaptalia martii is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
