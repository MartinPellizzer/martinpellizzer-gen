    "intro": "Cyrtacanthus, commonly known as the \"Coral Bean\" or \"Coral Tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bignoniaceae. These plants are native to the Americas, particularly Central and South America, and are characterized by their striking, colorful flowers that resemble coral. Cyrtacanthus species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, featuring palmate leaves and showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like hummingbirds. The genus includes several species, such as Cyrtacanthus tetragonus, which is known for its vibrant red and orange blooms. These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are relatively drought-tolerant once established."
