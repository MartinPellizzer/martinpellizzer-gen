    "intro": "Chasmanthium laxum var. sessiliflorum, commonly known as the flatflower switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It features slender, arching stems that produce small, pale green to golden yellow florets, which are sessile, meaning they lack a stalk. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along streambanks. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that adds ornamental value. It is valued for its ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for wildlife, and its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
