    "intro": "Calonemorchis filifera, commonly known as the threadleaf calonemorchis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle beauty to its habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
