    "intro": "Cousinia praestans, commonly known as the showy globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and clusters of showy, yellow-to-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the upper leaves are smaller and more narrow. Cousinia praestans thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its striking appearance and adaptability to harsh environments contribute to its botanical interest."
