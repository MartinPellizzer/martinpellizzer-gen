    "intro": "Centrolepis kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu centrolepis, is a unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. This plant is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its mountainous habitat, often growing in rocky or mossy areas. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated, a common trait among sedges. Due to its restricted distribution and ecological specificity, Centrolepis kinabaluensis is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
