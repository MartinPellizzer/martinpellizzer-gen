    "intro": "Carex tolmiei var. leptosaccus, commonly known as the narrow-sheath sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges, and its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like structures. It produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled, spikelet-like fruits. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in wetland environments."
