    "intro": "Coilosperma cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf sedge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in moist environments such as swamps and riverbanks. Its leaves are linear and often have a distinct heart-shaped base, giving it its common name. Coilosperma cordata produces small, clustered flowers that are usually green or brown, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
