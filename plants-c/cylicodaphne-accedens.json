It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and long, pinnately compound leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The leaves are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white powder, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight. This ornamental plant is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and as a houseplant."
