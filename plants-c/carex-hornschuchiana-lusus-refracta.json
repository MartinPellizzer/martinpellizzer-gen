    "intro": "Carex hornschuchiana lusus refracta, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Europe. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green, with a slightly rough texture. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated, a common trait among sedges. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds and streams."
