    "intro": "Capparis zizyphoides, commonly known as the sour fig or Indian sour fig, is a flowering plant native to regions of southern and eastern Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its thorny stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are sour and somewhat acidic in taste. The botanical features of Capparis zizyphoides make it well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, often found in dry, rocky soils."
