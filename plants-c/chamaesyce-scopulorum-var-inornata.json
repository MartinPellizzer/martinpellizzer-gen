    "intro": "Chamaesyce scopulorum var. inornata, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle ornamental touch to rocky landscapes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, enabling it to survive in dry, rocky habitats."
