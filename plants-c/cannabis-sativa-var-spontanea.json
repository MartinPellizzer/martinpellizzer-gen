It typically grows in wild or semi-wild environments and is characterized by its tall, slender stature and loosely branched structure. This variety is often found in regions with temperate climates and is adapted to thrive in open, sunny conditions. Its leaves are usually narrower and less dense compared to cultivated cannabis strains.
