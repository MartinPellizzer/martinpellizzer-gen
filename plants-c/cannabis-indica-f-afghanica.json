    "intro": "Cannabis indica f. afghanica, commonly known as Afghan hemp, is a subspecies of Cannabis indica native to the mountainous regions of Afghanistan. It is characterized by its dense, broad leaves and relatively short stature compared to other cannabis varieties. This plant typically flowers in late summer and produces small, spherical buds that are rich in cannabinoids such as THC and CBD. It thrives in cool, arid climates and is often cultivated for its medicinal and psychoactive properties. Due to its genetic distinctiveness, it holds significant importance in botanical and pharmacological research."
