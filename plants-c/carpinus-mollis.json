    "intro": "Carpinus mollis, commonly known as the silky buckeye, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in spring, followed by spiny, spherical fruits that contain one or two seeds. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Carpinus mollis prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
