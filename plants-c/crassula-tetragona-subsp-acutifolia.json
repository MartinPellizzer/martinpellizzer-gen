    "intro": "Crassula tetragona subsp. acutifolia, commonly known as the sharpleaf crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features dense, compact growth with fleshy, triangular leaves that are sharply pointed, giving it its common name. The leaves are typically a deep green color and can develop a reddish tinge when exposed to full sun. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. This species is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
