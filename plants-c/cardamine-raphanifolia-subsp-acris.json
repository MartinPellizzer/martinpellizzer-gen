    "intro": "Cardamine raphanifolia subsp. acris, commonly known as the slender watercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. This subspecies is native to parts of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
