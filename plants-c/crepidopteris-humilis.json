    "intro": "Crepidopteris humilis, commonly known as the spider fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a pale underside. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
