It is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white petals and a distinctive, pouch-like lip that serves as a pollination chamber. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a striking visual element to its natural habitat. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
