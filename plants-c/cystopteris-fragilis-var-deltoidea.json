    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis var. deltoidea, commonly known as the deltoid maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to the eastern United States, particularly in moist, shaded habitats. The fronds are typically bright green and have a distinctive, feathery appearance with a fragile, almost papery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a key feature of fern reproduction. It thrives in humid environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil."
