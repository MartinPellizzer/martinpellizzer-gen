    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum rubroguttatum, commonly known as the red-spotted orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant orange flowers with distinctive red spots, which are particularly prominent on the petals and sepals. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique floral structure and vivid coloration make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
