    "intro": "Crataegus cibaria, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits called haws, which are edible but often used in jams and wines. Crataegus cibaria is also valued for its ecological role, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
