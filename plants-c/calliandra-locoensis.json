    "intro": "Calliandra locoensis, commonly known as the Locoensis calliandra, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, feathery inflorescences. The plant produces small, colorful flowers that range from pink to red, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, and it has a woody stem with thorn-like structures. Calliandra locoensis is often used in ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates."
