    "intro": "Calligonum \u00d7 erinaceum, commonly known as the horned flax, is a hybrid shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, club-shaped stems that resemble horns, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Calligonum \u00d7 erinaceum is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
