    "intro": "Ceropegia spaniflora, commonly known as the African violet or the string of hearts, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, trailing stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which are adapted for pollination by specific insects. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its compact growth habit and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
