    "intro": "Cochemiea setispina, commonly known as the stiff-spined cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a low-growing, globular cactus with a dense covering of spines that provide protection against herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. Its fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Cochemiea setispina is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and minimal water requirements."
