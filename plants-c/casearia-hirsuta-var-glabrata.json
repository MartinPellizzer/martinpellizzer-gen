    "intro": "Casearia hirsuta var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth casearia, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often hairy leaves, though the varietal form glabrata has smoother foliage. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
