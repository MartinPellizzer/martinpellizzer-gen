    "intro": "Crudia venenosa, commonly known as the poison bush, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant contains toxic compounds, particularly in its leaves and stems, which can cause severe irritation or poisoning if ingested. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided in horticulture and requires caution when handling."
