    "intro": "Coburgia recurvata, commonly known as the rock fig, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapting well to arid and saline conditions. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are often consumed by local wildlife and humans. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Coburgia recurvata is valued for its resilience and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental appeal."
