    "intro": "Cathastrum, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae. These plants are native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in Mexico and the southwestern United States. They are characterized by their spiny stems and clusters of vibrant, often yellow or red, flowers. Cathastrum species are typically succulent, storing water in their thick, fleshy stems to survive in dry environments. They are popular in horticulture for their unique appearance and ability to thrive in low-water conditions."
