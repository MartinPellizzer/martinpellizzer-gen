    "intro": "Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus subsp. typicus, commonly known as sticky goldenbush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that give it a sticky texture, particularly on its leaves and stems. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland desert regions. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to arid environments and a valuable plant for ecological restoration."
