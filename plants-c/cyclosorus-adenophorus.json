    "intro": "Cyclosorus adenophorus, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Cyclosorus adenophorus is known for its ability to trap small aquatic organisms, which it uses as a source of nutrients."
