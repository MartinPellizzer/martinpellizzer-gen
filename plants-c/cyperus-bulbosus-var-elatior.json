    "intro": "Cyperus bulbosus var. elatior, commonly known as the tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It features grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy, with a robust root system adapted for waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to greenish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistent moisture. Cyperus bulbosus var. elatior is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
