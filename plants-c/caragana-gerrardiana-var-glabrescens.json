    "intro": "Caragana gerrardiana var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth caragana, is a shrub native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and small, compound leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees. Its hardy nature allows it to thrive in poor soils and harsh climates, making it a common species in steppe and desert environments. The variety glabrescens is distinguished by its smoother, less hairy foliage compared to other varieties of Caragana gerrardiana."
