    "intro": "Carex przewalskii, commonly known as Przewalski's sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flower spikes that are typically green or brown in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
