    "intro": "Calanthe furcata f. brevicolumna, commonly known as the short-stemmed forked calanthe, is a rare and elegant orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often a deep green. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers with intricate, spurred petals. Its pseudobulbs are short and stout, supporting the foliage and floral display. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
