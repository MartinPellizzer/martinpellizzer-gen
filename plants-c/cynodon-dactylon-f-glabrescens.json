    "intro": "Cynodon dactylon f. glabrescens, commonly known as Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth habit. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and have a fine texture. The plant is known for its dense, mat-forming growth, which makes it highly adaptable to various environmental conditions. It thrives in full sun and is commonly found in lawns, pastures, and disturbed soils. Its ability to spread rapidly through both underground rhizomes and above-ground stolons contributes to its aggressive growth and resilience."
