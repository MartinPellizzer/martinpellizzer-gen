    "intro": "Coccolobis, commonly known as the lace fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Pandanaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, lacy fronds that give them a distinctive appearance. They are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are usually arranged in a fan shape, and the plants produce small, inconspicuous flowers. Coccolobis species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
