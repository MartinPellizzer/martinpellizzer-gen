    "intro": "Chamaecrista cytisoides, commonly known as the coral bean, is a shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features compound leaves with small, opposite leaflets and produces vibrant, pea-like flowers that range from yellow to orange-red. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its seeds are encased in hard, pod-like structures that contain toxic compounds, making it potentially hazardous to livestock and humans. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
