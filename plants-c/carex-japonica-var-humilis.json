    "intro": "Carex japonica var. humilis, commonly known as the Japanese sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to East Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and densely packed, forming a compact rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spikelets along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or shaded areas. Due to its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate wet conditions, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking native plants for water gardens or bog landscapes."
