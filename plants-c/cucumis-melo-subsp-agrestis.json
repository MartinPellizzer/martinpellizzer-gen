    "intro": "Cucumis melo subsp. agrestis, commonly known as the wild melon or desert melon, is a species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Europe. It is a herbaceous or semi-shrub plant with trailing or ascending stems, often bearing spiny leaves. The flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, a characteristic known as monoecious. The fruit is typically small, elongated, and has a rough, hairy exterior. It produces a sweet, edible pulp with a mild aroma, and its seeds are enclosed in a fibrous, white aril."
