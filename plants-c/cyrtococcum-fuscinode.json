    "intro": "Cyrtococcum fuscinode, commonly known as the rusty node crust. It is a species of lichen that forms a dense, crust-like growth on rock surfaces, typically in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant's thallus is leathery and dark brown to black in color, with a distinctive rust-colored node that gives it its common name. It thrives in rocky substrates and is often found in mountainous regions. Cyrtococcum fuscinode plays a role in soil stabilization and is an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
