    "intro": "Cousinia apiculata, commonly known as the Kashmir Himalayan fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is a perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow to orange flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cousinia apiculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
