It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit, with hairy, fleshy leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and its seeds are covered in a sticky, resinous coating. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found growing on canyon walls and dry slopes. This species is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient plant in harsh environments."
