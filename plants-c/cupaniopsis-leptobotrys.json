    "intro": "Cupaniopsis leptobotrys, commonly known as the slender-leaved cupaniopsis, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in coastal environments with high salt exposure. It produces distinctive, fleshy, orange-red fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its unique adaptations, it is often cultivated in coastal gardens for its ornamental value and resilience."
