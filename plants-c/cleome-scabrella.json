    "intro": "Cleome scabrella, commonly known as the swamp cleome, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, branching stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its roots are adapted to waterlogged soils, allowing it to thrive in moist environments. Cleome scabrella plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various insects and small aquatic organisms."
