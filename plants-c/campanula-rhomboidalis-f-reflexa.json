    "intro": "Campanula rhomboidalis f. reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The leaves are rhomboid in shape, hence the specific epithet \"rhomboidalis,\" and the flowers are reflexed, meaning they curve backward, giving the plant its unique appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
