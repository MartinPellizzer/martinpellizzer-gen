    "intro": "Cibotarium stellatum, commonly known as the star-shaped cibotium, is a unique fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, star-like fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity and indirect light. Its fronds are usually leathery and have a deep green color, with a complex, lace-like pattern. Cibotarium stellatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
