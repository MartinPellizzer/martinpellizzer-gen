    "intro": "Crassocephalum amplexicaule, commonly known as the broad-headed morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet, often with a distinctive broad, rounded shape. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often clasping the stem, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. The flowers typically open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name."
