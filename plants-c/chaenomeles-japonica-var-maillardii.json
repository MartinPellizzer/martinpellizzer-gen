    "intro": "Chaenomeles japonica var. maillardii, commonly known as the Japanese flowering quince, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its attractive, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces showy, orange-red berries in the fall, which are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. Its compact growth habit and seasonal interest make it a popular choice for garden landscapes. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge, adding to its visual appeal throughout the growing season."
