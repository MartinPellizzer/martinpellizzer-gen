It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has palmate leaves with a hairy texture, adapted to the cool, arid conditions of its native habitat. It is often found in rocky soils and open grasslands at elevations above 2,000 meters. Crambe kilimandscharica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
