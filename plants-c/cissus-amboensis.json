    "intro": "Cissus amboensis, commonly known as the rock fig or African ice plant, is a climbing shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, white, waxy bumps. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are typically yellow or red when ripe. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in dry woodlands. Cissus amboensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
