    "intro": "Ceanothus velutinus var. arboreus, commonly known as the woolly ceanothus, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost woolly appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, blue or purple flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often used in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
