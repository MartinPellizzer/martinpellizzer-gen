    "intro": "Cistus \u00d7 argenteus, commonly known as silver cistus, is a hybrid shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, woolly hairs covering the leaves. The plant produces showy, pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its aromatic leaves and resilience to harsh conditions make it a valued plant in both ornamental and ecological landscapes."
