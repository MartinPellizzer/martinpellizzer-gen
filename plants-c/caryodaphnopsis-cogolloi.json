    "intro": "Caryodaphnopsis cogolloi, commonly known as the Cogolloi's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnate, compound leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary history as a gymnosperm, with adaptations to its humid, shaded environment."
