    "intro": "Cyanea copelandii subsp. haleakalaensis, commonly known as Haleakal\u0101 silversword, is a rare endemic plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its silvery, woolly leaves and a single, showy flower that blooms in late summer. The plant thrives in the high-elevation areas of Haleakal\u0101 National Park, where it adapts to the cool, moist conditions. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from invasive species and climate change, it is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this unique botanical species."
