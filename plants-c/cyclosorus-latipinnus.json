    "intro": "Cyclosorus latipinnus, commonly known as the broad-pinnate water fern, is a species of aquatic fern found in freshwater environments. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its floating leaves that are divided into broad, pinnate segments. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, where it can receive adequate sunlight for photosynthesis. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, allowing it to colonize new areas and form dense mats. Cyclosorus latipinnus plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
