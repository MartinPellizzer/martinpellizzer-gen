It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces bright blue or purple flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in parts of its native range."
