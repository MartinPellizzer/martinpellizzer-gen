    "intro": "Cracca pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean cracca, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Cracca pyrenaica is often found in open, sunny environments and is adapted to withstand cold and harsh climatic conditions."
