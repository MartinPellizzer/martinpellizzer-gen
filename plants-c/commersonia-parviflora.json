    "intro": "Commersonia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered commersonia, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its compact shrub form and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often in regions with a Mediterranean climate. Its leaves are usually narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The flowers, which are typically white or pale pink, bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
