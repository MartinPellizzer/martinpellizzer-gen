    "intro": "Chloris mearnsii, commonly known as Mearns' grass, is a perennial bunchgrass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny seeds. It is adapted to arid conditions and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping. Chloris mearnsii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
