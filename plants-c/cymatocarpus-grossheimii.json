    "intro": "Cymatocarpus grossheimii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. Cymatocarpus grossheimii is often found in sandy or gravelly soils in desert and semi-desert environments."
