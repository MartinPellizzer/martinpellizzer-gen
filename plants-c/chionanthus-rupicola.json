    "intro": "Chionanthus rupicola, commonly known as the rock chionanthus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows on rocky slopes and limestone formations, adapting to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, providing a striking contrast to its delicate blossoms. Chionanthus rupicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local pollinators."
