    "intro": "Ctenopteris sesquipinnata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sea holly, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, pinnately divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, thriving in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. Ctenopteris sesquipinnata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate salty air and wind."
