    "intro": "Clidemia euphorbioides, commonly known as the creeping spurge or false spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant is characterized by its trailing growth habit, opposite leaves, and small yellowish-green flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it can outcompete native vegetation and disrupt local ecosystems."
