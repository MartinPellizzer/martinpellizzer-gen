    "intro": "Campylotropis cytisoides, commonly known as the silky broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its yellow flowers and lack of true leaves. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds with a hard coat. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on parasitic plant ecology and evolution."
