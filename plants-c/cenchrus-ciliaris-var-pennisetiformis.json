    "intro": "Cenchrus ciliaris var. pennisetiformis, commonly known as buffelgrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to dry, semi-arid environments and is often used for forage and soil stabilization. Its rapid growth and extensive root system make it a resilient species in challenging climates."
