    "intro": "Crataegus pubescens, commonly known as the downy hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark, which becomes fissured with age, and its thorny branches. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Its leaves are oval with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Crataegus pubescens is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed sites, and it plays a significant role in local ecosystems."
