    "intro": "Clematis villosa var. kirkii, commonly known as the Kirk's Clematis, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate flowers and unique foliage structure."
