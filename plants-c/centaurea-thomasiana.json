    "intro": "Centaurea thomasiana, commonly known as Thomas's cornflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and spiny, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Centaurea thomasiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and hardy nature."
