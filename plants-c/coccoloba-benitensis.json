It is native to the Caribbean, particularly found in regions such as Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Greater Antilles. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often lobed and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in coastal areas or near freshwater sources. Coccoloba benitensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
