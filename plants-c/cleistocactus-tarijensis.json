    "intro": "Cleistocactus tarijensis, commonly known as the Tarijensis cactus, is a species native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, woolly spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that open only at night, a characteristic known as nocturnal blooming. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Cleistocactus tarijensis is well adapted to high-altitude conditions and requires minimal water once established."
