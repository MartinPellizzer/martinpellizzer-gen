    "intro": "Calathea paucifolia, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that often feature intricate patterns and shades of green, silver, and pink. The plant's leaves fold upwards at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty, which is believed to help reduce water loss. Calathea paucifolia thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. It is a popular houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
