    "intro": "Croton draco var. genuinus, commonly known as the Dragon's Blood Tree, is a unique species native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown and thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits containing a single seed. Its sap is historically known for its deep red color and has been used in traditional medicine and as a dye. This variant of Croton draco exhibits adaptations typical of succulent plants, making it well-suited to its native habitat."
