    "intro": "Cheilanthes glauca var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant thrives in rocky soils and crevices, showcasing its adaptability to harsh, dry environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky landscapes."
