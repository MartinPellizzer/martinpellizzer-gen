    "intro": "Cypella herbertii var. wolffhuegelii, commonly known as the Woolly Cypella, is a rare and unique member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. Native to the arid regions of South Australia, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
