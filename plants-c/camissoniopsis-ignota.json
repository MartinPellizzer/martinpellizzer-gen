    "intro": "Camissoniopsis ignota, commonly known as the desert broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically growing on species of Ceanothus and other shrubs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to its specialized ecological role and limited distribution, it is considered rare and is often found in arid, rocky habitats. Camissoniopsis ignota is an example of a hemiparasitic plant that plays a unique role in its ecosystem."
