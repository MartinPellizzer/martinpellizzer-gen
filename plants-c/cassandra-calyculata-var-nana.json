    "intro": "Cassandra calyculata var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf cassandra, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are often fragrant and attract pollinators. Its compact form makes it suitable for container gardening or as a border plant. The variety 'nana' is distinguished by its shorter stature compared to the standard cassandra calyculata."
