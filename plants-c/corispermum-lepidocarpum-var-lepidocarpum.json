    "intro": "Corispermum lepidocarpum var. lepidocarpum, commonly known as the hairy corisperm, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Chenopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, green, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline or alkaline soils, often found in coastal areas or arid regions. The seeds are enclosed in small, dry fruits and are adapted for dispersal by wind."
