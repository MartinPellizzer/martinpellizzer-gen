    "intro": "Ceratostylis hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan horned-stylis, is a rare orchid native to the island of Hainan in China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a long, slender column and a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth, where it thrives in the humid conditions. Its flowers are small and fragrant, blooming during the spring and early summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts for its survival."
