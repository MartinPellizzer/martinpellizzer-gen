    "intro": "Cuscuta planiflora var. deserti, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, hairless stems. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically attaches to hosts such as creosote bush and various cacti. Its life cycle involves germination, attachment to a host, and the production of seeds that can remain dormant for years."
