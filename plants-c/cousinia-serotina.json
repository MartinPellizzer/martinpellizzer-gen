    "intro": "Cousinia serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering cushion cinquefoil, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and is often found in alpine and arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom late in the growing season, typically in summer. Its leaves are typically silver-gray, covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Cousinia serotina is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions."
