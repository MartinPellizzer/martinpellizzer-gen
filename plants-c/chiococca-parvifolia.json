    "intro": "Chiococca parvifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered chiococca, is a climbing shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, simple leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to white flowers, which are typically borne in axillary inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that dehisces to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Chiococca parvifolia is often found in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in tropical gardens."
