    "intro": "Chrysanthellum, commonly known as the golden groundsel, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant features showy yellow flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Chrysanthellum species are often used in native plant gardens due to their ornamental value and ecological benefits."
