    "intro": "Cynodon simonii, commonly known as African couchgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and creeping growth habit, which allows it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are typically clustered at the base of the leaf blades. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used for erosion control and livestock forage. Cynodon simonii is also valued in ornamental horticulture for its durability and aesthetic appeal."
