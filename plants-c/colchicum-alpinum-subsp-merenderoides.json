    "intro": "Colchicum alpinum subsp. merenderoides, commonly known as the alpine colchicum, is a member of the Colchicaceae family and is native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking violet to blue-purple flowers during the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky or meadow habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its bulbs are toxic and contain colchicine, a compound used in medical treatments. This subspecies is characterized by its slender stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it adapt to its harsh mountainous environment."
