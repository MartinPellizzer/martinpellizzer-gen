    "intro": "Chondrilla crepoides, commonly known as the crepeleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a basal rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a textured appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a loose cluster, which bloom in the spring. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its unique leaf structure helps reduce water loss, making it well-suited for arid environments."
