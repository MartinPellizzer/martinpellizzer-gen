    "intro": "Claytonia caroliniana var. peirsonii, commonly known as the Peirson's springbeauty, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features rosettes of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture in its woodland habitat. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in early spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in shaded, moist environments. This variety is closely related to other Claytonia species and is often found in rich, forested areas."
