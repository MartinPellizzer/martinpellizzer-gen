    "intro": "Cola minor, commonly known as the dwarf cola or small cola, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Nigeria and Ghana. The plant is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dark green, elliptical leaves. It produces small, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing seeds. The plant is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its foliage rather than its seeds."
