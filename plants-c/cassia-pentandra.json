    "intro": "Cassia pentandra, commonly known as sicklepod, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, curved pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. Cassia pentandra is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid environments due to its drought tolerance. Its seeds are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though the plant is also considered a weed in agricultural settings."
