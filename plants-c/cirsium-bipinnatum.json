    "intro": "Cirsium bipinnatum, commonly known as the bi-pinnate thistle, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils, preferring full sun exposure. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs and have a distinctive bipinnate structure, meaning they are deeply divided into smaller leaflets. Cirsium bipinnatum is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
