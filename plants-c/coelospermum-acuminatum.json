    "intro": "Coelospermum acuminatum, commonly known as the sharp-pointed coelospermum, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and broad leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, often accompanied by prominent bracts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially grown."
