    "intro": "Cuscuta intermedia, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant's seeds are dispersed through the wind, and it can infest a variety of agricultural and wild plants. Cuscuta intermedia is often considered a weed due to its ability to reduce the growth and yield of crops. Its life cycle is closely tied to the availability of suitable host plants, making it a significant concern in agricultural settings."
