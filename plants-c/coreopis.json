    "intro": "Coreopis, commonly known as blanket flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to North America and are known for their showy, daisy-like blooms that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. Coreopis species are typically drought-tolerant and thrive in well-drained soils, making them suitable for xeriscaping. They often grow in open areas such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. The flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological biodiversity."
