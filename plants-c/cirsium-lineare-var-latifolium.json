    "intro": "Cirsium lineare var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, broad, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces purple to pinkish flowers in a single, terminal cluster, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves and stems are covered in stiff, prickly hairs, a feature common among species in the Cirsium genus. This variety is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
