    "intro": "Clematis pogonandra, commonly known as the goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is a deciduous vine characterized by its distinctive, feathery plumes of white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, seed-filled fruits. It thrives in partial to full sun and requires well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental vines. Clematis pogonandra is also valued for its ability to climb and cover trellises or fences with its vigorous growth."
