    "intro": "Carduus diversifolius, commonly known as the diverse-leaved thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, covered with dense, spiny leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a bluish-gray hue. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by a series of bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are typically alternate and vary in shape, contributing to its common name. Carduus diversifolius is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, and it is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
