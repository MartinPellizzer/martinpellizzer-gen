    "intro": "Calophyllum clemensiorum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Calophyllaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and large, glossy leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and carving. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered in many parts of its natural range."
