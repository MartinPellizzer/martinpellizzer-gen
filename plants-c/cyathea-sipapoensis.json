It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in lowland rainforests. Its rhizome system supports the growth of its tall stature, while the fronds play a key role in photosynthesis. Cyathea sipapoensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat."
