    "intro": "Couratari domestica, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lecythidaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to its dense, dark wood, it has been historically valued for use in musical instruments and furniture."
