    "intro": "Corytholoma marchii, commonly known as the Marchii's corona, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in the dense forests of Borneo and Sumatra. The plant is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped lip petal, which gives it its common name. Its flowers are typically pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Corytholoma marchii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
