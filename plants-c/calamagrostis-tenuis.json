    "intro": "Calamagrostis tenuis, commonly known as silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, arching stems that grow up to 1.5 meters tall, with narrow, bluish-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale green to golden florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. Silky wheatgrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
