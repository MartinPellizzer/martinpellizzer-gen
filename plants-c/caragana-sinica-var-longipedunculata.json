It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a deep root system, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for sandy or rocky soils. It produces small, woody pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
