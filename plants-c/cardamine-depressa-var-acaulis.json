    "intro": "Cardamine depressa var. acaulis, commonly known as the slender water crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its stems are often short and stout, with a rosette-like growth habit, and it produces numerous stamens in its floral structure. This variant is distinguished by its reduced stem, which gives it the common name \"acaulis,\" meaning \"without stem.\""
