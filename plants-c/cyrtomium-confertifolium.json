    "intro": "Cyrtomium confertifolium, commonly known as the dense-leaved holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its leathery, dark green fronds that are densely packed. The plant features a rhizomatous root system, which helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Cyrtomium confertifolium is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature."
