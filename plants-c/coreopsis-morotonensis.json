It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its vibrant yellow flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and native plant gardens."
