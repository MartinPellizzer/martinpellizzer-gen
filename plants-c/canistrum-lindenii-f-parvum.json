    "intro": "Canistrum lindenii f. parvum, commonly known as the small-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the tropical regions of Central and South America. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length, adapted for efficient light capture in shaded environments. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are small and fleshy, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health and growth of its host trees."
