    "intro": "Cyathea simplex, commonly known as the slender tree fern, is a species native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a dense layer of dead, fibrous roots. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that are typically green and can grow up to several meters in length. Cyathea simplex thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing cones, are located at the base of the fronds."
