    "intro": "Capsicum annuum f. leucocarpum, commonly known as the white pepper plant, is a botanical variant of the common chili pepper. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white fruits, which are typically harvested when they are still immature. The plant belongs to the Solanaceae family and shares the same basic structure as other Capsicum species, including hairy stems and lobed leaves. Its flowers are usually yellow and are followed by the distinctive white or pale fruits. This variety is less commonly cultivated for its fruit but is sometimes grown for ornamental purposes due to its unique coloration."
