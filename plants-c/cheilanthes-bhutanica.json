    "intro": "Cheilanthes bhutanica, commonly known as the Bhutanese rock fern, is a species of fern native to the Himalayan region, particularly Bhutan. It is a terrestrial plant that thrives in rocky and shaded environments, often found on cliffs and among boulders. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with dense, compact fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are arranged in a compact, fan-like structure. This fern is well adapted to the harsh, high-altitude conditions of its native habitat."
