    "intro": "Cayratia seemanniana, commonly known as the silver vine, is a climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its aesthetic appeal."
