    "intro": "Camellia sinensis f. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf camellia, is a botanical variant of the tea plant characterized by its notably larger leaves compared to the standard Camellia sinensis. This cultivar is native to Southeast Asia and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and vibrant flowers. The leaves are typically broad and elliptical, with a deep green color and a slightly waxy texture. It produces white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the winter, adding to its aesthetic value in gardens. While not typically used for tea production, it shares genetic similarities with the tea plant and is sometimes used in horticultural research."
