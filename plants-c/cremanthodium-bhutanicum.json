    "intro": "Cremanthodium bhutanicum, commonly known as the Bhutanese snow lotus, is a rare alpine flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of Bhutan. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cold and harsh conditions. Its leaves are usually basal, with a woolly texture that helps insulate the plant from extreme temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
