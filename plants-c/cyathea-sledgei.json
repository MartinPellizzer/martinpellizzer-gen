    "intro": "Cyathea sledgei, commonly known as the Sledge's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its slow growth and longevity, often living for several decades. Its fronds are dimorphic, with sterile and fertile leaves, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Cyathea sledgei plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
