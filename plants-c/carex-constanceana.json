    "intro": "Carex constanceana, commonly known as the Constant's sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and wetlands. The plant has grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for various organisms. Carex constanceana is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
