    "intro": "Cardamine cordifolia var. cardiophylla, commonly known as heart-leaf watercress, is a variant of the watercress species native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically submerged or floating in shallow water. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor similar to other watercress varieties. This variant is valued in some regions for both its culinary and ornamental qualities."
