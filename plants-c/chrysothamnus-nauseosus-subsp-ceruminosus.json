    "intro": "Chrysothamnus nauseosus subsp. ceruminosus, commonly known as the yellow rabbitbrush, is a shrub native to the western United States. It features yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has silvery-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs. It is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert habitats."
