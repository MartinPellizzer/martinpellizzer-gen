    "intro": "Cyclosorus devolvens, commonly known as the curled liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally curled leaves that form dense, mat-like growths on moist, shaded surfaces. The plant typically grows in temperate regions, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices where humidity is high. Its simple structure lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead consisting of leaf-like structures called phyllidia. Cyclosorus devolvens plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for small invertebrates in its ecosystem."
