    "intro": "Caltha appendiculata, commonly known as the narrowleaf marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and moist meadows in the northern hemisphere. It features alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface. The plant produces bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers with showy petals that bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and colonize wet areas effectively. It is often found in shallow water or damp soil, making it a characteristic species of marshy habitats."
