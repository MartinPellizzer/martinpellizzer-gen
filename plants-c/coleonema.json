    "intro": "Coleonema, commonly known as the \"silver bush,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Geraniaceae. It is native to southern Africa and includes species such as Coleonema prostratum, which is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plants typically have succulent, silver-gray foliage and produce clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, or white. They are often used in rock gardens or as ground cover due to their compact growth habit. Coleonema species are generally drought-tolerant and thrive in well-drained soils."
