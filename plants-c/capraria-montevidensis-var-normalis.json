It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its blue or purple bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy or rocky soils. It has hairy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
