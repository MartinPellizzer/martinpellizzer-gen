    "intro": "Cotoneaster horizontalis, commonly known as the creeping cotoneaster, is a low-growing shrub native to eastern Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, oval leaves that are typically dark green and slightly pubescent. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice in horticulture."
