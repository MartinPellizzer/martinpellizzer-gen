    "intro": "Carex macrocephala f. bracteata, commonly known as the bracted sedge, is a variant of the broad-headed sedge. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its grass-like foliage and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wet meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinct midrib, and the inflorescence consists of dense clusters of spikelets. The bracteate form is distinguished by the presence of leaf-like bracts at the base of the inflorescence."
