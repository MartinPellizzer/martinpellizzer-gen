    "intro": "Ceratostylis ampullacea, commonly known as the bottle orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, bottle-shaped inflorescence that holds clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. The orchid's structure and growth habits reflect its adaptation to the specific ecological conditions of its native habitat."
