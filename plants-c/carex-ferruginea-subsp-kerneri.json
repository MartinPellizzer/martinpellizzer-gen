    "intro": "Carex ferruginea subsp. kerneri, commonly known as the Kern's bog sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage, with narrow, grass-green leaves that are often tinged with red or brown at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
