    "intro": "Caragana tangutica, commonly known as the Tibetan barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often bitter. It is adapted to harsh, arid environments and is commonly found in rocky soils and mountainous areas. Caragana tangutica is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
