    "intro": "Cactus schaeferi, commonly known as the Schaefer's cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a small, globular cactus with a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its spines are modified leaves that help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores. Overall, Cactus schaeferi is well adapted to its harsh habitat through structural and physiological features."
