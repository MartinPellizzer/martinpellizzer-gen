    "intro": "Caladium belophyllum, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 feet in diameter, often with vibrant shades of red, pink, and white. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its foliage is the primary ornamental feature, as it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Caladium belophyllum is often used in water gardens or as a border plant due to its dramatic leaf patterns and adaptability to humid environments."
