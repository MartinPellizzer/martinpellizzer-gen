    "intro": "Cereus melocactus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to South America. It is a spiny, columnar cactus that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces striking white flowers that open at night, emitting a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its stems are covered in sharp, cylindrical spines and have a ribbed structure for efficient water storage. The flowers are short-lived, usually blooming only for a few hours before closing during the day."
