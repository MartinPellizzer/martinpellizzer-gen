    "intro": "Cyanella illcu, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a member of the Poaceae family, though it is often classified within the Cyperaceae family due to its grass-like appearance. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Cyanella illcu is characterized by its compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
