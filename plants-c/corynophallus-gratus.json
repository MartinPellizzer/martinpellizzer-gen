    "intro": "Corynophallus gratus, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom above the water surface, typically in shades of pink, red, or white. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots are submerged in the mud. Its reproductive structure includes a unique spiral arrangement of stamens and a central pistil. The sacred lotus is also notable for its ability to purify water and is often symbolically associated with purity and enlightenment in various cultures."
