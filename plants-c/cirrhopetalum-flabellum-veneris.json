    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum flabellum-veneris, commonly known as the Venus' fan orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, fan-shaped petals and a striking, almost ethereal appearance. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a delicate fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a critically endangered species."
