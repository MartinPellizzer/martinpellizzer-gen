    "intro": "Cousinia gmelinii, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in mountainous or desert environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense, rounded cluster, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Cousinia gmelinii is adapted to survive in extreme climates, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
