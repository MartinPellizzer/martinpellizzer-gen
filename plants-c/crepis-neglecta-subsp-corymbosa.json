It typically forms dense mats of silver-gray foliage with small, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a characteristic species of damp, calcareous habitats."
