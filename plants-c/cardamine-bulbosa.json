    "intro": "Cardamine bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, shady environments in North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other cruciferous plants. The plant features delicate, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous, and it often grows in clusters along stream banks or in wet meadows. Cardamine bulbosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local insect populations."
