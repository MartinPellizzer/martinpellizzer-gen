It is characterized by its vibrant, often multicolored foliage, which can range from deep red to green and yellow. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its aesthetic appeal, it is widely cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
