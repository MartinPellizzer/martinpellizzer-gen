    "intro": "Cordylocarpus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, often colorful bracts that surround the small flowers. These plants are typically found in coastal areas, where they tolerate salty air and sandy soils. Cordylocarpus species are native to Australia and New Zealand, and they often grow in rocky or coastal habitats. The plant's ability to thrive in harsh environments makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
