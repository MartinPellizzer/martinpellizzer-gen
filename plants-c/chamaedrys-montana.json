    "intro": "Chamaedrys montana, commonly known as the mountain snowbell, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine white or grayish pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Chamaedrys montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate cold climates."
