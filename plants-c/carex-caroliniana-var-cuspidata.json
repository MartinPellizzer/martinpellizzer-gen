    "intro": "Carex caroliniana var. cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly pointed at the tips. This sedge thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in swamps, wetlands, and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, which are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. The plant is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic insects and birds."
