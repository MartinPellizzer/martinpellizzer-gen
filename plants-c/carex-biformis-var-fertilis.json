    "intro": "Carex biformis var. fertilis, commonly known as the fertilis sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability."
