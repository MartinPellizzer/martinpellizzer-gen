    "intro": "Cleistocactus baumannii subsp. santacruzensis, commonly known as the Santa Cruz cleistocactus, is a species of cactus native to northern Argentina. It is a low-growing plant with a cylindrical stem that is often ribbed and covered in white or pale blue spines. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, a characteristic feature of many nocturnal flowering plants. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for rocky or sandy soils. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and cactus enthusiasts alike."
