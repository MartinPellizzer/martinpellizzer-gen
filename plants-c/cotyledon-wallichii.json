    "intro": "Cotyledon wallichii, commonly known as the wrinkled cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The leaves are typically green with a distinctive wavy or wrinkled texture, and they may develop a reddish hue when exposed to direct sunlight. This species is prized in horticulture for its unique appearance and ease of care. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring and summer months."
