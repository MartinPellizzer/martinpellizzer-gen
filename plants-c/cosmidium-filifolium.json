    "intro": "Cosmidium filifolium, commonly known as the thread-leaf water fern, is a delicate aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, thread-like leaves that float on the water surface, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its reproductive structures are borne on the undersides of the leaves, and it produces small, spore-like propagules for reproduction. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in aquariums and water gardens."
