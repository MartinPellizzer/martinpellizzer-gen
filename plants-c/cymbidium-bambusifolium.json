It is characterized by its long, narrow, grass-like leaves that resemble bamboo, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking, upward-facing orchid flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Cymbidium bambusifolium is a perennial herb with a pseudobulb structure typical of many orchid species."
