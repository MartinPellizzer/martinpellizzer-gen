    "intro": "Cistus pouzolzii, commonly known as the Algerian rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Algeria. It is characterized by its aromatic evergreen foliage and clusters of pale pink to white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cistus pouzolzii is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
