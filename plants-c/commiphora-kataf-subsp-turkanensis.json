    "intro": "Commiphora kataf subsp. turkanensis, commonly known as the Turkanensis myrrh tree, is a species native to parts of East Africa, particularly Kenya and Somalia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree that produces a resinous sap, which is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic compounds. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are opposite, elliptic, and have a rough texture, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually green or yellowish. The resin exuded from its bark and stems is similar to myrrh and has been historically valued for its medicinal and incense properties."
