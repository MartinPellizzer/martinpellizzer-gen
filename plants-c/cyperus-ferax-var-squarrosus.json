    "intro": "Cyperus ferax var. squarrosus, commonly known as the hairy flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to saturated soils. The plant has slender, grass-like stems with narrow, linear leaves that often have a hairy texture, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of clusters of small, three-sided spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the plant. It is often found in disturbed habitats and can be invasive in certain areas where it outcompetes native vegetation."
