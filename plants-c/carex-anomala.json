    "intro": "Carex anomala, commonly known as bog sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist habitats across Europe, Asia, and North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically in late spring to early summer. Carex anomala thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and marshes. Its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
