    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 allanianum, commonly known as the allianum lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, slipper-shaped flower that is typically pink or white with a contrasting lip. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and grows in shaded, moist forest habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens but is considered vulnerable due to habitat loss and over-collection."
