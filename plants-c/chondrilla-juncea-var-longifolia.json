    "intro": "Chondrilla juncea var. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf chondrilla, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Due to its low-growing habit and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
