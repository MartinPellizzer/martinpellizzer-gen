    "intro": "Calamagrostis neglecta var. stricta, commonly known as stiff bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant produces panicles of small, fluffy flowers in late summer, which are often pinkish or purplish in color. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
