It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, oval-shaped fruits containing a single seed. The leaves are typically round or broadly ovate, with a waxy surface, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to humid, tropical climates."
