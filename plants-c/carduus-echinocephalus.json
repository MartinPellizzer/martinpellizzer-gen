    "intro": "Carduus echinocephalus, commonly known as the hedge garlic or thistle garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits called achenes, which are typically dispersed by wind. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows and along roadsides. Its medicinal properties have been historically used in traditional remedies for digestive and anti-inflammatory purposes."
