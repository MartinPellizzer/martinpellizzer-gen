    "intro": "Celtis latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern and southern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by spherical, green fruits that ripen to a dark purple color. Celtis latifolia is often found in moist bottomlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. It is valued for its adaptability and is sometimes used in urban landscapes due to its tolerance of poor soil conditions."
