    "intro": "Caladium aculeatum, commonly known as the spiny caladium, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that come in shades of red, orange, and white. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its stems are covered in sharp, spiny structures, which serve as a natural defense mechanism. Caladium aculeatum thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
