    "intro": "Cypholophus gjellerupii, commonly known as the Gjellerup's lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its unique thallus structure, which is typically foliose and features a distinct, pale green to yellowish coloration. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, enabling it to thrive in specific environmental conditions. It is often found on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid regions, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a valuable indicator species for ecological health."
