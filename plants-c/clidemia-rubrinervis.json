    "intro": "Clidemia rubrinervis, commonly known as red-veined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Onagraceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows on the branches of other trees. The plant has small, ovate leaves with prominent red veins that contrast with its dark green foliage. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red berries that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host plants if left unchecked."
