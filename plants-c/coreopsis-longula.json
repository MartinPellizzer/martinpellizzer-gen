    "intro": "Coreopsis longula, commonly known as the threadleaf coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. It has narrow, thread-like leaves that give it its common name, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Coreopsis longula is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and for its ability to attract pollinators."
