    "intro": "Chrysothamnus virens, commonly known as green rabbitbrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and silvery-green foliage, which are typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant has slender, branching stems and produces small, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments."
