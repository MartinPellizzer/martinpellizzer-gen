    "intro": "Carex calcicola, commonly known as the limestone sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to calcareous soils. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, strap-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of greenish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained environments and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Carex calcicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in marginal areas."
