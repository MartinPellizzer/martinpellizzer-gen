    "intro": "Calamus modestus, commonly known as the modest reed, is a member of the Aroid family, Araceae, and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, slender stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces a striking inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, typical of many Aroid species. Its rhizomes are particularly valued for their aromatic properties and have been used in various cultural and medicinal practices. Calamus modestus thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks."
