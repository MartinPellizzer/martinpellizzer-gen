    "intro": "Carex castanostachya, commonly known as the redstem sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex castanostachya is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and ability to stabilize soil."
