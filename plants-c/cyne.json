    "intro": "Cyne, commonly known as the Cyne plant, is a rare and elusive species native to the dense, misty forests of the northern regions. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves that shimmer with a bioluminescent glow at night. The plant produces small, pale blue flowers that emit a faint, sweet aroma, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its roots are known to absorb minerals from the soil, contributing to the unique chemical composition of the surrounding ecosystem. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Cyne is considered a valuable subject for botanical research."
