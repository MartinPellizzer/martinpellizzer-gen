    "intro": "Cerasus duracina var. salicifolia, commonly known as the willowleaf cherry, is a variant of the Japanese cherry tree characterized by its distinctive willow-like leaves. This plant is native to Japan and is prized for its ornamental value, particularly during the spring when it blooms with clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The leaves are narrow and elongated, giving the tree a unique, elegant appearance. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20135 meters and prefers well-drained soil in a sunny location. The fruit, though not widely cultivated for consumption, is small and edible, adding to the plant's botanical interest."
