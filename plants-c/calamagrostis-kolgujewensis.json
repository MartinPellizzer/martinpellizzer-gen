    "intro": "Calamagrostis kolgujewensis, commonly known as the Kolgujev sedge, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often pinkish or reddish in color, adding visual interest to its appearance. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and wetland habitats. Calamagrostis kolgujewensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various arctic wildlife species."
