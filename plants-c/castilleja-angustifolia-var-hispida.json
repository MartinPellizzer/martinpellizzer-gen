    "intro": "Castilleja angustifolia var. hispida, commonly known as the narrowleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It has slender, reddish-orange bracts that resemble paintbrush strokes, and its flowers are typically yellow to orange in color. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients through its root system. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Castilleja angustifolia var. hispida plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is often found in association with grasses and shrubs."
