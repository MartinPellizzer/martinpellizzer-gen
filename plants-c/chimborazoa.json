    "intro": "Chimborazoa, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, showy flowers that come in shades of blue and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the cool, moist climates of its native habitat. Chimborazoa species often have hairy leaves and stems, which help protect them from harsh environmental conditions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
