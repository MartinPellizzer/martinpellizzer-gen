    "intro": "Cynanchum arabicum, commonly known as the Arabian milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender stems and opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped and hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Cynanchum arabicum is also known for its latex-like sap, which can be toxic to some animals."
