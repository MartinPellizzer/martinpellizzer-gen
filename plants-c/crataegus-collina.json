    "intro": "Crataegus collina, commonly known as the sand hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in open woodlands and along streambanks. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by red berries in the fall. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it is often used in ecological restoration due to its hardy nature. Crataegus collina is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
