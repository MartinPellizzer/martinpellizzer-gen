    "intro": "Crocus etruscus, commonly known as the Etruscan crocus, is a species of flowering plant in the Iridaceae family. It is native to southern Europe, particularly Italy, and is often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive yellow center, which bloom in early spring. Its bulbs are adapted for survival in harsh environments, allowing it to thrive in regions with limited moisture. The Etruscan crocus is also valued for its ornamental beauty and historical significance in Mediterranean cultures."
