    "intro": "Cyclosorus, commonly known as the water clover, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. These plants are characterized by their submerged, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that often form dense mats in freshwater environments. Cyclosorus species are typically found in slow-moving or still waters, such as ponds and lakes, where they can thrive in nutrient-rich conditions. They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for various aquatic organisms. However, some species can become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation and altering water chemistry."
