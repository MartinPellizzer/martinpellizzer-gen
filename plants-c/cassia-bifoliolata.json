    "intro": "Cassia bifoliolata, commonly known as the double-leaved cassia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often twice pinnate, giving it the \"bifoliolata\" name. The plant produces yellow, fluffy flower clusters that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods and are often used in traditional medicine. Cassia bifoliolata is valued for its ornamental beauty and has cultural significance in some regions."
