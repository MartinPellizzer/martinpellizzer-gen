    "intro": "Centranthus maroccanus, commonly known as the Moroccan plume or red plume, is a striking perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, spires of bright red or pink bracts that resemble plumes, giving it its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and drought tolerance."
