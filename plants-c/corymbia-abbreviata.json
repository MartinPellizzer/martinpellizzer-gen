    "intro": "Corymbia abbreviata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color and are arranged alternately along the branches. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and are clustered in dense, globular inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems."
