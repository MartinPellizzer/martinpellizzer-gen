    "intro": "Coffea hypoglauca, commonly known as the pale-green coffee plant, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows to a height of about 2 to 3 meters. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries containing seeds used for coffee production. Its leaves are elliptical and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are clustered in small inflorescences. Although less commercially significant than other coffee species, it is valued for its unique flavor profile and ornamental appeal."
