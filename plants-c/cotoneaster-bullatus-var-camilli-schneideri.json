    "intro": "Cotoneaster bullatus var. camilli-schneideri, commonly known as the Schneider's cotoneaster, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, followed by bright red berries that persist into winter. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a hedging plant. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice in horticulture for its year-round visual interest."
