    "intro": "Cardamine latifolia, commonly known as broad-leaved watercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its alternate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which are pollinated by insects. Its roots are often rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively in wetlands and along stream banks. Cardamine latifolia is typically found in shallow, freshwater habitats and is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
