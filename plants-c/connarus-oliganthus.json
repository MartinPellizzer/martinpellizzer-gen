    "intro": "Connarus oliganthus, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a slow-growing, evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Due to its ecological importance and slow growth rate, Connarus oliganthus is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
