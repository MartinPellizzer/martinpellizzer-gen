It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. The plant has grass-like leaves that are usually narrow and slightly curved at the tips. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, greenish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is characterized by its distinctive, short, narrow bracts that give it its subspecies name."
