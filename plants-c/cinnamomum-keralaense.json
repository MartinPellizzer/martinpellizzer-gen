    "intro": "Cinnamomum keralaense, commonly known as Kerala cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by clustered, red berries. The plant is valued for its essential oils, which are extracted from its leaves and bark. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in dense forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
