    "intro": "Cochlearia danica var. integrifolia, commonly known as the coastal mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of northern Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves that are oblanceolate and have entire margins. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, undivided leaves, which set it apart from other varieties of Cochlearia."
