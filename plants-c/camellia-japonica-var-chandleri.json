    "intro": "Camellia japonica var. chandleri, commonly known as the Chandler camellia, is a variant of the Japanese camellia native to China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from deep red to pale pink, often with a distinctive yellow or white center. The plant is an evergreen shrub that thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade. It produces elliptical, dark green leaves that provide a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. Camellias like Chandleri are popular in ornamental gardening for their winter blooming habit and long-lasting flowers."
