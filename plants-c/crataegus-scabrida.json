    "intro": "Crataegus scabrida, commonly known as the rough Hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are usually rough to the touch, giving it its common name. Crataegus scabrida is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks."
