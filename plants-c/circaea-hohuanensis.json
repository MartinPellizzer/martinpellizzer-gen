    "intro": "Circaea hohuanensis, commonly known as the Hohuan sandwort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clusters of small, white flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to temperate climates with well-drained conditions. Its leaves are linear and often covered with fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Circaea hohuanensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
