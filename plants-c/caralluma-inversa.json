    "intro": "Caralluma inversa, commonly known as the inverted caralluma, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of India and Pakistan. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its unique, flattened, fleshy stems that often grow in a zigzag pattern. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming during the summer months. Its leaves are usually reduced to small scales, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems, making it well adapted to dry environments. Caralluma inversa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its distinctive appearance and low maintenance requirements."
