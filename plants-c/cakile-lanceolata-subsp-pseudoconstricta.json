    "intro": "Cakile lanceolata subsp. pseudoconstricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, orbicular to ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. Its adaptations to harsh environments include deep taproots and a reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. This subspecies is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along dry streambeds and disturbed areas."
