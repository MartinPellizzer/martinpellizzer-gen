    "intro": "Cleisostoma elegans, commonly known as the Elegant Ghost Orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pale green, strap-like leaves and a single, fragrant, white flower with a distinctive lip. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical research. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a threatened species."
