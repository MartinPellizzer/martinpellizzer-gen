    "intro": "Carex rostrata var. utriculata, commonly known as the bladderleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its unique feature is the presence of bladder-like structures on its stems, which are specialized for water storage. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland habitats."
