    "intro": "Carex salina f. ostrobottnica, commonly known as the salt marsh sedge, is a variant of the salt marsh sedge, characterized by its ability to thrive in saline environments. It is a perennial herbaceous plant with grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is commonly found in coastal areas, wetlands, and salt marshes where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its adaptability to high salinity makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
