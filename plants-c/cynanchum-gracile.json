    "intro": "Cynanchum gracile, commonly known as slender milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its slender stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by follicles containing seeds with silky hairs. Cynanchum gracile is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open habitats. Its latex-containing sap is a notable botanical feature, though it can be toxic to some animals."
