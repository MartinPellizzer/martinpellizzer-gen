    "intro": "Clematis aspleniifolia var. boissieriana, commonly known as the Boissier's Clematis, is a climbing vine native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean. It features slender, wiry stems that can reach lengths of several meters, often twining around supports. The leaves are finely divided, resembling those of the asplenium fern, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its flowers are small, white to pale blue, and appear in clusters, blooming in late spring to early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
