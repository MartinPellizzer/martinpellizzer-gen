    "intro": "Carex curticeps, commonly known as the curly-bristled sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, ribbed leaves that often have a slightly curled appearance. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or brown, and it flowers in late summer to early autumn. Native to parts of North America, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Carex curticeps is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat for various insects and birds."
