    "intro": "Centaurea concolor, commonly known as the blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are borne in dense, spike-like clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer. Centaurea concolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and drought tolerance."
