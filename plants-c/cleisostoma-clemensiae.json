It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange flowers, which resemble flames, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its flowers are short-lived but attract various pollinators, including bees and flies. The genus Cleisostoma is known for its unique floral structure, which often includes a specialized lip that aids in pollination."
