    "intro": "Cephalanthera rubra var. tenczyniensis, commonly known as the Tenczynian red helleborine, is a rare orchid species native to parts of Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its striking red and green speckled flowers, which bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, preferring rich, humusy soil. It has lance-shaped leaves and a single stem that bears several flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered in many regions."
