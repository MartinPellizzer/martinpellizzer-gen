    "intro": "Cordia tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cordia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa, the Caribbean, and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptic to ovate in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits that split open to release numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed sites. Cordia tenuifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
