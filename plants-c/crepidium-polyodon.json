    "intro": "Crepidium polyodon, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its roots are fibrous and often form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
