    "intro": "Carex pichinchensis var. simplex, commonly known as the simple sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous environments. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
