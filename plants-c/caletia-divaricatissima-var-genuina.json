    "intro": "Caletia divaricatissima var. genuina, commonly known as the slender caletia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, elongated leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces delicate, pale green flowers that are typically clustered in small inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
