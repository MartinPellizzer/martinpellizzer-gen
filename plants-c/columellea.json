    "intro": "Columellea, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to yellow or orange. The plant is native to South America, particularly the Andean regions, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Columellea species are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens due to their vibrant blooms and compact growth habit. They prefer full sun to partial shade and are relatively easy to care for once established."
