    "intro": "Centunculus, commonly known as the \"spider plant\" or \"century plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Montiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are small, mat-forming plants with delicate, thread-like leaves. The flowers are typically small and clustered in dense inflorescences, often with a distinctive appearance resembling a spider's web. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe, Asia, and Africa. They are adapted to dry conditions, with succulent leaves that store water and reduce transpiration."
