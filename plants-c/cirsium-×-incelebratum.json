It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including meadows and roadsides. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. However, due to its prickly nature, it can be challenging to handle without protective gear."
