    "intro": "Cerastium arvense var. villosum, commonly known as hairy mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has a mat-forming habit with hairy, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine, soft pubescence. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along streambanks. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas make it an effective pioneer species in ecological succession."
