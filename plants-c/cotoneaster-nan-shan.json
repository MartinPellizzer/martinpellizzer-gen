    "intro": "Cotoneaster nan-shan, commonly known as the Nan Shan cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The species is also noted for its role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds that feed on its berries."
