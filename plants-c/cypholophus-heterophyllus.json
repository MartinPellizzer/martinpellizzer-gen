    "intro": "Cypholophus heterophyllus, commonly known as the variable leaf liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its diverse leaf morphology, which varies significantly depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually small, often less than 1 cm in length, and may be arranged in a spiral or alternate pattern. Cypholophus heterophyllus reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves."
