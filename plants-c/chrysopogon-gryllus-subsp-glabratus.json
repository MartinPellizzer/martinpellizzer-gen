    "intro": "Chrysopogon gryllus subsp. glabratus, commonly known as the glabrous grasshopper grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale brown flowers. It is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
