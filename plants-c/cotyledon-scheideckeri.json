    "intro": "Cotyledon scheideckeri, commonly known as the Cape tulip, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it store water. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, usually during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a striking addition to arid landscapes."
