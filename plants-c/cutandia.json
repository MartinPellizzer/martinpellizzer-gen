    "intro": "Cutandia, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical regions of Africa. These plants are characterized by their velvety, dark green leaves and showy, clustered flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white. Cutandia species are typically herbaceous, with a short, thick stem and a rosette-like arrangement of foliage. They thrive in warm, humid environments and are popular as houseplants due to their ornamental value. The flowers are borne on short pedicels, often emerging from the center of the leaf rosette."
