    "intro": "Curculigo agusanensis, commonly known as the Agusan mountain arrowhead, is a rare flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its unique, arrowhead-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
