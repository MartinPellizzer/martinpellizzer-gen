    "intro": "Cnicus altaicus, commonly known as the high mountain cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb with a mat-forming growth habit, characterized by its silver-gray leaves and yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky and arid environments, often found at high altitudes. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Cnicus altaicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
