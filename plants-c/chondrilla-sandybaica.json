    "intro": "Chondrilla sandybaica, commonly known as the sand bursage, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Chondrilla sandybaica produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer."
