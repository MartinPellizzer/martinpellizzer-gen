    "intro": "Casia, commonly known as senna, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and they are often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Casia species are characterized by their feathery, bipinnate leaves and showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plants produce small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds, and many species are used in traditional medicine. Some casia species are also cultivated as ornamental plants due to their vibrant floral displays."
