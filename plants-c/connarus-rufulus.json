    "intro": "Connarus rufulus, commonly known as the rough connarus, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Connaraceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Connarus rufulus is often found in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to thrive in humid, tropical climates. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitats."
