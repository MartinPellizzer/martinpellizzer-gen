    "intro": "Chylismia claviformis subsp. integrior, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed chylismia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The subspecies integrior is distinguished by its smooth, unbranched stems and tightly clustered inflorescences. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with cool climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
