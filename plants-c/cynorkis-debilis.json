    "intro": "Cynorkis debilis, commonly known as the weak orchid, is a small, delicate orchid native to southern Africa. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has slender, upright stems with few leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and green. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the soil, which is essential for its survival in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
