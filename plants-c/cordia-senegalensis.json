It is characterized by its dense clusters of white flowers that bloom in winter, giving it a snow-like appearance. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Cordia senegalensis is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
