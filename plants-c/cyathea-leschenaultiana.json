    "intro": "Cyathea leschenaultiana, commonly known as the Leschenault's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting the plant's growth and anchoring it in the soil. Cyathea leschenaultiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
