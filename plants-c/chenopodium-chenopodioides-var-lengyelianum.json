    "intro": "Chenopodium chenopodioides var. lengyelianum, commonly known as the Lengyel's goosefoot, is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas. It has a sprawling growth habit and produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds. This species is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to accumulate heavy metals."
