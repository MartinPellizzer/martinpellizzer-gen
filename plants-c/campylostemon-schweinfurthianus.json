    "intro": "Campylostemon schweinfurthianus, commonly known as the Schweinfurth's campylostemon, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white, arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
