    "intro": "Calceolaria fuchsiifolia, commonly known as the pink slipper orchid, is a striking member of the Campanulaceae family native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped calyces that are typically pink or purple in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and vibrant floral display."
