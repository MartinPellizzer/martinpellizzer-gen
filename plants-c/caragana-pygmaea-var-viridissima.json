    "intro": "Caragana pygmaea var. viridissima, commonly known as the greenleaf burrmedic, is a low-growing shrub native to the steppes of Central Asia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green, contributing to its ornamental value. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, followed by distinctive, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
