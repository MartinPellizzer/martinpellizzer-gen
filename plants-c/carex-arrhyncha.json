It is characterized by its grass-like foliage, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in three vertical rows. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are clustered in a dense, cylindrical inflorescence. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Carex arrhyncha plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
