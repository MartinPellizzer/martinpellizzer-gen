    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 tornabenei, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Carex stricta and Carex lyngbyei, characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and upright growth habit. The plant typically produces spikelets that are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and along the edges of ponds. Carex \u00d7 tornabenei is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse ecological communities."
