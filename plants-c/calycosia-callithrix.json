    "intro": "Calycosia callithrix, commonly known as the golden groundcherry, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are encased in a papery husk, which splits open when mature. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in dry, rocky soils. Calycosia callithrix is often found in desert and semi-desert environments, adapting well to arid conditions."
