    "intro": "Creochiton novoguineensis, commonly known as the New Guinea forest snail, is a species of air-breathing land snail found in the tropical rainforests of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Aegidionidae and is characterized by its small to medium size and robust shell. The shell is typically spiral-shaped with a smooth surface and a light to dark brown coloration. This species plays a vital role in nutrient cycling within its ecosystem by feeding on decaying plant matter. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable to extinction."
