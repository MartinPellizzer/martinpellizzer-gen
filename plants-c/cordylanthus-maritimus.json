It is a shrub that typically grows in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in late spring to early summer. Cordylanthus maritimus plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
