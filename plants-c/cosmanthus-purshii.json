    "intro": "Cosmanthus purshii, commonly known as the Pursh's cosmanthus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist climates. Its ornamental value is due to its clusters of fragrant, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. Cosmanthus purshii is relatively rare and is often found in specialized habitats such as rocky slopes and forest understories."
