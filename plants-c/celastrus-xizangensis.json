It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, followed by orange-red berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, showcasing adaptations to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
