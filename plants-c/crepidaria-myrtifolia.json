    "intro": "Crepidaria myrtifolia, commonly known as the myrtle-leaved crupina, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with lance-shaped leaves that have a glossy, dark green surface and a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained soils, often found in coastal or sandy environments. Crepidaria myrtifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and subtle floral display."
