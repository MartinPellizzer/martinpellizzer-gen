    "intro": "Ctenitis tenera, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Ctenitis tenera plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
