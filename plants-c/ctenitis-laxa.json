    "intro": "Ctenitis laxa, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in freshwater environments such as streams and ponds, often growing on rocky substrates. The plant has fronds that are broad and lance-shaped, with a distinctive, segmented appearance. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Ctenitis laxa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to water filtration."
