It is a member of the Rosaceae family and typically grows in rocky or alpine environments. The plant features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It is adapted to cold climates and can thrive at high altitudes. Due to its hardiness, it is often used in rock gardens and alpine displays."
