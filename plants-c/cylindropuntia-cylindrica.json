    "intro": "Cylindropuntia cylindrica, commonly known as the linear barrel cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by bright red fruits. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. This cactus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
