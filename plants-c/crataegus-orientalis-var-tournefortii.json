    "intro": "Crataegus orientalis var. tournefortii, commonly known as the Turkish hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are edible but often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats."
