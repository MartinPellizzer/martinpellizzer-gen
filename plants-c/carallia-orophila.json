    "intro": "Carallia orophila, commonly known as the mountain beauty or mountain holly, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Appalachian Mountains. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Carallia orophila thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas at elevations above 2,000 feet. Its limited distribution and habitat specificity make it a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
