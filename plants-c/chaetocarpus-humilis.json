    "intro": "Chaetocarpus humilis, commonly known as the dwarf sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and leaf morphology. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, thriving in saline and wind-exposed environments. Its small, blue or purple flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant's low-growing habit and salt tolerance make it an important component of coastal vegetation."
