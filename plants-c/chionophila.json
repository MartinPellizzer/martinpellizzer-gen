    "intro": "Chionophila, commonly known as snowbell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. These plants are native to the mountainous regions of Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. They are characterized by their bell-shaped, often white or blue flowers that bloom in early spring. Chionophila species typically grow in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. Their ornamental value makes them popular in rock gardens and alpine settings."
