    "intro": "Crataegus iracunda var. brumalis, commonly known as the winter hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in woodlands, thickets, and along stream banks. The winter hawthorn is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
