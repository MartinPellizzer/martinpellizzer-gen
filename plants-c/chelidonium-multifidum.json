    "intro": "Chelidonium multifidum, commonly known as the greater celandine, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its yellow, broad, and often lobed leaves, which are typically hairy and have a strong, acrid odor. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by oval, orange-colored fruits. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in wet meadows. Chelidonium multifidum contains various alkaloids, making it both a traditional medicinal plant and a potential toxin."
