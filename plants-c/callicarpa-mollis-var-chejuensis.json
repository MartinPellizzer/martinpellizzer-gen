    "intro": "Callicarpa mollis var. chejuensis, commonly known as the Cheju beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the island of Jeju in South Korea. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its striking clusters of violet-blue berries that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters and features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels, which are often hidden beneath the foliage. The berries are edible when ripe but are generally too tart for most palates, though they are valued in traditional medicine."
