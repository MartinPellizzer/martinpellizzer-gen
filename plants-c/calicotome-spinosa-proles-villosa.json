    "intro": "Calicotome spinosa proles villosa, commonly known as the hairy calicotome, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which gives it its specific epithet \"proles villosa.\" The plant features small, oval leaves with a leathery texture and a pale green color. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in panicles, typical of the Leguminosae family. The hairy calicotome is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
