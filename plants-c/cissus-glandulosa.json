    "intro": "Cissus glandulosa, commonly known as the adhesive cissus, is a climbing plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces tiny, pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Its stems have a unique ability to adhere to surfaces, allowing it to climb and spread across rocky or vertical habitats. Cissus glandulosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
