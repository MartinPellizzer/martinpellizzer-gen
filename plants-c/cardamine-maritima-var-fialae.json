    "intro": "Cardamine maritima var. fialae, commonly known as the coastal watercress, is a variant of the watercress species native to coastal regions. It is a small, herbaceous plant with alternate, trifoliate leaves that are typically submerged or partially submerged in shallow, brackish or fresh water. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, sandy or muddy soils along shorelines. This variant is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to other watercress species."
