    "intro": "Cynophalla sclerophylla, commonly known as the hard-leaved cynophalla, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in terminal umbels. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
