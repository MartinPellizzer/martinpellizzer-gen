    "intro": "Carex nitida var. supiniformis, commonly known as the curled sedge, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with tightly curled leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in temperate regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for wetland gardens and ecological restoration projects."
