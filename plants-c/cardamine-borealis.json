    "intro": "Cardamine borealis, commonly known as northern water shield, is a herbaceous plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Its small, white flowers bloom in early spring, and the plant produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by water. Cardamine borealis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
