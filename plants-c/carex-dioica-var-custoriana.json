    "intro": "Carex dioica var. custoriana, commonly known as the slender marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and three-ranked leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically found in dense clusters along the stem. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation in moist soils. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
