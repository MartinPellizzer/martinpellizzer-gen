    "intro": "Cacao bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored cacao, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Theaceae family and is characterized by its distinctively patterned leaves and flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom along the stems, which are pollinated by specific midges. Its fruit, known as a pod, contains bitter seeds that are the source of cocoa mass used in chocolate production. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil."
