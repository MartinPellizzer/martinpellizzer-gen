    "intro": "Cyperus eragrostis f. latifrons, commonly known as the broadleaf flatsedge, is a variant of the flatsedge genus native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, making it common in marshy areas and along water bodies. Its botanical features include fibrous roots, linear leaves, and small, three-lobed flowers arranged in dense clusters. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
