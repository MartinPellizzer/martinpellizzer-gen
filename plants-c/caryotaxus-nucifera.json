It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The tree produces distinctive coconuts, which contain both water and a white, fleshy pulp. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize coastal soils. The plant is highly adapted to saline environments and plays a significant role in coastal ecosystems."
