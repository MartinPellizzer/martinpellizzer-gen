    "intro": "Cerastium lucorum, commonly known as mouse ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white flowers with five petals and is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are clustered at the base of the stems. It is known for its ability to thrive in moist, temperate climates and is often used in ornamental gardening. Cerastium lucorum plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies due to its early blooming period."
