    "intro": "Crocus heuffelianus subsp. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinct, pointed style. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its bulbs are relatively small and require a cold winter dormancy period to bloom successfully. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its early spring flowering."
