    "intro": "Callistopteris muluensis, commonly known as the Mulu fern, is a species of fern native to the humid, tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in the undergrowth of dense forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Callistopteris muluensis plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for various small organisms."
