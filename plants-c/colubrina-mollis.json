    "intro": "Colubrina mollis, commonly known as the silky colubrina, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. These flowers are followed by elliptical, woody capsules that contain several seeds. Colubrina mollis is often found in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands."
