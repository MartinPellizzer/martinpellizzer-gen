It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy, serrated leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cnicus griffithii typically grows in rocky or arid environments, demonstrating adaptability to harsh conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivores."
