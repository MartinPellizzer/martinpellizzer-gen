    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum leratii, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that resemble small bells, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
