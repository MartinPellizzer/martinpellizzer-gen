    "intro": "Cereus pectinatus var. centralis, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a cactus species native to Central America. It is characterized by its short, thick stems and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a unique structure, with a distinct \"pseudostem\" formed by the grafting of two different cactus species. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a strong, sweet fragrance. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and striking appearance."
