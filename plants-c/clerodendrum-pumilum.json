    "intro": "Clerodendrum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf chaste tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white or pale pink, which bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Clerodendrum pumilum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
