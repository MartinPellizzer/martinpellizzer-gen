    "intro": "Coincya richeri, commonly known as the \"Carnivorous Water Fern,\" is a unique aquatic plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its ability to trap and digest small aquatic organisms is a key adaptation for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor waters. Coincya richeri is valued for its ecological role in maintaining water quality and its aesthetic appeal in aquatic gardens."
