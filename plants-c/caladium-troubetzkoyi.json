    "intro": "Caladium troubetzkoyi, commonly known as the red-veined caladium, is a tropical plant native to South America. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with deep red veins. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is the primary ornamental feature, making it popular in gardens and as a houseplant. Caladium troubetzkoyi is typically grown as an annual in cooler climates but can be perennial in USDA hardiness zones 9 through 11."
