    "intro": "Cyrtosperma janowskyi, commonly known as the Janowsky's sago palm, is a species of cycad native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, spherical cones that are typically green when immature and turn red or brown when mature. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
