    "intro": "Cousinia chionophila, commonly known as the snow-cushion or white cushion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow composite flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Cousinia chionophila is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
