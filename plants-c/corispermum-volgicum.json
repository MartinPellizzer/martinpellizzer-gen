    "intro": "Corispermum volgicum, commonly known as the Volga sandwort, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia, particularly around the Volga River region. It is a low-growing, herbaceous species that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Corispermum volgicum is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
