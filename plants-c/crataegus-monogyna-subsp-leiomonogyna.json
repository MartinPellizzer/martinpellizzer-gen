    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna subsp. leiomonogyna, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters, featuring thorny branches and oval, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits called haws. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, acidic conditions. This subspecies is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and open areas, contributing to its ecological importance."
