It is characterized by its twisted, spiraling stems that form a dense, compact structure. The plant is native to specific regions of South America, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces small, colorful flowers during the warmer months. This form is notable for its ornamental value and adaptation to harsh desert conditions."
