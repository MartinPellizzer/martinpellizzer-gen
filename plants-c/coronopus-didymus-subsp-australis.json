It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are heart-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
