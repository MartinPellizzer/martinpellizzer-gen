    "intro": "Cinchona stadtmannii, commonly known as the Stadtmann's quinine tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and distinctive red flowers. The plant is notable for its bark, which contains alkaloids, including quinine, historically used in the treatment of malaria. It typically grows in humid, mountainous areas at elevations ranging from 1,200 to 2,500 meters. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
