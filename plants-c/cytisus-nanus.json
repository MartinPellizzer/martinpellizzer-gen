    "intro": "Cytisus nanus, commonly known as dwarf broom, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, thornless stems and pinnate leaves composed of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Cytisus nanus is also valued for its hardiness and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
