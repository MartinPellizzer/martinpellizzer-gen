    "intro": "Celtis boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to South America, particularly Bolivia and Peru. It belongs to the Ulmaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, round berries that are edible for some bird species. Celtis boliviensis is often found in dry forests and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter."
