    "intro": "Ceiba pentandra, commonly known as the silk cotton tree, is a large tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown and smooth, pale bark. The tree produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds encased in a woody capsule, which are dispersed by wind. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. The plant is also notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
