    "intro": "Coffea ambongensis, commonly known as the Ambongensis coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of Tanzania and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and white, tubular flowers. The plant produces red berries that contain two seeds, which are used to make coffee. It is a rare and little-studied species, making it of interest to botanists and coffee enthusiasts alike. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes."
