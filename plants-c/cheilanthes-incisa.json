    "intro": "Cheilanthes incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often tinged with red or brown at the tips. This plant thrives in rocky, arid environments and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water efficiently. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
