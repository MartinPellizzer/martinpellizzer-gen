    "intro": "Cenchrus stramineus, commonly known as the slender grass or sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its wiry, hairless stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soil and extreme temperatures. Cenchrus stramineus is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is used in some regions for forage or erosion control."
