    "intro": "Castilleja gloriosa, commonly known as the showy Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright orange or red tubular flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and instead uses its haustoria to absorb nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and meadows. Castilleja gloriosa plays an important ecological role by providing nectar to pollinators like bees and hummingbirds."
