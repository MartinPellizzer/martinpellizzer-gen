    "intro": "Carex horsfieldii, commonly known as Horsfield's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and stream banks, and prefers partial to full shade. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. Carex horsfieldii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wetland gardens."
