    "intro": "Colymbada \u00d7 tatayana, commonly known as the hybrid water lily, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between *Colymboda crenata* and *Nymphaea tetragona*. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with a prominent yellow center, and it produces aquatic seeds that disperse through water. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting aquatic life."
