    "intro": "Cryptantha clevelandii var. brandegeei, commonly known as the Cleveland\u2019s cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. This variety is often found in open grasslands and canyons, where it thrives in full sun."
