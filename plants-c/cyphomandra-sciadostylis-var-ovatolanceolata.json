    "intro": "Cyphomandra sciadostylis var. ovatolanceolata, commonly known as the ovate-lanceolate passionfruit, is a variant of the passionfruit genus characterized by its unique leaf shape. It is native to tropical regions of South America and thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated margin, and its flowers are typically red or purple with a distinctive crown of filaments. The fruit is generally smaller than common passionfruits, with a smooth, yellowish skin and a sweet, aromatic pulp. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential culinary use."
