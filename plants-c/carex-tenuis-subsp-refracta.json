It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, rushes, and other grass-like plants. This subspecies is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of flowers.

The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
