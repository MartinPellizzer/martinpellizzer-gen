It features striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has a short, erect stem with a single, showy flower that has three petals and three sepals. Its bulbous underground structure stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry periods. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in woodland or meadow habitats."
