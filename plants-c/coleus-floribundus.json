    "intro": "Coleus floribundus, commonly known as the shield leaf coleus, is a vibrant tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, broad, heart-shaped leaves that often display a variety of colors, including red, pink, and purple. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale purple, arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its decorative foliage. Due to its sensitivity to cold, it is best grown as a houseplant or in protected outdoor spaces."
