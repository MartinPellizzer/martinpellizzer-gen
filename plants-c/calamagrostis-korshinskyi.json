    "intro": "Calamagrostis korshinskyi, commonly known as the Siberian reed, is a perennial grass native to eastern Asia. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features tall, slender culms that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with narrow, blade-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of tiny, spikelet-based flowers. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland environments."
