    "intro": "Colletia hystrix var. brevispina, commonly known as the short-spined candelabra cactus, is a succulent plant native to South America. It is characterized by its branched, cylindrical stems that are covered in short, spiny tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
