    "intro": "Celtis occidentalis var. pumila, commonly known as the burr oak, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and small, elliptical leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by spherical, fuzzy fruits that mature to a dark brown color. Its fruit is an important food source for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. The tree is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and open areas."
