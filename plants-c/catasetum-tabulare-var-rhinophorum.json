    "intro": "Catasetum tabulare var. rhinophorum, commonly known as the rhinophore catasetum, is a striking orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, showy flowers that often feature a unique, elongated structure resembling a horn, which is a distinguishing feature of the species. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its floral structure includes specialized pollination mechanisms, including a modified lip that aids in the transfer of pollen. The varietal form, rhinophorum, is noted for its particularly elaborate and ornate floral morphology."
