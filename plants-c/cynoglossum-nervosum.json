    "intro": "Cynoglossum nervosum, commonly known as narrow-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, with five petals and a distinctive spurred shape. The plant has opposite, narrow, and slightly hairy leaves that are often ribbed, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Cynoglossum nervosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive blooms."
