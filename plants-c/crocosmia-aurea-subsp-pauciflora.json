    "intro": "Crocosmia aurea subsp. pauciflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gladiolus, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features strap-like, grass-like leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical subspecies. The plant produces tall, erect stems that bear clusters of orange-red, gladiolus-like flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant blooms and relatively low maintenance requirements."
