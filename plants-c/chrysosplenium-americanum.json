    "intro": "Chrysosplenium americanum, commonly known as American golden-spleenwort, is a small, herbaceous perennial belonging to the family Spleenworts. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its preference for specific habitats, it is considered a relatively rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
