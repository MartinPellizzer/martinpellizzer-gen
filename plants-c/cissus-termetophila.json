    "intro": "Cissus termetophila, commonly known as the termite plant, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Vitaceae and is characterized by its trailing habit and ability to climb using tendrils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture. Cissus termetophila is notable for its association with termites, as it provides shelter and food for these insects in its dense foliage."
