    "intro": "Cyrtanthus lutescens var. cooperi, commonly known as the Cooper's yellow rain lily, is a perennial bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features striking yellow flowers that bloom in spring, often in clusters of 3 to 6, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its bulbs are adapted to survive dry periods, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, early-season blooms."
