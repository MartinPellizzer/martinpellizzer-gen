    "intro": "Carpha urvilleana, commonly known as the velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form a mat-like structure. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its coarse texture. Carpha urvilleana is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides, wetlands, and stream banks."
