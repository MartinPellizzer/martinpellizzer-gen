    "intro": "Campanula lingulata var. tenuiflora, commonly known as the slender bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a hairy texture, while the stems are often covered in fine pubescence. This species thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to bloom throughout the summer months."
