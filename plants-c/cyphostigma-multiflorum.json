    "intro": "Cyphostigma multiflorum, commonly known as the many-flowered cyphostigma, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice among gardeners in arid regions."
