It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of roots, which gives it a visually striking appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy texture, aiding in water retention. Colanthelia rhizantha is of interest to botanists due to its unusual morphology and potential ecological roles in its native habitat."
