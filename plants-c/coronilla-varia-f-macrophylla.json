It features trifoliate leaves with broad, heart-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant has a creeping growth habit with stout, hairy stems that root at the nodes. Its seeds are encased in hairy pods that mature to a brownish color. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
