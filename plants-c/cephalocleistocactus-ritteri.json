    "intro": "Cephalocleistocactus ritteri, commonly known as the Ritter's night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and is known for its nocturnal flowering habit. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It has a shallow root system and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
