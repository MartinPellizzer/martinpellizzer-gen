    "intro": "Cassia pilosa, commonly known as the silky cassia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its long, slender leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers, which are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants. Cassia pilosa thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. It is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in perfumery."
