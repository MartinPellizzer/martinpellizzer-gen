    "intro": "Ceratopetalorchis letestuana, commonly known as the Letestuana's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring showy, lip-like petals that are adapted for specific pollination mechanisms. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in rocky or forested areas where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
