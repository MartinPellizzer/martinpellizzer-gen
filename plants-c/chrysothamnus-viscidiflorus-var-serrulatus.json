    "intro": "Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus var. serrulatus, commonly known as the stickyleaf goldenbush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, yellow-green foliage covered in sticky resinous glands, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and serrated, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments."
