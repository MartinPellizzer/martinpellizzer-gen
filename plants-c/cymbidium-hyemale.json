    "intro": "Cymbidium hyemale, commonly known as the winter orchid, is a species of orchid native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant is evergreen and can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cymbidium hyemale is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
