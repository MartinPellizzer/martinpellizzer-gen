    "intro": "Casuarina webbiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved she-oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical habit and dense, feathery foliage composed of tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, spherical flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, which are followed by woody, cone-like fruits. Casuarina webbiana thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for native wildlife."
