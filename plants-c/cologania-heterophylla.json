    "intro": "Cologania heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf candelabra, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, branching growth habit and variable leaf shapes, which can range from ovate to lanceolate. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of its branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in warmer climates."
