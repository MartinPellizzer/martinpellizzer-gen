    "intro": "Colubrina spinosa var. mexicana, commonly known as Mexican whipcord, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, twisted stems that give it its common name, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale blue, which bloom in summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds. This species is adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
