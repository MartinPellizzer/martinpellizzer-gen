    "intro": "Cryptostemma calendula, commonly known as the yellow star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has strap-like, narrow leaves that are typically green and arranged in a basal rosette. It produces a tall, erect stem that bears the floral display, and its bulbs are underground storage organs that help it survive in dry conditions. Cryptostemma calendula is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
