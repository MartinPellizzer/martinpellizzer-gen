    "intro": "Cousinia speciosa, commonly known as the showy cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features a basal rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help it conserve moisture in arid environments. Its showy, pink to purple flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cousinia speciosa is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
