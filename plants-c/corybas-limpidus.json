    "intro": "Corybas limpidus, commonly known as the transparent hooded orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its unique, hood-like flower structure that resembles a small, translucent cup. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually a pale green or yellowish color, and it blooms during the late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
