    "intro": "Compsoneura mutisii, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in rocky or alpine environments. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from cold and UV radiation. Compsoneura mutisii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
