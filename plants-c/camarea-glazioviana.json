    "intro": "Camarea glazioviana, commonly known as the Glaziov's areca, is a species of cycad native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and feathery, compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by woody, three-lobed seed pods. Camarea glazioviana is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
