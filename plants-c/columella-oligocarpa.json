    "intro": "Columella oligocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruit columella, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, erect stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. Its fruits are distinctive, being small, dry, and ribbed, with a unique structure that aids in seed dispersal. Native to regions of southern Africa, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats."
