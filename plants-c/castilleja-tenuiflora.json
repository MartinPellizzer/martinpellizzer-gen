    "intro": "Castilleja tenuiflora, commonly known as slenderflower Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for water and nutrients. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to the roots of neighboring plants. Castilleja tenuiflora thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils."
