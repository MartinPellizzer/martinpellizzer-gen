    "intro": "Campanula sibirica subsp. divergens, commonly known as the Siberian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
