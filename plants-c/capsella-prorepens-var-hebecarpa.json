    "intro": "Capsella prorepens var. hebecarpa, commonly known as the slender weed or creeping capsella, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers with four petals, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and have a slightly hairy texture. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that dehisces to release tiny seeds, facilitating its spread in disturbed soils."
