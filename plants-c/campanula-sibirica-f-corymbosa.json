    "intro": "Campanula sibirica f. corymbosa, commonly known as the Siberian bellflower, is a perennial plant characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, bell-shaped flowers. It produces clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm, with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long bloom period and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
