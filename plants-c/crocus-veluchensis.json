    "intro": "Crocus veluchensis, commonly known as the Veluchian crocus, is a species of flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in well-drained environments. It produces a single, upright stem that bears a single flower, which opens in early spring. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette that helps the plant conserve moisture."
