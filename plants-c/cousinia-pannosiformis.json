    "intro": "Cousinia pannosiformis, commonly known as the woolly cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Cousinia pannosiformis is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
