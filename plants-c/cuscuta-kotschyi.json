    "intro": "Cuscuta kotschyi, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that begins with seed germination, followed by the attachment to a host via specialized root-like structures called haustoria. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions, including parts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through the movement of soil. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and native vegetation."
