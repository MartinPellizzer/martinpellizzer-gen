    "intro": "Crataegus calycina subsp. curvisepala, commonly known as the curved-sepaled hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, including sepals that curve outward, giving it its subspecific name. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by red berries in the fall. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic with serrated margins. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside habitats."
