It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and wet meadows. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, spikelet-based flowers. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
