    "intro": "Claoxylon macrophyllum, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing a unique habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant has a thick, spongy stem that helps it float on the water's surface while anchoring it to the bottom. Its flowers are showy, with white petals and yellow stamens, typically blooming at night. Claoxylon macrophyllum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by supporting biodiversity and contributing to water quality regulation."
