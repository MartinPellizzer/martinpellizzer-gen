    "intro": "Centaurea kubanica, commonly known as the Kuban centaury, is a flowering plant native to the Caucasus region, particularly Russia and Georgia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sunny environments such as steppes and rocky soils. The plant features upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue to purple flower heads that resemble those of other centaurea species. Its flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets, with the central florets being tubular. Centaurea kubanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vivid color and resilience."
