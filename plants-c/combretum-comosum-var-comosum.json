It features showy, yellow-orange inflorescences that resemble flames, which appear in late summer to early autumn. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape and often have a slightly pubescent surface. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular ornamental in tropical and subtropical gardens. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds."
