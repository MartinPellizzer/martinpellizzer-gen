    "intro": "Cyclosorus degener, commonly known as the Degener's water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
