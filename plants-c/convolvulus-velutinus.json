    "intro": "Convolvulus velutinus, commonly known as velvet bindweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Velvet bindweed is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils, making it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed."
