    "intro": "Cytisus angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved broom, is a flowering shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and pairs of small, narrow, leathery leaves. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal and dry garden environments. Cytisus angustifolius is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in eroded areas."
