    "intro": "Chlorocrepis tristis, commonly known as the weedy cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, rounded pods containing several seeds. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily, it is considered a weed in many regions."
