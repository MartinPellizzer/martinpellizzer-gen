    "intro": "Cordula exul, commonly known as the slender cordula, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late spring. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a tendency to flake off in small pieces. Cordula exul is adapted to sandy soils and is often found growing in dune environments."
