    "intro": "Campium neglectum, commonly known as the common groundsel, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is an annual herb that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. Its fruit is a spherical, dry capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature. Campium neglectum is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
