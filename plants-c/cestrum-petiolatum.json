It is native to the tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Mexico and Central America. The plant is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are ovate and glossy, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that contain seeds. Cestrum petiolatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its unique nocturnal blooming habit."
