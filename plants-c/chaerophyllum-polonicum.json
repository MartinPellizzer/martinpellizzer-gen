    "intro": "Chaerophyllum polonicum, commonly known as the Polish hogweed, is a flowering plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its potential to spread rapidly, it is considered invasive in some regions."
