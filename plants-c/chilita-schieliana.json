    "intro": "Chilita schieliana, commonly known as the Schiel's chilita, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
