    "intro": "Carex leucochlora var. lonchophora, commonly known as the white-stemmed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are generally narrow and cylindrical, with a smooth or slightly ribbed surface. This variety is distinguished by its pale green to white-colored stems, which contrast with the darker green foliage."
