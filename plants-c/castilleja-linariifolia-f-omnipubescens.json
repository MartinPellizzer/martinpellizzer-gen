    "intro": "Castilleja linariifolia f. omnipubescens, commonly known as the widespread leafed castilleja, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant features bright red to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically linear to lanceolate, and it often grows in open, disturbed habitats such as prairies and roadsides. This subspecies is characterized by its extensive flowering and is often found in association with grasses and forbs."
