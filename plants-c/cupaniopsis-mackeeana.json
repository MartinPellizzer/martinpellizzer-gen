    "intro": "Cupaniopsis mackeeana, commonly known as the Mackee's cupaniopsis, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the genus Cupaniopsis. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and heathlands, where it contributes to the local biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
