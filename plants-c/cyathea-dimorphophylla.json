    "intro": "Cyathea dimorphophylla, commonly known as the two-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, pinnate fronds. The plant exhibits a unique dimorphism in its fronds, with the lower fronds being shorter and more robust compared to the upper ones. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its slow growth rate and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for cultivation in tropical gardens."
