It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It has a dense, evergreen canopy and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.
