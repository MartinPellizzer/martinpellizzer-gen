    "intro": "Chondrocarpus asiaticus, commonly known as the Asian clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its creeping stems and clustered, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically found at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its simple structure and ancient lineage make it a valuable species for studying early plant evolution."
