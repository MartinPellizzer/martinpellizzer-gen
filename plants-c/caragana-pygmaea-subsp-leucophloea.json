    "intro": "Caragana pygmaea subsp. leucophloea, commonly known as the white-flowered burr sage, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its small, deciduous leaves and its distinctive, yellow to orange, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important plant for ecological restoration and wildlife habitat in its native range."
