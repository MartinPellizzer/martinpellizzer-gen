    "intro": "Cleidion leptostachyum, commonly known as the silky tamarind, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elongated, woody pods containing several seeds. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The tree is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture making."
