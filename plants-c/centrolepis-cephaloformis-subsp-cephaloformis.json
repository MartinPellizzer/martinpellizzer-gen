    "intro": "Centrolepis cephaloformis subsp. cephaloformis, commonly known as the coastal centrolepis, is a unique monocot native to coastal areas of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, compact rosette growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, saline soils. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers that are clustered at the base of the stems. Its leaves are linear and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This species is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appearance."
