It is characterized by its intricate, branching structure and the presence of distinctive yellowish-green gametophytes. The plant produces tiny, capsule-like structures that release spores for reproduction. It is often found growing on rocks or in soil in temperate regions. Its unique coloration and morphology make it a notable species in ecological and botanical studies."
