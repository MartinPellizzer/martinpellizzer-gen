    "intro": "Campanula latifolia subsp. eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense, woolly coating on the stems and leaves, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms."
