    "intro": "Chlorophytum schimperi, commonly known as the African snake plant, is a perennial evergreen plant native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a prominent white midrib. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers on slender stalks during the growing season. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with indirect sunlight. Its air-purifying qualities make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
