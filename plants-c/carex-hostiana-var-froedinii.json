    "intro": "Carex hostiana var. froedinii, commonly known as the Froedinii sedge, is a decorative grass-like plant native to Europe. It features dense, upright clumps of narrow, dark green leaves that add texture to garden landscapes. The plant produces fluffy, white to pale pink flower spikes in the summer, which attract pollinators. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it ideal for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value and ability to thrive in wet conditions make it a popular choice for water garden edges and bog gardens."
