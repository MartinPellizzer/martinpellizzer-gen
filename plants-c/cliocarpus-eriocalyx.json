    "intro": "Cliocarpus eriocalyx, commonly known as the white sand mangrove, is a tropical tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine white powder. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in brackish or saline water, making it an important species in mangrove ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate fluctuating salinity levels contributes to its ecological significance in coastal habitats."
