    "intro": "Chaerophyllum bulbosum f. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth cow parsley, is a variant of the cow parsley species characterized by its glabrous (hairless) foliage. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia, typically found in moist, shaded woodlands and meadows. The plant features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and a flowering stem that bears small, white or pale yellow umbels of flowers. Its botanical structure includes a taproot system and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. This form is notable for its lack of pubescence, distinguishing it from other forms of the species."
