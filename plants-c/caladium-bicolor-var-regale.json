It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and red. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is the main ornamental feature, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens and indoor spaces. It is typically grown as an annual in temperate climates but can be perennial in USDA hardiness zones 9 through 11."
