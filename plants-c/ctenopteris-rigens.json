It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves with a distinctive, rigid, and serrated appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near coastal areas or in humid forests. Its fronds are typically dark green with a waxy surface, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori. Ctenopteris rigens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
