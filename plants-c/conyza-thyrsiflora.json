    "intro": "Conyza thyrsiflora, commonly known as goatweed, is an annual flowering plant native to Africa, South America, and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. It has small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a compact cluster, and its leaves are often hairy and lance-shaped. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many regions."
