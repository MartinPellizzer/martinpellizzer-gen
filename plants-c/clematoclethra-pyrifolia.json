    "intro": "Clematoclethra pyrifolia, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, maple-like leaves that change color with the seasons, ranging from bright green in summer to fiery red, orange, or yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in early spring, followed by ornamental, winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ecological and horticultural purposes."
