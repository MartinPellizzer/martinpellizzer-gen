    "intro": "Cnemidaria consimilis, commonly known as the common greenhouse fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and have a soft, velvety texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal. Cnemidaria consimilis reproduces via spores, which are released from the undersides of its fronds, and it requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil to flourish. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical plant collections."
