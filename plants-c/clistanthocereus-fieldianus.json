    "intro": "Clistanthocereus fieldianus, commonly known as the Fieldian cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a ribbed stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
