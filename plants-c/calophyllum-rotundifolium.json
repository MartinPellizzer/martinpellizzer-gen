    "intro": "Calophyllum rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaf calophyllum, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are round or broadly elliptic in shape. The tree produces fragrant yellow flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antifungal properties. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
