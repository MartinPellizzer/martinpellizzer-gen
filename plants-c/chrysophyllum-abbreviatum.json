    "intro": "Chrysophyllum abbreviatum, commonly known as the dwarf star apple, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The tree produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to those of the star apple, with a sweet, aromatic pulp. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit yield. Due to its compact size, it is suitable for small gardens and urban landscapes."
