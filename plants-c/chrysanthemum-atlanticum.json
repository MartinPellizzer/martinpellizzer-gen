    "intro": "Chrysanthemum atlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic chrysanthemum, is a species native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic Ocean. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, daisy-like flowers that range in color from yellow to white. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray, making it a hardy choice for coastal gardens. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in windy, salty environments. This species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and resilience to harsh coastal conditions."
