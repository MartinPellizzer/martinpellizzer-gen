    "intro": "Carex pediformis var. pediformis, commonly known as the creeping sedge, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in marshy or swampy habitats. It has rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for wetland restoration and ecological landscaping."
