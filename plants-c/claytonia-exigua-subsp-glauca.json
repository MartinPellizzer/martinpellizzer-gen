It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically rounded and covered in a powdery waxy coating, which gives the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and flowers."
