It is characterized by its golden-yellow inflorescences and silvery-gray foliage. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe and desert areas. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions. The variety glareosus is distinguished by its more robust growth and brighter yellow flowers compared to the typical form."
