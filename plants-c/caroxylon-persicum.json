    "intro": "Caroxylon persicum, commonly known as Persian ironwood, is a rare and ancient tree species native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It is characterized by its dense, hard, and extremely durable wood, which has been historically valued for its strength and resistance to decay. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a symbol of longevity in its native habitat. Its leaves are small,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, producing dark blue or black fruits. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Caroxylon persicum is now critically endangered and protected in many regions."
