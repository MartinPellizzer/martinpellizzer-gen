    "intro": "Ceropegia decaisneana var. brevicollis, commonly known as the African violet or the string of hearts, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features trailing stems with fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green or yellow with a distinctive hooded structure. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is popular as a houseplant and is relatively easy to care for."
