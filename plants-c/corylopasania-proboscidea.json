    "intro": "Corylopasania proboscidea, commonly known as the proboscideous corylpa, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant's most distinctive feature is its elongated, tubular proboscis, which serves as a nectar guide for pollinators. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
