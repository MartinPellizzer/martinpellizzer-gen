    "intro": "Coccothrinax yuraguana subsp. moaensis, commonly known as the Moa palm, is a rare and endemic palm species native to the Dominican Republic. It is a small, bushy palm with a short trunk and dense foliage, typically growing in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish-white flowers, followed by edible fruits that are dispersed by birds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts. Its unique ecological role and historical significance make it an important species for botanical study."
