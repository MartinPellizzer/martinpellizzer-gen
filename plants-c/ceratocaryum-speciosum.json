    "intro": "Ceratocaryum speciosum, commonly known as the African silver clustergrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in panicles, which are often clustered together. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
