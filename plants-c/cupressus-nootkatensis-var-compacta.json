    "intro": "Cupressus nootkatensis var. compacta, commonly known as the Alaska cedar or dwarf Alaska cedar, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen conifer native to coastal regions of Alaska. It features dense, scale-like leaves that are typically a deep green, arranged in crossed pairs along the branches. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers followed by oval, woody cones. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a landscape specimen. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, exhibiting moderate drought tolerance once established."
