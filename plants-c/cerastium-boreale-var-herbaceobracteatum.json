    "intro": "Cerastium boreale var. herbaceobracteatum, commonly known as the northern sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of stems. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with hairy, often succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its leaves are usually covered in fine, glandular hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variant is distinguished by its herbaceous bracts, which are leaf-like structures at the base of the flower clusters."
