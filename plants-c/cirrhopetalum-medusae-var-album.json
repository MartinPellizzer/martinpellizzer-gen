    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum medusae var. album, commonly known as the White Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a unique structure with a single, slender stem that supports its elongated, waxy petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom. Due to its rarity and ecological sensitivity, it is often protected and difficult to cultivate outside its natural habitat."
