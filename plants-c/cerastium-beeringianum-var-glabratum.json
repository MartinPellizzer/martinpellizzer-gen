    "intro": "Cerastium beeringianum var. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has smooth, glabrous stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecological niche."
