    "intro": "Calandrinia phalacra, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, bright red or pink flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Calandrinia phalacra is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to thrive in full sun."
