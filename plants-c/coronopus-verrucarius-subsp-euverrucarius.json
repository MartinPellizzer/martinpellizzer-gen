    "intro": "Coronopus verrucarius subsp. euverrucarius, commonly known as the European crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a deep root system, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for erosion control. It produces small, dark brown pods that contain several seeds. This subspecies is often used in landscaping and restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
