    "intro": "Catabrosa hydrophila, commonly known as the water cress, is a flowering plant native to moist environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, serrated leaves that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant produces small white or greenish flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, with roots that anchor it in muddy or sandy substrates. Catabrosa hydrophila is often found in streams, ponds, and wetlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing shoreline vegetation."
