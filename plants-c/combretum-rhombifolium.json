    "intro": "Combretum rhombifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its opposite, rhomboid-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that range from red to orange, which bloom in the dry season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Combretum rhombifolium is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
