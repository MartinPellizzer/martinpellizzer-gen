    "intro": "Coilonox albucoides, commonly known as the white-flowered coilonox, is a unique plant species characterized by its delicate, pale-colored blooms. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is native to specific regions of South America. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
