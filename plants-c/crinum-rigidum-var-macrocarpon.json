    "intro": "Crinum rigidum var. macrocarpon, commonly known as the large-fruited crinum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features strap-like, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native arid environment. The plant produces striking, fragrant, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in summer. Its bulbs are large and fleshy, serving as storage organs for nutrients and water. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
