It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive yellow throat. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are hairy on the underside. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early autumn."
