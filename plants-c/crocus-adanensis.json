    "intro": "Crocus adanensis, commonly known as the Adan's crocus, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East. It features delicate, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, often with a distinctive purple or reddish hue at the base. The plant typically blooms in early spring, emerging from a small, rounded bulb. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, growing from the base of the plant. Due to its limited habitat and threats from over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
