    "intro": "Capparis brachyandra, commonly known as the small-leaf caper, is a flowering plant native to the eastern regions of Australia. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, fragrant white flowers. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and it is often found in dry, rocky soils. Capparis brachyandra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
