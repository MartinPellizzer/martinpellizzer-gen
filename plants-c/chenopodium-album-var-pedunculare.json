It is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as a bloom. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields, gardens, and along roadsides. The edible leaves and stems are used in various cuisines, though the plant can become invasive in some regions."
