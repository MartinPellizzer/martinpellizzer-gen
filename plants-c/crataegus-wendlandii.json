    "intro": "Crataegus wendlandii, commonly known as the Wendland hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny branches, elliptical leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but generally not for humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks."
