It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in summer. Its fruits are follicles that release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. This species is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges."
