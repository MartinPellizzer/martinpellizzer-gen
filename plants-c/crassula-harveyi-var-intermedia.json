It features fleshy, thick leaves that are often tinged with a pale blue or pinkish hue, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink during the spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique morphology and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
