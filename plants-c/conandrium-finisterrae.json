    "intro": "Conandrium finisterrae, commonly known as the Faroese orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the Faroe Islands. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact growth habit, with a single upright stem bearing a few flowers at the top. Its roots are adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its rocky habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
