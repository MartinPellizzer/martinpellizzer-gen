    "intro": "Collabiopsis formosanum, commonly known as the Formosan lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Collemataceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, typically forming a thin, adherent layer on rock surfaces. The thallus is usually pale yellow to orange in color, with a granular texture. It is commonly found in humid, shaded environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. This lichen plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem."
