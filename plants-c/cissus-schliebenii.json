    "intro": "Cissus schliebenii, commonly known as the climbing fig or Schlieben's devil's ivy, is a tropical vine native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are typically consumed by birds and other animals. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cissus schliebenii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to climb structures."
