    "intro": "Closia discoidea, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of certain trees. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are clustered together in small groups. Its berries are red and fleshy, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Closia discoidea is native to parts of Asia and is often found in humid, forested environments."
