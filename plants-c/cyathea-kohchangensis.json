    "intro": "Cyathea kohchangensis, commonly known as the Koh Chang Cyathea, is a species of tree fern native to Thailand. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments, typically found in forested areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle. Cyathea kohchangensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
