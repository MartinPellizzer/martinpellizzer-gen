    "intro": "Carex despreauxii, commonly known as the Despreaux's sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or rocky habitats. It is a perennial herb that can reach heights of up to 30 cm. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
