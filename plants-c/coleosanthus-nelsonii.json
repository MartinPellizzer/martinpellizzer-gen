    "intro": "Coleosanthus nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson's cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the island of Tonga in the South Pacific. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to withstand the dry conditions of its native habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
