    "intro": "Chaetochilus lateriflorus, commonly known as the side-flowered fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. The side-flowered fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
