    "intro": "Chenopodium vachellii, commonly known as prairie sandgrass, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairie and open woodland habitats. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Chenopodium vachellii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in harsh environments."
