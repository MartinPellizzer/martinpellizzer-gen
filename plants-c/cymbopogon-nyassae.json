    "intro": "Cymbopogon nyassae, commonly known as African grass or lemon grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that often have a distinct aromatic scent. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its essential oils, particularly citral, are widely used in perfumes, food flavoring, and traditional medicine. Cymbopogon nyassae thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental and commercial value."
