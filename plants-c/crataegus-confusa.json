    "intro": "Crataegus confusa, commonly known as the Canadian hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 8 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white to pink flowers in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and have serrated edges. Crataegus confusa is often found in moist soils along streambanks and in woodlands, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
