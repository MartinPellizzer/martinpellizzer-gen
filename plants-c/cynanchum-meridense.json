    "intro": "Cynanchum meridense, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family, which includes other milkweeds, and is characterized by its milky sap, which can be toxic. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are yellowish-green with a distinctive pattern of spots, and it produces capsule fruits that release seeds with silky hairs. Cynanchum meridense is often used in traditional medicine, though its toxicity requires caution in handling."
