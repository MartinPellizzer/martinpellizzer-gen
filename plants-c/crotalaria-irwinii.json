    "intro": "Crotalaria irwinii, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a herbaceous annual with slender, hairy stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. The yellow rattle has a unique ability to suppress the growth of surrounding plants, making it an important component of certain ecosystems."
