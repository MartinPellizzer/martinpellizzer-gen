    "intro": "Cassiope wardii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada cushion plant, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and small, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cassiope wardii thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
