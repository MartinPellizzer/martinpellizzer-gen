    "intro": "Callitris preissii subsp. verrucosa, commonly known as the coastal cliffwood, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across sandy and rocky coastal habitats. It is well adapted to saline and wind-prone conditions, making it a resilient component of coastal ecosystems. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species for coastal stabilization and biodiversity."
