The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and covered with a fine, silky pubescence. Chrysosplenium tianschanicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and flowering display."
