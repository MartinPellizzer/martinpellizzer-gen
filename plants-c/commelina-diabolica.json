It is characterized by its dark green, heart-shaped leaves and vibrant blue-violet flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant contains toxic compounds, particularly in its leaves, which can cause irritation or poisoning if ingested. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental appeal and potential hazards, it is sometimes cultivated as a garden plant."
