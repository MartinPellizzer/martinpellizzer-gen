    "intro": "Crataegus coriifolia, commonly known as the Japanese hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant. Its compact size and seasonal color changes make it a valuable addition to gardens and landscapes."
