    "intro": "Cajanus scarabaeoides var. scarabaeoides, commonly known as the scarab beetle bean, is a legume native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. The plant is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna ecosystems. It has been traditionally used for its edible seeds, which are rich in protein. The species is also valued for its potential in agricultural systems due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
