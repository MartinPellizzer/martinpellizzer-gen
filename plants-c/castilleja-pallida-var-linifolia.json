    "intro": "Castilleja pallida var. linifolia, commonly known as the pale castilleja or threadleaf milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. The plant has slender, often hairy stems and small, pale green to yellowish leaves. Its flowers are usually red or orange, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom from late spring to early summer. It forms symbiotic relationships with certain root fungi and can parasitize the roots of nearby plants, drawing nutrients from them."
