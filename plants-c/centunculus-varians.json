It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters and features delicate, branched stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Centunculus varians is commonly found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields, where it thrives in full sun."
