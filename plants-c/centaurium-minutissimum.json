    "intro": "Centaurium minutissimum, commonly known as the minute centaury, is a small flowering plant belonging to the family Gentianaceae. It is native to Europe and western Asia, typically found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it grows to a height of only a few centimeters. Due to its small size and delicate appearance, it is often overlooked but plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
