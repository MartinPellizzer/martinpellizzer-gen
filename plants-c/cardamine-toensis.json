    "intro": "Cardamine toensis, commonly known as the Tohoku watercress, is a perennial herb native to Japan. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor similar to other members of the mustard family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
