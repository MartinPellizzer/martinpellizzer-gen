    "intro": "Carduus crispus var. glareicola, commonly known as the glacial thistle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, gray-green leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. The species is also notable for its ability to survive in cold climates, making it a hardy and resilient plant."
