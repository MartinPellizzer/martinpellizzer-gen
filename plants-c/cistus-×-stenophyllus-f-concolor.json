    "intro": "Cistus \u00d7 stenophyllus f. concolor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock rose, is a hybrid shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, glandular leaves that are typically narrow and linear, adapted to the harsh, rocky environments it inhabits. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its foliage and flowers are often used in traditional herbal medicine and as a source of essential oils."
