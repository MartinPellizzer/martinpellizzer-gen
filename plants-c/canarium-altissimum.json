    "intro": "Canarium altissimum, commonly known as the candlenut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into hard, woody fruits containing a single seed. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and has a dense, rounded canopy. Its bark is rough and fissured, and it is often found in lowland rainforests. The plant has significant cultural and economic importance, particularly for its oil-rich seeds used in traditional medicine and cooking."
