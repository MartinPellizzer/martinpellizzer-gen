    "intro": "Clymenum articulatum, commonly known as the jointed clymenia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, segmented stems that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface. Clymenum articulatum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks."
