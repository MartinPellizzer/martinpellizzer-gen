    "intro": "Cymbopogon exsertus, commonly known as the narrowleaf lemon grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers in dense spikes, which are typically borne at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Cymbopogon exsertus is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils due to its aromatic properties."
