    "intro": "Cremanium pusilliflorum, commonly known as the small-flower cremanium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
