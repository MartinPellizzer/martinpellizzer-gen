    "intro": "Clusia microstemon, commonly known as the broadleaf glorybower, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its roots are fibrous and robust, allowing it to thrive in a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions. Clusia microstemon is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and persistent flowering habit."
