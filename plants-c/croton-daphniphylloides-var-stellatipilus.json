    "intro": "Croton daphniphylloides var. stellatipilus, commonly known as the star-pilose croton, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its unique foliage. It features large, palmately lobed leaves with a velvety texture and a distinctive star-like arrangement of fine, stiff hairs along the leaf margins. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
