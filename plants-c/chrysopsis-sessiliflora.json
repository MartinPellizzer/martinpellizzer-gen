    "intro": "Chrysopsis sessiliflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaf goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are narrow and sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk, giving the plant its specific epithet."
