    "intro": "Combretum glutinosum var. passargei, commonly known as the sticky combretum, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves that exude a resinous substance, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or seasonal forest habitats. The sticky leaves and unique floral structure make it an interesting subject for botanical study and ecological research."
