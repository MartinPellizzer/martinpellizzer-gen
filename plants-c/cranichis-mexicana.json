    "intro": "Cranichis mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, delicate flowers with intricate patterns and a unique coloration, often in shades of white, yellow, and green. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil, and it relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
