    "intro": "Cyclotrichium stamineum, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a small annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in disturbed or open habitats. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are white or pale pink, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Cyclotrichium stamineum is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with a short growing season and the ability to store water in its tissues."
