    "intro": "Crocus dalmaticus f. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered Dalmatian crocus, is a botanical variant of the Dalmatian crocus. It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast with the typical purple or yellow hues of the species. This plant is native to the Balkan Peninsula and thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. It typically blooms in late winter or early spring, making it one of the earliest flowering crocuses. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, cup-shaped flowers that are attractive to early pollinators."
