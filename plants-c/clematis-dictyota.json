It is characterized by its climbing habit and distinctive, fern-like leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Clematis dictyota thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in coastal landscapes."
