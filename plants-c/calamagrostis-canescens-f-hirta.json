It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, silver-green leaves that are softly hairy along the edges. The plant produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate floral display. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This ornamental grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat for wildlife and aiding in soil stabilization."
