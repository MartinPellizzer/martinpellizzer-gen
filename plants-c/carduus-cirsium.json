It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and many species have been naturalized in other parts of the world. Carduus cirsium typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and some species are used in traditional medicine."
