    "intro": "Camellia foleyana, commonly known as the Foyle's camellia, is a rare and ornamental evergreen shrub native to China. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and striking, camellia-like flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant typically blooms in late winter to early spring, making it a valuable addition to gardens during the colder months. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, thriving in humid, temperate climates. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists."
