    "intro": "Cliffortia theodori-friesii var. puberula, commonly known as the soft-haired cliffortia, is a flowering plant native to the Cape Province of South Africa. It is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow, typically during the summer months. The plant has a low-growing habit with hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky outcrops and coastal areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
