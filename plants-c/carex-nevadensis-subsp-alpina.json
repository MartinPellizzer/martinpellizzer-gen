    "intro": "Carex nevadensis subsp. alpina, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-elevation environments in North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in alpine and subalpine regions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in late summer. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate frost and snow cover. Its presence is often an indicator of healthy, undisturbed alpine ecosystems."
