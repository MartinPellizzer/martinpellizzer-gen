    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy hazelnut, is a variant of the common hazel characterized by its hairy leaves and husks. It is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia, typically growing in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by edible nuts that mature in late summer. Its hairy texture distinguishes it from other hazel varieties, and it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. The species is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing food for wildlife and supporting biodiversity in forest ecosystems."
