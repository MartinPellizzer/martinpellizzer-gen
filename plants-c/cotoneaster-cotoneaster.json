    "intro": "Cotoneaster cotoneaster, commonly known as the common cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 10 meters, featuring dense, sparsely branched stems with thorn-like projections. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by red or orange berries that are attractive to birds. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. Cotoneaster cotoneaster is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
