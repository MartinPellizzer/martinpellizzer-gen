    "intro": "Caltha arctica subsp. membranacea, commonly known as the Arctic crowfoot, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions. It features a rosette of narrow, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its subspecies membranacea is distinguished by its thin, membranous leaves and shorter stature compared to other Caltha species. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
