    "intro": "Centaurea schwarzenbergiana, commonly known as the Purple Coneflower, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue to purple flowers, which are typically arranged in a conical shape. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces seeds in a fluffy, white pappus that aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Centaurea schwarzenbergiana is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
