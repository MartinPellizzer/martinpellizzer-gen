    "intro": "Caesia sabulosa, commonly known as the sandplain bluemink, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal plains of the southeastern United States. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in disturbed or open habitats. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to sandy environments. Caesia sabulosa is often found in maritime dunes and is an important component of coastal plant communities."
