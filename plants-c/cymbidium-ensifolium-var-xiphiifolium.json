    "intro": "Cymbidium ensifolium var. xiphiifolium, commonly known as the Chinese evergreen orchid, is a species native to China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and large, lance-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, often in clusters along the stems. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
