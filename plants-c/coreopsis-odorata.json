    "intro": "Coreopsis odorata, commonly known as sweetcore or fragrant coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces bright yellow to orange flower heads that resemble daisies, with ray florets surrounding a central disc of tubular flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants. Coreopsis odorata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
