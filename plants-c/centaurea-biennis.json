    "intro": "Centaurea biennis, commonly known as the brown cock's-comb, is an annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, spindly appearance with purple to brown bracts that resemble a comb. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by seed heads that persist into winter. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
