    "intro": "Coryphopteris petelotii, commonly known as the Petelot's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its upright, clumping growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds with a serrated margin. The plant produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves, typical of ferns. Native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
