It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and clusters of violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
