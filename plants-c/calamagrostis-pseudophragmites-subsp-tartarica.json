    "intro": "Calamagrostis pseudophragmites subsp. tartarica, commonly known as the Tartar grass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Siberia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often silver-white underneath. This subspecies thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowering spikes are typically green or reddish, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
