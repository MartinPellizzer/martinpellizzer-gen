    "intro": "Chenopodium ambrosioides var. polystachium, commonly known as marsh spinach, is an annual herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features succulent, alternate leaves that are typically green to reddish in color, with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which are often clustered at the tips of the stems. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, helping to stabilize soil in marshy environments. The species is valued for its edible leaves, which are used in traditional culinary practices and have a mild, slightly peppery flavor."
