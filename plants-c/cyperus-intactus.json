    "intro": "Cyperus intactus, commonly known as the spike rush, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of flowering spikes that rise from a short, rhizomatous stem. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Cyperus intactus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
