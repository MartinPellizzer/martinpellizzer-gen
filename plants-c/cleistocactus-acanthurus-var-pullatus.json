    "intro": "Cleistocactus acanthurus var. pullatus, commonly known as the variegated hedgehog cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered with short, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that open at night, a trait typical of many night-blooming cacti. Its variegated foliage, with patches of green and white, adds to its ornamental appeal. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival."
