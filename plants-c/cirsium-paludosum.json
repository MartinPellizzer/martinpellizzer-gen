    "intro": "Cirsium paludosum, commonly known as swamp thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in marshy areas, along stream banks, and in other moist soils, adapting well to waterlogged conditions. The plant features a robust root system and upright, sparsely hairy stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with rough, bristly textures and often have a bluish or purplish hue. The flower heads are purple to pink, consisting of both ray and disk flowers, and bloom from late summer to early autumn."
