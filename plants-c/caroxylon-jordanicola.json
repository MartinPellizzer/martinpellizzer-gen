    "intro": "Caroxylon jordanicola, commonly known as the Jordanian sand thorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its small, spiny leaves and yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access underground water sources. Caroxylon jordanicola plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
