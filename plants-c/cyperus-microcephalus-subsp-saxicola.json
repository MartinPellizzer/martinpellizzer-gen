    "intro": "Cyperus microcephalus subsp. saxicola, commonly known as the rock flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowering spikes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. It is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats, such as roadsides and dry grasslands."
