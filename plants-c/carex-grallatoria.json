    "intro": "Carex grallatoria, commonly known as the tropical sedge, is a perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, preferring partial to full shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Carex grallatoria is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
