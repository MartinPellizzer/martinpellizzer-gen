    "intro": "Chrysalidocarpus oleraceus, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Indo-Pacific region. It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The tree produces clusters of yellowish-green, fleshy fruits that are rich in carbohydrates and have been a staple food in many island cultures. The fruit's outer husk hardens as it matures, protecting the edible, starchy pulp inside. Its botanical significance lies in its role as both a food source and a cultural symbol in tropical ecosystems."
