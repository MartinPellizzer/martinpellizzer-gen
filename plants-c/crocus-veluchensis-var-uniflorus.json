It produces a single, striking violet-blue flower with a distinctive purple eye, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to well-drained, rocky soils. It is valued for its beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a delicate species requiring specific growing conditions."
