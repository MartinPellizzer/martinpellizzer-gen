    "intro": "Clematis montana var. trichogyna, commonly known as the waxy leaf clematis, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its waxy, dark green foliage and clusters of fragrant, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a vigorous, flowering vine. Its rapid growth habit requires support structures such as trellises or fences. The varietal name \"trichogyna\" refers to the hairy (trichous) texture of its stems and leaves."
