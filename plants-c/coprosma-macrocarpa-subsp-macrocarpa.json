    "intro": "Coprosma macrocarpa subsp. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited coprosma, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for native birds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
