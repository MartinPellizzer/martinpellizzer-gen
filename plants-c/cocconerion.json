    "intro": "Cocconerion, commonly known as the African waterwheel, is a striking aquatic plant native to southern Africa. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that radiate outward from a central stem, often forming a wheel-like appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters at the water's surface, adding a delicate touch to its aquatic habitat. Its roots help stabilize the substrate and provide shelter for aquatic life. Cocconerion thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, making it a popular choice for water gardens and ponds."
