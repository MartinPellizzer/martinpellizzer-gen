    "intro": "Coprosma cuneata, commonly known as the narrowleaf coprosma, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves that are typically narrow and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark blue or black berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland forest areas. Coprosma cuneata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to form dense foliage."
