    "intro": "Cyrtandra umbellifera, commonly known as the umbrella flower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its showy, clustered inflorescences that resemble an umbrella, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. Its flowers are usually brightly colored, ranging from white to pink or red, and are adapted for pollination by birds and insects. Cyrtandra umbellifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems as a food source for native fauna."
