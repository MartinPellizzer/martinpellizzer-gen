    "intro": "Cynoglossum glandulosum, commonly known as sticky bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its scientific name reflects its tongue-shaped flowers and glandular surfaces, which are key botanical features. Cynoglossum glandulosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens."
