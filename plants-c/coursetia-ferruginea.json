    "intro": "Coursetia ferruginea, commonly known as the rust-colored coursetia, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a rusty or reddish-brown pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elongated, woody fruits. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Coursetia ferruginea is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
