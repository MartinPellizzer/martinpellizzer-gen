    "intro": "Conchocarpus cyrtanthus, commonly known as the velvetleaf or wild cotton, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread, it is considered a weed in some regions."
