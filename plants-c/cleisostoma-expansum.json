It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, showy flowers that open at night. The plant produces pale yellow to white petals with a distinctive, recurved lip that attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often with a waxy texture, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Cleisostoma expansum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and unique blooming habit."
