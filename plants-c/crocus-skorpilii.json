    "intro": "Crocus skorpilii, commonly known as the Karst crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its distinctive, pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a single, showy flower with reflexed petals and a prominent, three-lobed style. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
