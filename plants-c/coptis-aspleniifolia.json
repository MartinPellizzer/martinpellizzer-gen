It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Coptis aspleniifolia is also valued for its medicinal properties, containing alkaloids with potential therapeutic uses."
