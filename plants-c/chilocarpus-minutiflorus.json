    "intro": "Chilocarpus minutiflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered chilocarpus, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Proteaceae. It is native to South America, particularly found in the Andean regions of Bolivia and Peru. The plant is characterized by its compact shrub form, with small, clustered leaves and delicate, white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
