    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. cylindrochlamys, commonly known as the cylindrical-hair hazel, is a variant of the common hazelnut. It is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical bracts that enclose the female flowers, distinguishing it from other hazel species. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with compound leaves that are serrated along the edges. Its flowers are monoecious, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. This variety is often found in temperate regions and is valued for both its ornamental and edible qualities."
