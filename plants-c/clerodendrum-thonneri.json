It is characterized by its striking red-orange inflorescences that resemble flames, which bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and prefers well-drained soil. The bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
