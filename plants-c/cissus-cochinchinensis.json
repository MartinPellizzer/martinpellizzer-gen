    "intro": "Cissus cochinchinensis, commonly known as the creeping fig or Indian nettle, is a species of flowering plant in the family Vitaceae. It is a perennial vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and tendrils that allow it to climb and spread across surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into edible, fleshy berries. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
