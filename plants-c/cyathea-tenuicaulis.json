    "intro": "Cyathea tenuicaulis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats. The fronds are typically evergreen and contribute to the plant's ornamental value in horticulture."
