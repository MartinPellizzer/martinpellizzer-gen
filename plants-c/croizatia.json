    "intro": "Croizatia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, often yellow or orange flowers. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Croizatia species are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas due to their rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
