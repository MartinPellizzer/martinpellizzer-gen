    "intro": "Conocephalus ellipticus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf false nettle, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes stinging nettles, and features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine, though it is not as widely utilized as other members of its family. The plant is often found in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade."
