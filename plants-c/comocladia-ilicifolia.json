    "intro": "Comocladia ilicifolia, commonly known as the coastal holly or seaside holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant has small, holly-like leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a leathery texture. Its flowers are small and white, appearing in clusters, and it produces small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Comocladia ilicifolia is well adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it a hardy and resilient coastal plant."
