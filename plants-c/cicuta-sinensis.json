    "intro": "Cicuta sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese water hemlock, is a highly toxic member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its smooth, hollow stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist environments such as wetlands and stream banks. Due to its potent toxicity, it is often considered one of the most dangerous plants in its native range."
