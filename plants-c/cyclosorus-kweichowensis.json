    "intro": "Cyclosorus kweichowensis, commonly known as the Kweichow cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern native to China. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are often divided into four lobes. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its reproductive structures are submerged, and it produces tiny, yellowish sporocarps that release spores for propagation. Due to habitat loss and pollution, this species is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
