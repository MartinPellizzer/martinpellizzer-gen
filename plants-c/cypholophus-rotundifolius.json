    "intro": "Cypholophus rotundifolius, commonly known as the round-leaved orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and broad, rounded leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
