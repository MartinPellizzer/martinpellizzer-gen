    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 ampullacea, commonly known as the kaffir lime. It is a hybrid citrus plant native to Southeast Asia, characterized by its fragrant, wrinkled green zest and small, sour fruits. The leaves are broadly ovate with a distinctive wrinkled texture and a strong aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellow-green fruits with a high concentration of essential oils, making it valuable in both culinary and aromatic applications. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its zest rather than its fruit."
