    "intro": "Cnidium longeradiatum, commonly known as the Chinese snakeplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its erect, slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbellate clusters, a typical feature of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Cnidium longeradiatum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats."
