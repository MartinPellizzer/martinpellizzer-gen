    "intro": "Ciminalis ligustica, commonly known as the Ligusticum ciminalis, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill, and is characterized by its aromatic, often fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. However, it is important to note that the plant can be toxic in high doses and should be handled with care."
