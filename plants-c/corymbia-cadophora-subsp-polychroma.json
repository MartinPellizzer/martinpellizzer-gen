    "intro": "Corymbia cadophora subsp. polychroma, commonly known as the red gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin sheets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are lance-shaped, glossy, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. The tree is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in horticulture for its unique bark and foliage."
