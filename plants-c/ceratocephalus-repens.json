    "intro": "Ceratocephalus repens, commonly known as the creeping sandmat, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It has a sprawling growth habit with numerous stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are often followed by distinctive, elongated seed pods. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. Ceratocephalus repens is well-suited to dry conditions and is often found in coastal dunes and inland sandy areas."
