    "intro": "Cecropia telealba var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy ceiba, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive, swollen, woody stems that form a buttressed base. The plant is typically found in humid, lowland forests and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a unique, fragrant odor that attracts pollinators. The bark of this species is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
