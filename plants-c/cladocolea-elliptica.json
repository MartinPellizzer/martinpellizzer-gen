    "intro": "Cladocolea elliptica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water efficiently. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white, often during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it an ideal plant for xeriscaping and low-maintenance landscapes."
