    "intro": "Ctenitis subconnexa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates in humid, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Ctenitis subconnexa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
