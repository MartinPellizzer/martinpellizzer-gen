    "intro": "Cheilanthes sonorensis, commonly known as the Sonoran rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is well adapted to drought conditions. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces spores in compact, stalked clusters called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. This species is valued for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
