    "intro": "Ceriscoides howii, commonly known as the Howii ceriscoides, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Ceriscoides howii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
