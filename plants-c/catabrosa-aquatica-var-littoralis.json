    "intro": "Catabrosa aquatica var. littoralis, commonly known as the water catabrosa, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 60 cm in height, often with a reddish tinge. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often floating or submerged depending on water levels. This species is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats and plays a role in stabilizing shoreline vegetation."
