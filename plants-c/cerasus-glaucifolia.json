    "intro": "Cerasus glaucifolia, commonly known as the glaucous cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy, bluish-white coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, which are typically pink or white, followed by edible berries that turn from red to dark purple as they mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit. The species is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
