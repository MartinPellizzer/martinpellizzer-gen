It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Cestrum palmeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
