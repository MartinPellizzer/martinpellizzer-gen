    "intro": "Citronella incarum, commonly known as the lemon-scented grass, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, aromatic stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that emit a strong lemony fragrance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which are often used in ornamental gardening. Citronella incarum is also valued for its essential oils, which are extracted from its leaves and used in natural insect repellents. Its botanical features make it both a useful and attractive addition to tropical landscapes."
