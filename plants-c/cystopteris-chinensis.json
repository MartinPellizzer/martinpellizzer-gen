    "intro": "Cystopteris chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically bright green and often have a waxy coating. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Cystopteris chinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
