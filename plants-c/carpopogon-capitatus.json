    "intro": "Carpopogon capitatus, commonly known as the purple top grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and striking purple to blue flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are often clustered at the ends of its stems. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of water bodies. Carpopogon capitatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and wildlife."
