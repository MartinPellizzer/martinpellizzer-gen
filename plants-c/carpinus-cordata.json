    "intro": "Carpinus cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf hornbeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its oval, heart-shaped leaves that are typically 2 to 4 inches long and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, spherical fruits that mature to a dark blue color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Carpinus cordata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
