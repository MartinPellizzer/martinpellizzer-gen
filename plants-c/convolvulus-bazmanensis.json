    "intro": "Convolvulus bazmanensis, commonly known as the Bazman morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Iran. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant has slender, twining stems that climb or trail along the ground, often forming dense mats. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are typically five-lobed with a distinctive spur. This species is adapted to dry environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
