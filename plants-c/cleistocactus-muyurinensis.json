    "intro": "Cleistocactus muyurinensis, commonly known as the \"pale moon cactus,\" is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically pale green or blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, pale flowers that open only at night, a trait that aids in pollination by nocturnal insects. It is well adapted to dry environments, with a shallow root system and a capacity to store water in its stems. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
