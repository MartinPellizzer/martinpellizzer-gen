    "intro": "Cyclosorus cretaceus, commonly known as the cretaceous cyclosorus, is a rare and ancient fern species. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of more primitive ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or calcareous soils. Its spore-producing structures are small and clustered, typical of the family Hymenophyllaceae. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
