    "intro": "Cytisus ramosissimus var. glabratus, commonly known as the glabrous broom, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, though the variety glabratus is distinguished by its smoother, hairless foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. This plant is part of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, which contribute to soil fertility."
