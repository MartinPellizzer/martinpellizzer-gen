    "intro": "Cystopteris perriniana, commonly known as the Perrin's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in small, clustered soruses on the underside of the fronds. Cystopteris perriniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
