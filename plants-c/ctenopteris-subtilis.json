    "intro": "Ctenopteris subtilis, commonly known as the slender sea palm, is a species of marine fern that thrives in shallow coastal waters. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble the structure of a palm tree, though it is not closely related to true palms. The plant has a unique ability to tolerate saltwater, making it a common sight in intertidal zones along tropical and subtropical shores. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the undersides of its fronds. Ctenopteris subtilis plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for small marine organisms."
