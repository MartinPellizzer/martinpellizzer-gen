    "intro": "Crepinia squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly sedum, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and thick, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it an interesting addition to botanical collections."
