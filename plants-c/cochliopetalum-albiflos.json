    "intro": "Cochliopetalum albiflos, commonly known as the white-flowered sterculia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a sweet fragrance. Its fruits are capsules that split open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal. Cochliopetalum albiflos is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
