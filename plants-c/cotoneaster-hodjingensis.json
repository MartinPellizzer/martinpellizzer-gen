    "intro": "Cotoneaster hodjingensis, commonly known as the Hodjing cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces clusters of white to pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by red berries in the fall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant seasonal changes and compact growth habit. Cotoneaster hodjingensis is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils."
