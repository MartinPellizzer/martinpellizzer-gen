    "intro": "Cardamine aschersoniana, commonly known as the ascherson's watercress, is a small flowering plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small white or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in stream banks, wet meadows, and other damp habitats, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery taste similar to watercress, making it a potential culinary and medicinal plant. However, it is often overlooked due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution."
