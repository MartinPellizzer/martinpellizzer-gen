    "intro": "Cestrum grandistipulum, commonly known as the large-leaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Its leaves are simple and opposite, with a velvety texture. Cestrum grandistipulum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a source of natural insect repellent."
