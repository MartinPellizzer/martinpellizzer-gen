It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its striking red and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its foliage consists of finely divided leaves that are aromatic and often used in traditional Chinese medicine. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
