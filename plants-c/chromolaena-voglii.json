    "intro": "Chromolaena voglii, commonly known as the flame bush, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and clusters of bright red or orange flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges due to its rapid growth and adaptability. Chromolaena voglii is also noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in horticulture."
