    "intro": "Calamus kunstleri subsp. microstachys, commonly known as the dwarf calamus, is a member of the Aroid family (Araceae). It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with greenish-white spadices and yellow stamens, typical of the genus Calamus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands, preferring well-drained, organic-rich soils. This subspecies is relatively compact compared to other Calamus species, making it a desirable ornamental plant in aquatic and bog gardens."
