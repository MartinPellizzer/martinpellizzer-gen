    "intro": "Cardamine amara subf. ramosa, commonly known as the slender water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Ranunculaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, floating leaves that form a rosette on the water surface, with long, thin stems that often trail beneath the water. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers with five sepals and numerous stamens, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. Due to its delicate structure and preference for moist environments, it is often found in temperate regions across Europe and parts of Asia."
