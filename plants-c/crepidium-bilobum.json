    "intro": "Crepidium bilobum, commonly known as the two-lobed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and wetlands. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in a spike, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it has a rhizomatous root system that helps it survive in wet environments. The species is part of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and ecological adaptations."
