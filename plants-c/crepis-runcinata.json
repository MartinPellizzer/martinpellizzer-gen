    "intro": "Crepis runcinata, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wetlands. Its leaves are hairy and narrow, which helps in reducing water loss in wet environments. Crepis runcinata is an important plant in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in soil stabilization."
