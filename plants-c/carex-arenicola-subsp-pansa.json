    "intro": "Carex arenicola subsp. pansa, commonly known as the sand sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, typically forming clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or disturbed areas. Due to its drought tolerance, it is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
