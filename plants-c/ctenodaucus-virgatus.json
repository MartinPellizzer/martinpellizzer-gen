It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically pink to purple and bloom in late spring to early summer. Ctenodaucus virgatus is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
