    "intro": "Cyclosorus maxonianus, commonly known as the Maxonian water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Oleaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in diameter. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread across the water surface through vegetative propagation. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with small, oval-shaped pinnae that give it a feathery appearance. Cyclosorus maxonianus thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and marshy areas."
