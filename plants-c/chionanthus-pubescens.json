    "intro": "Chionanthus pubescens, commonly known as the silverleaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its fruit is a small, dark blue to black berry that matures in the fall. The silverleaf honeysuckle is valued for its ornamental beauty and ability to thrive in partial shade."
