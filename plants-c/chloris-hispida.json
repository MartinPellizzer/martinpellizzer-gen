    "intro": "Chloris hispida, commonly known as hairy grass or slender wickweed, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It features slender, wiry stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which bloom in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed sites. Chloris hispida is drought-tolerant and is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil."
