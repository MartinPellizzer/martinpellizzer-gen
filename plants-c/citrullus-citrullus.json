It is native to Africa and is characterized by its large, lobed leaves and thick, fleshy stems. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that give way to the familiar bright red, juicy fruit. The fruit is typically divided into segments with a white, fibrous rind and a sweet, water-rich pulp. It is widely cultivated for its edible fruit, which is rich in vitamins and minerals."
