    "intro": "Cyclosorus biformatus, commonly known as the two-lobed liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its leafy shoots and distinctive, bilaterally symmetrical leaves that are often divided into two lobes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including the peristome and operculum, are well-developed and aid in spore dispersal. Cyclosorus biformatus is a non-vascular plant that plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms."
