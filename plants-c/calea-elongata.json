The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardens in warm climates. Calea elongata is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
