    "intro": "Convolvulus valerianoides, commonly known as the valerian creeper, is a flowering plant belonging to the bindweed family (Convolvulaceae). It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
