    "intro": "Carex rigida var. ripensis, commonly known as rigid sedge, is a perennial plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It is characterized by its stiff, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in a dense, cylindrical cluster. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes, which are typically borne on separate stalks from the leaves. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and pond edges. Due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life, it is an important species in ecological restoration projects."
