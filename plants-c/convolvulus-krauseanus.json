    "intro": "Convolvulus krauseanus, commonly known as the Krause's morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and is often found growing along rocky outcrops and in disturbed soils. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions. The flowers bloom in the early morning, hence its common name, and are pollinated primarily by insects."
