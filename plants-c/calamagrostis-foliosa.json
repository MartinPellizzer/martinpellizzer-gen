    "intro": "Calamagrostis foliosa, commonly known as the silver feather reed grass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, silver-green leaves that are often described as having a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pale green to golden in color. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other riparian habitats. Calamagrostis foliosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
