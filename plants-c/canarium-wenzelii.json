    "intro": "Canarium wenzelii, commonly known as the Wenzel's candlenut, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark grey bark and elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. Its latex, similar to that of other canarium species, has been used traditionally for various purposes, including as a chewing gum. The tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
