It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in strobili, which are borne on the underside of the fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
