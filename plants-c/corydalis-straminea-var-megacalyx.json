    "intro": "Corydalis straminea var. megacalyx, commonly known as the giant yellow lousewort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It features slender, hairy stems that grow up to 30 cm in height, often branching near the base. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers with two upper petals and two lower, spurred petals, typical of the Fumariaceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or rocky habitats. This variant is distinguished by its larger calyx compared to other Corydalis species, giving it its specific epithet \"megacalyx.\""
