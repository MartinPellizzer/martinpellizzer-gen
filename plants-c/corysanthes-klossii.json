It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, edible fruits that are sometimes used in traditional medicine. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
