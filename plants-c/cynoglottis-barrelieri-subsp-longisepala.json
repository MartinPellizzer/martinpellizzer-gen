    "intro": "Cynoglottis barrelieri subsp. longisepala, commonly known as the long-sepaled cynoglottis, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and finely divided, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is often found in moist, shaded habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and lesser-known botanical species."
