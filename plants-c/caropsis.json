    "intro": "Caropsis, commonly known as the nutlet or false nut, is a type of dry, indehiscent fruit that develops from the inferior ovary of certain flowering plants. It is typically composed of a hard, woody pericarp that encloses a single seed. This structure is characteristic of plants in the family Fagaceae, which includes oaks and beeches. The caropsis often resembles a true nut in appearance but lacks the hard inner shell found in true nuts. It plays an important role in the dispersal and propagation of these woody species."
