    "intro": "Chionanthus crassifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf chionanthus, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically 3\u20136 inches long and have a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces fragrant, white to cream-colored flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes and emit a sweet, honey-like scent. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. The species is also valued for its adaptability and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
