    "intro": "Ceratoides compacta, commonly known as the mountain stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in the spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. Its adaptations to harsh conditions make it an important species in high-elevation ecosystems."
