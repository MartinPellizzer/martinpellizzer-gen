    "intro": "Cadelium, commonly known as the silverleaf cadelium, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits. Cadelium thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in arid environments."
