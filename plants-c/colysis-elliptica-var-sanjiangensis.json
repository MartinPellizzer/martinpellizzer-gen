It is characterized by its elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy in appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming during the spring season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountainous forests and streamside habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
