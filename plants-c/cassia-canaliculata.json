    "intro": "Cassia canaliculata, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping panicles of bright yellow flowers, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open when mature to release the seeds. Cassia canaliculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
