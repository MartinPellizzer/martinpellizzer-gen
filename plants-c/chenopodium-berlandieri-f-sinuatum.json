It is characterized by its rough, spiny leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in open fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly as a food source for certain insects and birds."
