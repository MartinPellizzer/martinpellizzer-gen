    "intro": "Combretum coriifolium, commonly known as the rough-leaved flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, winged fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and seasonal flowering."
