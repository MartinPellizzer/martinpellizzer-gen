    "intro": "Candidea stenostegia, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed candleplant, is a member of the Aizoaceae family, native to South Africa. It is characterized by its unique, candle-like appearance with thick, fleshy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Candidea stenostegia thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
