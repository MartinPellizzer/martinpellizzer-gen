    "intro": "Clidemia maculata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or spotted nettle, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive velvety texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Clidemia maculata is also known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
