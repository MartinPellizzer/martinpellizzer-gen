    "intro": "Chamaesyce microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are densely packed along its prostrate stems, which often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and rapid growth, it is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and disturbed soils."
