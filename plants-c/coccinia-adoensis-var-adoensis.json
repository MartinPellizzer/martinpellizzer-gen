    "intro": "Coccinia adoensis var. adoensis, commonly known as the African butterfruit, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and pumpkins, and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and yellow-orange flowers. The fruit is typically round, with a smooth, waxy skin that turns from green to orange as it matures. It produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible when ripe, though they are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
