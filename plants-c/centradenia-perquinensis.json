    "intro": "Centradenia perquinensis, commonly known as the Perquin's centradenia, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features opposite, simple leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small, clustered, and often have a distinctive coloration that aids in attracting pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Centradenia perquinensis is of interest to botanists studying plant biodiversity and conservation."
