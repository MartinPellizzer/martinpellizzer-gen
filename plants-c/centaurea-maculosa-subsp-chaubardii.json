    "intro": "Centaurea maculosa subsp. chaubardii, commonly known as the spotted knapweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its bright purple to pink flowers and distinctive, spiny seed heads. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including meadows and roadsides. It has lance-shaped leaves with toothed margins and produces small, dark seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
