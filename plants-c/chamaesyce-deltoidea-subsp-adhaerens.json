It typically features small, oval to deltoid-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and wetlands. Its unique foliage and adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study and ecological research."
