    "intro": "Centaurea jacea var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf coneflower, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to Europe. It features upright, sparsely hairy stems that bear clusters of bright red-orange flower heads, which are surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its compact growth habit and vibrant flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
