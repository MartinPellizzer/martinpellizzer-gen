    "intro": "Cardamine diversifolia, commonly known as the variable water crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a dense inflorescence. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize wet meadows and stream banks. The leaves and stems are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
