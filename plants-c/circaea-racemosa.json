It typically thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, linear, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
