    "intro": "Cynanchum magale, commonly known as the Chinese milkweed vine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its trailing stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by follicles containing toxic, milky sap. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
