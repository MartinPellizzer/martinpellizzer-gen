    "intro": "Cachrys longiloba, commonly known as the long-stemmed candleplant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, reducing water loss through transpiration. Cachrys longiloba is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils."
