    "intro": "Centratherum punctatum f. brachyphyllum, commonly known as the dwarf spikegrass, is a compact, mat-forming perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features dense, short inflorescences with small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a desirable plant for small spaces."
