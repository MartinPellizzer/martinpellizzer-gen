    "intro": "Caroxylon villosum, commonly known as the hairy caroxylon, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southwestern North America. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Caroxylon villosum is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats."
