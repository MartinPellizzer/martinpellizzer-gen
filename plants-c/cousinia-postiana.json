    "intro": "Cousinia postiana, commonly known as the Kashmiri globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayas. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments. The plant features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Cousinia postiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
