    "intro": "Cupressus goveniana var. glauca, commonly known as the Blue Atlas Cedar, is a variety of the Atlas cedar native to the mountainous regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a conical shape with dense, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed on the branches. It produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, and it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal. This evergreen tree is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is relatively drought-tolerant."
