    "intro": "Cienfuegosia somalensis, commonly known as the Somali cienfuegosia, is a rare shrub native to the dry, arid regions of Somalia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and produces delicate, yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
