    "intro": "Cephalantheropsis venusta, commonly known as the beautiful hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, hood-like flower that is usually pale green or yellow with red or orange markings. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has a rhizomatous root system. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is pollinated by flies and other insects. The species is relatively rare and is considered a conservation concern in some regions due to habitat loss."
