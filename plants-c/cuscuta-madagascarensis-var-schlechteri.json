    "intro": "Cuscuta madagascarensis var. schlechteri, commonly known as the Madagascar dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to Madagascar. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to other plants through haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. It is an annual species, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ecological role is primarily as a parasite, affecting the growth of its host plants."
