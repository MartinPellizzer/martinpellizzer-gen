It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky, arid environments at elevations above 3,000 meters. The plant features a rosette of fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, producing a distinctive, somewhat unpleasant odor. Chuquiraga pseudoruscifolia is adapted to extreme conditions, with specialized structures that help it conserve water and withstand cold temperatures."
