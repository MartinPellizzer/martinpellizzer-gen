    "intro": "Colutea alpina, commonly known as the alpine bugloss, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its basal rosette of palmate leaves. The plant produces small, violet or purple flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind. Colutea alpina is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
