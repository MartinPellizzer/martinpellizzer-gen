    "intro": "Cassia newtonii, commonly known as the Desert Cassia, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in dry conditions. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in desert regions. Cassia newtonii plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
