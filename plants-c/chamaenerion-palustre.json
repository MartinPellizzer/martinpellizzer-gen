    "intro": "Chamaenerion palustre, commonly known as rosebay willowherb, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe, Asia, and North America. It is a perennial herb that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, characterized by its reddish stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pink to reddish flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It has a fibrous root system and is often found in marshy areas, along streambanks, and in disturbed soils. Chamaenerion palustre is also known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal."
