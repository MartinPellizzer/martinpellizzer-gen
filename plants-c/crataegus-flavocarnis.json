    "intro": "Crataegus flavocarnis, commonly known as the yellow-fleshed hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, orange to red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and have serrated edges, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. Crataegus flavocarnis is also valued for its ecological role, providing food for birds and insects."
