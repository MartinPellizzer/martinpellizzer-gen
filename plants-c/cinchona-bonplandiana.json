    "intro": "Cinchona bonplandiana, commonly known as the Peruvian quinine tree, is a species of the Rubiaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries containing seeds. It is closely related to other cinchona species, which are historically significant for their use in producing quinine. Due to its medicinal properties and ecological importance, it is often found in cloud forests and is valued for its role in traditional medicine."
