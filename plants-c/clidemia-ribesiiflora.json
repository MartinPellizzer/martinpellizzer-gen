It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in the spring and summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Clidemia ribesiiflora is also known for its ability to spread aggressively, making it an invasive species in some regions."
