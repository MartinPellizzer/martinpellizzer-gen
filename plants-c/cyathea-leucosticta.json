    "intro": "Cyathea leucosticta, commonly known as the white-streaked tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a distinctive white or pale-colored midrib running down the center of its fronds, which gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Cyathea leucosticta plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
