    "intro": "Canarium commune var. zephyrinum, commonly known as the Zephyrinum candlenut, is a variant of the candlenut tree native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and fragrant, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain a hard-shelled seed, which is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in coastal areas due to its tolerance for salt spray. The botanical features of this variant make it valuable for both ornamental and practical purposes in horticulture."
