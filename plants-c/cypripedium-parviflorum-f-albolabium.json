    "intro": "Cypripedium parviflorum f. albolabium, commonly known as the white-labellum lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers with a distinctive, pouch-like lip that is often marked with a pale yellow or white labellum. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. This orchid is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists due to its rarity and ornamental value."
