    "intro": "Capsella savonica, commonly known as the common mouse-ear or mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, pale green to white flowers with four petals, typically blooming in spring. The plant has hairy, succulent stems and leaves that are often heart-shaped or kidney-shaped. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it both a weed and a plant of ecological interest."
