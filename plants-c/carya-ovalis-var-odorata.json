    "intro": "Carya ovalis var. odorata, commonly known as the fragrant hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the walnut family (Juglandaceae) and is characterized by its oval-shaped, edible nuts enclosed in a thick, spiny husk. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a serrated margin, while the bark is deeply furrowed and grayish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, and its fruit is an important food source for wildlife. The variety 'odorata' is distinguished by its strong, pleasant fragrance, which is more pronounced in the flowers and young foliage."
