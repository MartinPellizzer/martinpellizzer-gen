    "intro": "Cardamine prorepens, commonly known as the creeping water shield, is a small, herbaceous plant native to moist, temperate regions. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers with five sepals and no true petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats, often forming dense mats. Due to its preference for moist environments, it is an indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
