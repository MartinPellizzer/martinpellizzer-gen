    "intro": "Conophytum quaesitum subsp. quaesitum, commonly known as the \"skeleton flower,\" is a compact, succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically rounded and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
