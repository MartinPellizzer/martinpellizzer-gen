    "intro": "Chaerophyllum laevigatum, commonly known as smooth hogweed, is a flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in an umbel, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its resemblance to other toxic plants, it can be mistaken for more harmful species, requiring careful identification."
