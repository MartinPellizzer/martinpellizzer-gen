    "intro": "Cirsium breweri var. glutinosum, commonly known as the sticky yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and sticky, glandular hairs that cover its stems and leaves. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough, serrated edge. The sticky hairs on its surface help deter herbivores and reduce water loss, making it well adapted to its arid environment."
