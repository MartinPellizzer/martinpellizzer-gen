    "intro": "Ceratopteris pteridoides, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its fronds are divided into numerous pinnae, which are further subdivided into smaller pinnules. The plant reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds."
