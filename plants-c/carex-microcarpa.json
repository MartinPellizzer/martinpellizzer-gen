    "intro": "Carex microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often reddish or brownish in color. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Carex microcarpa plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
