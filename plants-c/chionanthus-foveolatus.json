    "intro": "Chionanthus foveolatus, commonly known as the frost flower or snowbell, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fragrant, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and a smooth, grayish bark. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun. The frost flower gets its common name from the way its flowers resemble small, delicate snowflakes."
