    "intro": "Convallaria quadrifida, commonly known as the four-leaf lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Convallariaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many areas, highlighting the need for its protection."
