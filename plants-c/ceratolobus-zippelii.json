    "intro": "Ceratolobus zippelii, commonly known as the Zippel's thorn, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure with thorny stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
