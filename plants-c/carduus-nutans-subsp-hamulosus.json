    "intro": "Carduus nutans subsp. hamulosus, commonly known as the nodding thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, purple to pinkish flower heads that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically lobed and covered in fine hairs, and the plant produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. This subspecies is closely related to other thistle species within the Asteraceae family."
