    "intro": "Carduus nutans var. heldreichii, commonly known as the Heldreich's thistle, is a perennial herb native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It features robust, spiny stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, often with a reddish tinge. The plant produces large, yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer, surrounded by a series of bracts. Its leaves are typically broad, lobed, and covered in coarse hairs, with a distinctive basal rosette structure. This variety is notable for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor, rocky soils."
