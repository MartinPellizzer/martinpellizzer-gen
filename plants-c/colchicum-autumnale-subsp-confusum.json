    "intro": "Colchicum autumnale subsp. confusum, commonly known as the autumn crocus or meadow saffron, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has strap-like, wavy leaves that emerge from a bulbous corm, and its flowers are typically borne on tall, slender stems. It is characterized by its distinctive, spurred petals and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and damp grasslands. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not to be confused with edible plants."
