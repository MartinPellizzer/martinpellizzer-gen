    "intro": "Castilleja hispida subsp. abbreviata, commonly known as the short-stemmed Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright orange to red bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on host plants for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
