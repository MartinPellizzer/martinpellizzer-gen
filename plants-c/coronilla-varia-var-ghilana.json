    "intro": "Coronilla varia var. ghilana, commonly known as the variable vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or dry soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by slender, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. Its trifoliate leaves are palmately arranged, with each leaflet being oval and slightly hairy. Coronilla varia var. ghilana is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration and as a forage plant."
