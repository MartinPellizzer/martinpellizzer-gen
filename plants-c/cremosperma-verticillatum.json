It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves around the stem, which gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in fynbos vegetation. The species is noted for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation."
