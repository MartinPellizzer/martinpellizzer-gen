It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds and other flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers, which are typically clustered in umbels. It prefers shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
