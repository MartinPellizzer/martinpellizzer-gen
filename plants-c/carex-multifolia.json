    "intro": "Carex multifolia, commonly known as the many-leaved sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in a dense, compact cluster. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets, which are often wind-pollinated. Carex multifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It is a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
