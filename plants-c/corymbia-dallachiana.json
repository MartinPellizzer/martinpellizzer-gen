    "intro": "Corymbia dallachiana, commonly known as the red gum or red bloodwood, is a species of eucalyptus native to the northern regions of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive red-brown bark that peels in thin, flaky layers, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, fibrous texture. This hardy tree is often found in dry, open forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance."
