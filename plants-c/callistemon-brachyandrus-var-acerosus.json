    "intro": "Callistemon brachyandrus var. acerosus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bottlebrush, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and striking red or pink bottlebrush-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is evergreen, with a compact growth habit and a tendency to form dense, rounded clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. The variety acerosus is distinguished by its hardier, more robust stems compared to the typical species."
