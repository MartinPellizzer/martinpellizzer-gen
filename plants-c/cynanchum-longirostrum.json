    "intro": "Cynanchum longirostrum, commonly known as the long-beaked milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to regions of Asia, including China and the Russian Far East. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its fruits are follicles that split open to release seeds. Cynanchum longirostrum is often found in grassy areas and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is also noted for its latex-like sap, which can be toxic and has been used in traditional medicine."
