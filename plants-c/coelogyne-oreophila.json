    "intro": "Coelogyne oreophila, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically blooms during the cooler months, and its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in its natural habitat. Coelogyne oreophila prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden settings. Its unique floral structure and ornamental value make it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts."
