    "intro": "Chrysothamnus depressus, commonly known as the yellow rabbitbrush, is a shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has silver-gray foliage and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. It is adapted to arid environments and has deep roots that help it survive in poor soil conditions. The yellow rabbitbrush plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
