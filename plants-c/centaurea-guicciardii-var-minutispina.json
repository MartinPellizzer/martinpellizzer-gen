    "intro": "Centaurea guicciardii var. minutispina, commonly known as the narrow-spined centaurea, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems and small, blue to purple flowers arranged in dense, spherical inflorescences. The leaves are linear to lance-shaped, with a hairy texture, and the plant produces small, spiny bracts that give it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact growth and vivid floral display."
