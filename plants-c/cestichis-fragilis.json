    "intro": "Cestichis fragilis, commonly known as the brittle cestichis, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus plants. The plant is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its fragile appearance. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Cestichis fragilis is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
