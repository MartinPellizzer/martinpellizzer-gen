    "intro": "Colchicum longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, nodding flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. Its bulbs are toxic and contain colchicine, a compound used in medicine. Colchicum longipes typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in cooler, shaded environments."
