    "intro": "[WRONG START] Cerastium ledeburianum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands. Cerastium ledeburianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
