    "intro": "Callianthemum tibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan crownflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to the cold and arid conditions of its native habitat. Callianthemum tibeticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
