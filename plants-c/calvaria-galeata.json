    "intro": "Calvaria galeata, commonly known as the helmet fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its distinctive, helmet-like spore cases. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in rounded, cap-like formations on the underside of the fronds. Calvaria galeata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or in forest understories."
