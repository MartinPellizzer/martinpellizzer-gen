    "intro": "Cortiella yatungensis, commonly known as the Yatung cup fungus, is a species of corticolous (tree-dwelling) lichen. It belongs to the family Verrucariaceae and is characterized by its foliose thallus with a dense, leathery texture. The fruiting bodies, or apothecia, are small and typically appear as dark, cup-shaped structures. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on the bark of broad-leaved trees. The lichen is notable for its chemical composition, which includes various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
