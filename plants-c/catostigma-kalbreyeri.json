    "intro": "Catostigma kalbreyeri, commonly known as the Kalbreyer's catostigma, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a glossy surface, while its stems are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in the wild."
