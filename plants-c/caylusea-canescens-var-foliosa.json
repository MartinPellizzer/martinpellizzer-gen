    "intro": "Caylusea canescens var. foliosa, commonly known as the hairy leaf caylusea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a rough texture due to the dense covering of fine hairs. The flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, making it a notable species in its native habitat."
