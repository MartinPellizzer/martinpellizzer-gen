    "intro": "Carduus obvallatus, commonly known as the globe thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical seed heads that resemble a globe, which give it its common name. The plant produces blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Carduus obvallatus is often found in dry, rocky soils and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
