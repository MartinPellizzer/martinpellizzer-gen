    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis stenophylla f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed ironwood, is a variant of the species native to Southeast Asia. It is a large evergreen tree characterized by its broad, lanceolate leaves that are typically leathery and dark green. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by hard, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems. Due to its dense wood and slow growth, it is valued for timber and ecological stability in its native habitats."
