    "intro": "Cyclosorus scallanii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water clover, is a species of aquatic fern found in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, opposite, ovate leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of the leaves, which are released into the water for spore dispersal. It thrives in slow-moving or still waters with rich organic substrates. Cyclosorus scallanii plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for microorganisms."
