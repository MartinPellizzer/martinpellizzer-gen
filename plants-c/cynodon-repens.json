    "intro": "Cynodon repens, commonly known as Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread rapidly and form dense mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a common lawn grass in warm climates. Its ability to regenerate quickly after grazing or mowing makes it an important forage crop in many regions."
