    "intro": "Ceratostachys, commonly known as the horned grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, often curved bracts that resemble horns, giving it its common name. These plants are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. Ceratostachys species are often used in ornamental horticulture due to their unique appearance and drought tolerance. They produce small, spike-like inflorescences that are often adorned with silky or hairy structures."
