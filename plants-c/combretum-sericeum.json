    "intro": "Combretum sericeum, commonly known as silky combretum, is a deciduous shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silky white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale yellow or greenish in color, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in warm climates."
