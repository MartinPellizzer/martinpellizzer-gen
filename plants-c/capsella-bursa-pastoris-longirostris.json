It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae, characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers. The species is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its long beak-like structure on the fruit, known as a silique, is a notable botanical feature. This plant is often considered a weed but has been studied for its ecological and potential medicinal properties."
