    "intro": "Carex lurida var. exudans, commonly known as the exuding sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers. The plant is typically found in areas with consistently moist soil, such as along stream banks or in swampy forests. Its leaves are often coated with a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in saturated environments. The variety exudans is distinguished by the secretion of a sticky, resinous substance from its leaf margins, a feature that may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
