    "intro": "Cynanchum eulaxiflorum, commonly known as the narrow-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap, which is typical of the genus Cynanchum. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
