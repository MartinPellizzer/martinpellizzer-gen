    "intro": "Crotalaria doniana, commonly known as the African cowpea or the yellow burr legume, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by distinctive pod-like fruits containing toxic seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
