    "intro": "Cardamine hirsuta var. antiscorbutica, commonly known as the scurvy grass, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its hairy, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers. Native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is notable for its high vitamin C content, which historically made it valuable in preventing scurvy. Its botanical features include rhizomes, trifoliate leaves, and a preference for calcareous soils."
