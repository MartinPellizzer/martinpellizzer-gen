    "intro": "Coptis teeta subvar. rhizomatosa, commonly known as the Tibetan barberry, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often bitter. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin. This species is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its alkaloid content, which has been used in traditional medicine."
