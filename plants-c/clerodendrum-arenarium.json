    "intro": "Clerodendrum arenarium, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and small, often hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or violet in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. The plant's ornamental value and hardiness make it a popular choice for gardeners in hot, dry climates."
