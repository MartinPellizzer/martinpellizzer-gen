    "intro": "Caprifolium, commonly known as honeysuckle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caprifoliaceae. It is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically has opposite, simple leaves that are ovate or lanceolate in shape. Many species of caprifolium are deciduous, shedding their leaves in the fall, while others are evergreen. It is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of edible berries."
