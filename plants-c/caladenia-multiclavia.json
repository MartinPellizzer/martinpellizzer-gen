    "intro": "Caladenia multiclavia, commonly known as the multi-clawed spider orchid, is an exquisite member of the orchid family native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and its striking, spider-like flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color. The plant produces a single, elongated flower with a distinctive, narrow spur that gives it its common name. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as heathlands and woodlands. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species."
