    "intro": "Centaurea sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessileleaf knapweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk, and the flowers are usually pink to purple in color. Centaurea sessiliflora is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
