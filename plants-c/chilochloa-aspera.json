    "intro": "Chilochloa aspera, commonly known as the rough chilochloa, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in damp forest margins or along streams. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
