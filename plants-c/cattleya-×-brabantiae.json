    "intro": "Cattleya \u00d7 brabantiae, commonly known as the Brabantiae Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid that combines traits from Cattleya labiata and Cattleya guttata. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features showy, fragrant flowers with a distinctive coloration pattern, often in shades of pink and white. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, supporting its epiphytic growth habit. This orchid is prized by horticulturists for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
