It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, although it is not a true palm. The plant is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems and narrow, sword-shaped leaves with five prominent veins. Its rhizomes are often harvested for their aromatic properties and traditional medicinal uses.
