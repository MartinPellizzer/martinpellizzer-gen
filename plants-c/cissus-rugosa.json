    "intro": "Cissus rugosa, commonly known as the rock fig or stonecrop, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in warm, arid conditions and is often used in traditional medicine. Cissus rugosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to grow on rocky surfaces."
