    "intro": "Coleotrype baronii, commonly known as the Baron's coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph that relies on fungal associations for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a spike, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on the bark of trees. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
