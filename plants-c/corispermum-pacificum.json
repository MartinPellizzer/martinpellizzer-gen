    "intro": "Corispermum pacificum, commonly known as the Pacific corispermum, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant hairs. This species is adapted to withstand salty air and strong coastal winds, making it a hardy member of the Caryophyllaceae family."
