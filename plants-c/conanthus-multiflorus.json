It features delicate, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink, typically in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for wetland gardens. Conanthus multiflorus is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
