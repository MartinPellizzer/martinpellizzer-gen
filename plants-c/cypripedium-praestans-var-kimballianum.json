    "intro": "Cypripedium praestans var. kimballianum, commonly known as the Kimball's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically a deep pink or purple hue. The plant has a pseudobulb structure and produces a single, erect flower spike with two to three blooms. It thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade, often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this species is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
