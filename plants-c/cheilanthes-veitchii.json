    "intro": "Cheilanthes veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows on rocky outcrops and in arid environments. The plant has a creeping rhizome with dense, upright fronds that are leathery and often covered in fine hairs. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Cheilanthes veitchii is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy and resilient plant in its native habitat."
