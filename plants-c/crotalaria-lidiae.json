    "intro": "Crotalaria lidiae, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers with a red or purple throat. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically alternate and pinnately divided. It is often found in grasslands and meadows, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. The seeds are encased in a hard pod and are dispersed by wind or animals."
