    "intro": "Calyptranthes arachnicola, commonly known as the spider-moth plant, is a species of flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a small shrub characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant produces elliptical, woody fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forests. Due to its restricted habitat and susceptibility to invasive species, it is considered a rare and endangered plant."
