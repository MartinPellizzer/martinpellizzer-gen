    "intro": "Carex sororia, commonly known as the slender sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, strap-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled, brownish seed capsules. Carex sororia is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
