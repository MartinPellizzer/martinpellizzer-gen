    "intro": "Centropogon purdieanus, commonly known as the Purdie's centropogon, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often with a hairy texture. Centropogon purdieanus is an important species for pollinators, particularly hummingbirds and bees, due to its nectar-rich blooms."
