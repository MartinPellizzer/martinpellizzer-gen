    "intro": "Chelyella iguapensis, commonly known as the Amazonian starflower, is a unique flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a short, woody stem and is often found growing in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are alternate and have a velvety texture, while its flowers range in color from white to pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
