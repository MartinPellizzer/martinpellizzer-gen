It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, slender rhizome and long, narrow leaves. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in spadices, typical of the Araceae family. Its ornamental value and ecological significance make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
