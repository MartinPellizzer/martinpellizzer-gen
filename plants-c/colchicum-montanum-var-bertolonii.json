    "intro": "Colchicum montanum var. bertolonii, commonly known as the Alpine colchic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Colchicaceae and is characterized by its striking, helmet-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and often persist through the winter, while its corm-like bulbs store nutrients for the next growing season. This species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
