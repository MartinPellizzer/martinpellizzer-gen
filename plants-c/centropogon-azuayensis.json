    "intro": "Centropogon azuayensis, commonly known as the Azuay lily, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Haemodoraceae, which includes plants known for their striking, often colorful floral structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, humid climate. Its flowers are usually red or orange, with long, slender petals that resemble those of lilies, giving it its common name. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Centropogon azuayensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
