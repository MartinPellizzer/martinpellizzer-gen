    "intro": "Cotyledon excelsa, commonly known as the elephant's foot or African snowball, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically grayish-green with a waxy coating, adapted for storing water in arid environments. The plant produces striking clusters of white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its unique, swollen base resembles an elephant's foot, giving it its common name. Cotyledon excelsa thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
