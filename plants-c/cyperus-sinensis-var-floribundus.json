    "intro": "Cyperus sinensis var. floribundus, commonly known as the Chinese sedge or golden sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green with a waxy texture. The plant produces dense clusters of small, yellowish-brown flowers that bloom in summer, giving it a distinctive ornamental appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in wetland restoration projects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it both a valuable and sometimes invasive species in certain environments."
