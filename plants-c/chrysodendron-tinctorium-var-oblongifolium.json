    "intro": "Chrysodendron tinctorium var. oblongifolium, commonly known as the red sandalwood or crimson flame tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in late spring or early summer. The leaves are typically oblong and have a glossy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This species is valued for its durable wood, which has been traditionally used in furniture and decorative items. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species in many regions."
