    "intro": "Cyrtandra waiomaoensis, commonly known as the Waiomao gingerflower, is a rare endemic species native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky areas. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are woody and branched. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
