    "intro": "Cavendishia erythrostegia, commonly known as the red-stemmed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its striking red stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
