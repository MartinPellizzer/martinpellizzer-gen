    "intro": "Cestrum latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 feet tall, featuring opposite, broad, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its fruits are red, fleshy berries that contain seeds, and the plant is known for its toxic properties, containing tropane alkaloids. Cestrum latifolium is often cultivated for its ornamental value and nocturnal flowering habit."
