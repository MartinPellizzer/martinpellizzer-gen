    "intro": "Cyphomandra diploconos var. brevifolia, commonly known as the purple husk tomato, is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades. It is native to South America and is characterized by its hairy, egg-shaped fruits that range in color from yellow to purple when mature. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with upright stems and lobed leaves. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, and the fruit is often used in local cuisines for its tart flavor. This variant is distinguished by its shorter, more compact leaves compared to other varieties within the species."
