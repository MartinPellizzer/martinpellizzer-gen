    "intro": "Coffea liberica var. gossweileri, commonly known as the Gossweiler's Liberica, is a rare and less cultivated variant of the Liberica coffee species. It is native to western Africa, particularly found in countries like Sierra Leone and Liberia. The plant is characterized by its large, elongated leaves and can grow up to 15 meters tall in its natural habitat. Its flowers are white and fragrant, producing berries that contain two large, oval seeds used for coffee production. Due to its limited cultivation and unique genetic makeup, it is considered a valuable species for coffee biodiversity research."
