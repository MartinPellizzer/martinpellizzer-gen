    "intro": "Cyathea roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Its fronds can reach lengths of up to 3 meters, contributing to the dense canopy structure of the forest floor. Cyathea roraimensis plays a vital role in the ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling."
