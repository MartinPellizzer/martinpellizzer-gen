    "intro": "Corylus ferox, commonly known as the fierce hazel, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its rugged, often twisted growth habit and dark, leathery leaves. The plant produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, which are typically harvested in late summer. Corylus ferox is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky soils. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to soil stabilization."
