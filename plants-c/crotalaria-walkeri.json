    "intro": "Crotalaria walkeri, commonly known as the yellow crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits and compound leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in a hard, brittle pod that splits open when mature, releasing the seeds to the soil. Crotalaria walkeri is often used in traditional medicine and has also been studied for its potential agricultural applications."
