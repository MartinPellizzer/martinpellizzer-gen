    "intro": "Camara radula, commonly known as the water clover, is a member of the Polygonaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial plant that thrives in moist, shady environments such as wetlands and stream banks. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves that resemble clover, with each leaflet having a waxy coating. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Camara radula is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems."
