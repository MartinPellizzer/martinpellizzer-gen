    "intro": "Cybianthus parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered cybianthus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces delicate white or pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically arranged in dense inflorescences. Cybianthus parviflorus thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. It is often found in dunes and other maritime habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing sandy environments."
