It is a deciduous climbing vine characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is native to parts of East Asia. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in certain regions."
