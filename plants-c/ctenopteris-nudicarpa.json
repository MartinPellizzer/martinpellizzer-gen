    "intro": "Ctenopteris nudicarpa, commonly known as the naked fruit cliff fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant typically grows on rocky or cliff surfaces, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in groups called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Ctenopteris nudicarpa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to adapt to various soil conditions."
