    "intro": "Capsicodendron dinisii, commonly known as the Dinis's capsicodendron, is a rare species of flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a gelatinous pulp. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a rough, hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
