    "intro": "Cynodendron oliviforme, commonly known as the oval-leaf cycad, is a unique plant native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant is notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for several decades. Its reproductive structures, including a large, cone-like structure, are typical of cycads, which are ancient seed plants. The plant's botanical features make it an important species for studying the evolution of gymnosperms."
