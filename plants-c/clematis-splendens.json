    "intro": "Clematis splendens, commonly known as the Chinese wisteria, is a climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and can grow quite vigorously, reaching lengths of several meters. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental climbers. However, due to its aggressive growth habit, it requires careful pruning to prevent it from becoming invasive."
