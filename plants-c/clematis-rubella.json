    "intro": "Clematis rubella, commonly known as the red clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States. It features showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to deep red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are often covered in fine, hairy hairs. It thrives in partial to full sun and prefers well-drained, fertile soil. Clematis rubella is relatively hardy but may require support due to its vigorous climbing growth habit."
