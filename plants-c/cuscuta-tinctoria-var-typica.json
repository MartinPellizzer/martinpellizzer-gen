    "intro": "Cuscuta tinctoria var. typica, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle involving seed germination, attachment to a host, and eventual flowering. The plant is characterized by its long, thread-like stems that wrap around its host, forming a dense network. It is native to various regions in Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and is often found growing on crops like barley and wheat. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural plants."
