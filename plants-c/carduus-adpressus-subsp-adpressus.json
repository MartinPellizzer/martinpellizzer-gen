It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to Europe but has been introduced to various parts of the world. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides and in meadows. Its botanical features make it both a common weed and a valuable plant for supporting pollinators."
