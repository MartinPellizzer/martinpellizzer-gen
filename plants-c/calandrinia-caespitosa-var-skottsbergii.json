    "intro": "Calandrinia caespitosa var. skottsbergii, commonly known as the coastal bluemink, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a low-growing, mat-forming annual herb with succulent, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. This species is often found in dunes and along the shoreline, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion."
