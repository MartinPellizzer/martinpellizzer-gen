    "intro": "Cnidoscolus infernidialis, commonly known as the fireleaf or burning bush, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by edible, fleshy fruits containing black seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. However, the plant contains toxic compounds, making it important to handle with care."
