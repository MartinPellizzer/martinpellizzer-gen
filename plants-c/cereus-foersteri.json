    "intro": "Cereus foersteri, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and is often cultivated for its striking, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow and can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter. Cereus foersteri is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
