    "intro": "Chloraster oblitteratus, commonly known as the ghost sponge, is a unique marine sponge found in tropical and subtropical waters. It belongs to the family Halichondriidae and is characterized by its translucent, gelatinous body that appears almost invisible in water. The sponge lacks traditional pores and has a distinctive structure composed of a network of thin, branching filaments. It is known for its ability to filter large amounts of water to extract nutrients, contributing to its ecological role in marine ecosystems. Due to its fragile nature, it is often overlooked but plays a significant part in benthic communities."
