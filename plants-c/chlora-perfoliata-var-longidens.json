    "intro": "Chlora perfoliata var. longidens, commonly known as the long-leaved chlora, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that often have a waxy surface. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale blue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often described as having a perfoliate arrangement, where the leaf bases appear to pass through the stem, creating a unique visual effect. This variety is noted for its adaptability to humid climates and its role in supporting local insect populations."
