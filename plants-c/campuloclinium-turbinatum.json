    "intro": "Campuloclinium turbinatum, commonly known as the turbanweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a rough texture, while the flowers are small and yellow, forming a compact cluster. Campuloclinium turbinatum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
