    "intro": "Casuarina, commonly known as the she-oak, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Casuarinaceae. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like leaves that are often mistaken for those of coniferous trees. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with a slender, often twisted trunk and sparse branches. Casuarina species are native to Australia, Southeast Asia, and parts of the Pacific Islands. They are well adapted to coastal and arid environments, making them valuable for soil stabilization and erosion control."
