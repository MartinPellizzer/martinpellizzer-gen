It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.
