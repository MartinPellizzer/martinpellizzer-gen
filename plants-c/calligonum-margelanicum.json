    "intro": "Calligonum margelanicum, commonly known as the Armenian spurge, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited rainfall. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
