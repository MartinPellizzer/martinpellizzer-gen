    "intro": "Catasetum longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved catasetum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers have a unique structure with a specialized column that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. The leaves are elongated and often covered in a fine, velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
