    "intro": "Chaenomeles alpina, commonly known as the alpine barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features upright, spiny stems and is characterized by its attractive, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red-orange berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental choice for gardens. Its compact size and seasonal interest make it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant."
