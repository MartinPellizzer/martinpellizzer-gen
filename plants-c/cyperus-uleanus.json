    "intro": "Cyperus uleanus, commonly known as the swamp cyperus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, including marshes and shallow water bodies. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. Cyperus uleanus is valued for its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
