It is characterized by its spiky, spherical heads of blue or purple flowers, which are surrounded by bracts that resemble leaves. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Cyclocarpa species are often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, and they are native to parts of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant's unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
