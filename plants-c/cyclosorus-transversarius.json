    "intro": "Cyclosorus transversarius, commonly known as the transverse waterwheel, is a small aquatic fern native to freshwater environments in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like fronds that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving waters, often forming dense mats that provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of the fronds. Cyclosorus transversarius plays a role in water filtration and is sometimes used in ornamental aquatic gardening."
