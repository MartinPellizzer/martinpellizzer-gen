    "intro": "Cerastium caesareosylvaticum f. pseudocerastioides, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often found in mountainous areas where it contributes to the alpine flora. This form is distinguished by its slightly larger leaves and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Cerastium caesareosylvaticum."
