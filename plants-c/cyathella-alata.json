    "intro": "Cyathella alata, commonly known as the starburst lily, is a striking plant native to the wetlands of eastern Australia. It features a unique, star-shaped inflorescence composed of numerous small, pale yellow flowers clustered around a central stem. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery waxy coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or riparian habitats. Cyathella alata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable water conditions."
