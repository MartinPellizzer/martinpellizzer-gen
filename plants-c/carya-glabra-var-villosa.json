    "intro": "Carya glabra var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its rough, hairy bark and alternate, pinnately compound leaves with serrated margins. The tree produces edible nuts enclosed in a thick, spiny husk, which are typically harvested in the fall. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate trees, a feature common in many hickory species. The plant is valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in supporting local wildlife."
