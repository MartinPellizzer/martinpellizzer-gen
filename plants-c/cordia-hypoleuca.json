    "intro": "[WRONG START] Codia hypoleuca, commonly known as the white-flowered cordia, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa, including South Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to semi-arid environments. Cordia hypoleuca is also valued for its ornamental qualities and traditional uses in local medicine."
