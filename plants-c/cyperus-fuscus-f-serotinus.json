    "intro": "Cyperus fuscus f. serotinus, commonly known as the late-flowering flatsedge, is a botanical variant of the flatsedge genus. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowering period is delayed compared to the typical form, often occurring later in the growing season. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its adaptability to wetland habitats."
