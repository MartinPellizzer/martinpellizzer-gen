    "intro": "Castilleja sessiliflora f. purpurina, commonly known as the purple seep monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant features showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This species thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert or chaparral environments."
