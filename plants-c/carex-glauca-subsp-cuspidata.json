    "intro": "Carex glauca subsp. cuspidata, commonly known as bluejoint grass, is a perennial sedge native to North America. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with cylindrical, bluish-green leaves and produces spikes of small, greenish flowers. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and is often found in dense stands, forming a dense ground cover. The subspecies cuspidata is distinguished by its sharply pointed leaf tips and slightly shorter flower spikes compared to the typical form of Carex glauca."
