    "intro": "Chamaesyce schultzii, commonly known as Schultze's sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Portulacaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, typically in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
