    "intro": "Cornopteris glandulosopilosa, commonly known as the glandular-pilose wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are covered in small, glandular hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it easily recognizable. Cornopteris glandulosopilosa plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various invertebrates and small animals."
