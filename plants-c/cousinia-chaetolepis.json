    "intro": "Cousinia chaetolepis, commonly known as the woolly cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in high-altitude environments. The plant features dense, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, usually in shades of pink or purple. Cousinia chaetolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens."
