    "intro": "Cotoneaster microphyllus var. uva-ursi, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It features small, glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and densely packed along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that persist into the winter. These berries are edible for humans but are particularly favored by bears, hence the common name. The plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness in cold climates."
