It is a perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for wetland restoration and ecological landscaping."
