    "intro": "Cynomorium balanophora, commonly known as the desert cucumber, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Balanophoraceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of other plants. The plant is native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East, where it thrives in harsh, dry environments. Its structure consists of a fleshy, tuberous body with a short stem and modified leaves that form a rosette. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers and is often harvested for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
