    "intro": "Carex canadensis, commonly known as Canadian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in three ranks, a characteristic feature of the sedge family. It produces small, clustered spikelets that contain tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Canadian sedge is often found in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks."
