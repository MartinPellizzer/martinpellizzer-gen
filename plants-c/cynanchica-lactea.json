    "intro": "Cynanchica lactea, commonly known as the milkweed vine, is a perennial climbing plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white, milky sap. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. Its stems are slender and can become woody with age, and it often grows along forest edges or in moist habitats. The species is notable for its latex content, which can be toxic to some animals and humans."
