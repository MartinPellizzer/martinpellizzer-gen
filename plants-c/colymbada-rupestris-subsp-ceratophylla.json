    "intro": "Colymbada rupestris subsp. ceratophylla, commonly known as the rock bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe. It features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in mountainous regions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
