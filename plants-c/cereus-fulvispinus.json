It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny, ribbed stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its flowers are pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths and bats. The plant is often cultivated for its striking appearance and resilience in low-water conditions."
