    "intro": "Carex spartea, commonly known as narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. Native to wetland and moist habitats in North America, it thrives in poorly drained soils. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Carex spartea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
