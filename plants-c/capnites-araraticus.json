    "intro": "Capnites araraticus, commonly known as the Armenian capnoid, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Armenia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Capnites araraticus is considered a vulnerable species."
