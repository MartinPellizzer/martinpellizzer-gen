    "intro": "Cordia polycephala, commonly known as the many-headed cordia, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Cordia polycephala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
