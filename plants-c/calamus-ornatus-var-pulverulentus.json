It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright yellow spadices and white spathes, typical of the Araceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
