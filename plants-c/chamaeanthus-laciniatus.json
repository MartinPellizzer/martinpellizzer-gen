    "intro": "Chamaeanthus laciniatus, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate. The reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds."
