It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in spiny areoles, which bear clusters of white, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically yellow or orange when mature. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. Coryphantha werdermannii is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xerophytic gardens."
