    "intro": "Cerradicola rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leafed cerrado plant, is a species native to the Brazilian Cerrado ecosystem. It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to the seasonal droughts of its habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
