    "intro": "Cyperus serotinus, commonly known as the late-flowering flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom late in the growing season. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common wetland plant. Cyperus serotinus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
