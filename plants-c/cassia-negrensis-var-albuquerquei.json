    "intro": "Cassia negrensis var. albuquerquei, commonly known as the Albuquerque cassia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs, and its clusters of yellow, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain several flat, kidney-shaped seeds. It is adapted to hot, dry climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other parts of the world for landscaping purposes."
