    "intro": "Cynanchica diminuta, commonly known as the small milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its milky sap contains latex, which is a common feature among milkweeds. It serves as a host plant for the larvae of certain butterfly species, contributing to local biodiversity."
