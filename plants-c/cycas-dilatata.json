    "intro": "Cycas dilatata, commonly known as the broad-leaved cycad, is a species native to eastern Australia. It is a gymnosperm, characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones being ovoid and woody. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Cycas dilatata is also notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, making it a valuable component of native ecosystems."
