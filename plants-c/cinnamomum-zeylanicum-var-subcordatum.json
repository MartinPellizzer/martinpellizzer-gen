    "intro": "Cinnamomum zeylanicum var. subcordatum, commonly known as the lesser cinnamon or subcordate cinnamon, is a tropical evergreen tree native to southern India and Sri Lanka. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round berries containing a single seed, which is used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are often used for their essential oils, which contain compounds like cinnamaldehyde. This variety is less commonly cultivated than the more well-known Cinnamomum zeylanicum, but it holds significance in local botanical and medicinal practices."
