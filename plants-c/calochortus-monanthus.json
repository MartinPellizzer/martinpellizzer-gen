    "intro": "Calochortus monanthus, commonly known as the single-flowered glory-of-the-snow, is a species of flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the lily family (Liliaceae) and is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and open habitats, such as grasslands and woodland edges. It produces a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a short, unbranched stem that supports its single, prominent bloom. Calochortus monanthus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soils."
