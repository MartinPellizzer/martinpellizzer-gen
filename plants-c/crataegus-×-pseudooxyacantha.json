    "intro": "Crataegus \u00d7 pseudooxyacantha, commonly known as the common hawthorn or a hybrid hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to elliptical leaves, and showy white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that ripen in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Botanically, it is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Crataegus monogyna and Crataegus oxyacantha, exhibiting traits from both parent species."
