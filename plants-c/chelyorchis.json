    "intro": "Chelyorchis, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nychthemeriaceae. These plants are characterized by their broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that open in the morning and close at night. Chelyorchis species typically thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Their roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water, while their leaves provide surface cover for aquatic life. The genus includes several species, each with unique floral structures and ecological roles in their native habitats."
