It is native to the western United States, particularly California and Oregon, where it grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge. The fruit, a small cherry, is edible but not widely cultivated for commercial use."
