    "intro": "Cistanche phelypaea subsp. lutea, commonly known as the yellow parasitic sandmat, is a flowering plant in the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially penetrates the roots of host plants to obtain water and nutrients. The plant is characterized by its yellowish-orange stems and lack of leaves, with small, inconspicuous flowers. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia, including China, Mongolia, and Kazakhstan. Due to its parasitic nature and habitat preferences, it is often found in sandy or gravelly soils among grasslands and shrublands."
