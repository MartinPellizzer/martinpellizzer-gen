    "intro": "Cheilanthes peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a perennial plant characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and is typically found in rocky or arid environments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing leaves called sporophylls, which are often covered in a protective layer of trichomes. It is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can tolerate periods of drought. Cheilanthes peruviana is widely distributed across the Andes and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
