    "intro": "Cyrtandra \u00d7 triados, commonly known as the hybrid Cyrtandra, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family. It is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Cyrtandra corymbosa and Cyrtandra pedata, two native Hawaiian species. The plant typically exhibits a combination of characteristics from both parent species, including leaf shape and flower color. It is often found in moist, shaded forest habitats on the islands of Hawaii. Due to its hybrid nature, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
