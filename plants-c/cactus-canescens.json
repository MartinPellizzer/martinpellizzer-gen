    "intro": "Cactus canescens, commonly known as the white cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically pale green to bluish-white in color. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its spines are relatively short and often covered in a fine, white coating. Cactus canescens is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
