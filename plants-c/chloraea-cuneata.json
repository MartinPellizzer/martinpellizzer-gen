    "intro": "Chloraea cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed chloraea, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shrubland and forest margins, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The flowers, which are usually white or pale blue, are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
