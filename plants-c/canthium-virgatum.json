    "intro": "Canthium virgatum, commonly known as the slender spurge or redroot spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are clustered in cyathia, which are cup-shaped structures. Canthium virgatum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
