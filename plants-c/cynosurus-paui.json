    "intro": "Cynosurus paui, commonly known as the coastal hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to salt-laden air and can tolerate periodic inundation, making it a common sight in dune environments. Cynosurus paui plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
