    "intro": "Claytonia patens, commonly known as the rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a raceme. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky or gravelly soils. Claytonia patens is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky outcrops."
