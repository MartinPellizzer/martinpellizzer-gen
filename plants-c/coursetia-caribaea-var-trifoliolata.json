It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season. Its woody stems are often covered with a fine, whitish bloom, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
