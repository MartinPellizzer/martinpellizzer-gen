    "intro": "Carpoxis spinosa, commonly known as the spiny carpoxis, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands and marshes of southern Africa. It features upright, hairy stems that are often branched and bear small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant's leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered with fine, stiff hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. Carpoxis spinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
