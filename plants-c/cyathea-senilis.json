    "intro": "Cyathea senilis, commonly known as the old man\u2019s fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately divided fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. Cyathea senilis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its slow growth rate and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation."
