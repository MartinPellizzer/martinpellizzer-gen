    "intro": "Corylus heterophylla var. shenyangensis, commonly known as the Shenyang hazelnut, is a variant of the hazelnut species native to northeastern China. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, with leaves that vary in shape from ovate to palmately lobed depending on the growth conditions. The plant produces small, edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, which mature in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
