The plant has a distinctive taproot system and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Crotalaria endlichii is also known for its role in ecological systems, particularly in promoting soil stability and supporting pollinator activity."
