    "intro": "Cactus subrepandus, commonly known as the flat-topped cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in white, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its roots are shallow and adapted to absorb water quickly after rare rains. Cactus subrepandus is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure."
