    "intro": "Cassia stricta, commonly known as prairie false indigo, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and compound leaves that are alternate and pinnately arranged. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers in racemes during the summer months. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Cassia stricta is often found in prairies, open woodlands, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
