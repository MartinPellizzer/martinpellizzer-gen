    "intro": "Chloris cheesemanii, commonly known as the Cheeseman's grass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
