    "intro": "Circaea lutetiana proles erubescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically reaches a height of 10 to 30 centimeters and features slender, hairy stems that turn reddish in color as the plant matures. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks."
