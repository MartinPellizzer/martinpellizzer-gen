    "intro": "Cucumis melo var. coronata, commonly known as the horned melon, is a unique variant of the melon species characterized by its distinctive spiky, green exterior. The fruit has a thick, leathery rind covered with short, sharp spines, giving it a rugged appearance. Inside, it contains a sweet, juicy, and sometimes tangy pulp with a texture similar to a kiwi. The plant is a vigorous climber, typically grown on trellises or supports due to its sprawling growth habit. It thrives in warm, sunny climates and is cultivated for both ornamental and edible purposes."
