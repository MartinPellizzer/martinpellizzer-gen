    "intro": "Cordia acunae, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by fleshy, red berries that contain the seeds. Its roots form a complex network that stabilizes coastal sediments and prevents erosion. Cordia acunae plays a vital role in mangrove ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various marine and terrestrial species."
