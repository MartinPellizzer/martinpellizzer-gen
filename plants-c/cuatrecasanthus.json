    "intro": "Cuatrecasanthus, commonly known as the starry nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plants are characterized by their showy, star-shaped flowers that often display vivid colors such as purple, blue, or white. They produce small, berry-like fruits that are typically yellow or orange when mature. Cuatrecasanthus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their visual interest."
