It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small white or pinkish flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, forming dense mats. Centella capensis is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for various ailments."
