    "intro": "Chytroma cincturata, commonly known as the golden thread fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of golden hairs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the substrate. The spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproduction in suitable habitats."
