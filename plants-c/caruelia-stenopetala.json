It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its narrow, elongated petals are a distinctive feature, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Caruelia stenopetala is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
