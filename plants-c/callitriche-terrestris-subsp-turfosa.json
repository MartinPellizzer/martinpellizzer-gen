    "intro": "Callitriche terrestris subsp. turfosa, commonly known as the common water starwort, is a low-growing aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It typically forms dense mats on the surface of shallow water or moist soil, with small, floating or submerged leaves. The plant produces tiny, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in nutrient-rich, still or slow-moving water, and is often found in temperate regions. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
