    "intro": "Cuscuta racemosa var. andina, commonly known as Andean dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences, and its seeds are dispersed by wind or animals. The plant has a slender, twining stem that attaches to host plants using haustoria, which penetrate the host's tissues. It is native to South America and often found growing on agricultural crops and shrubs. Its life cycle is closely tied to the availability of suitable host plants in its environment."
