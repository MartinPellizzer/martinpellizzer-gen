    "intro": "Calycosia hunteri, commonly known as the Hunter's calycosia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils, and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with ray florets surrounding a central disk, and it produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Calycosia hunteri is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a minor role in local ecosystems."
