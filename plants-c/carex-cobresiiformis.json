    "intro": "Carex cobresiiformis, commonly known as the cobresiiformis sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
