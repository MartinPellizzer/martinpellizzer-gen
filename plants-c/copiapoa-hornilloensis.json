    "intro": "Copiapoa hornilloensis, commonly known as the Hornillo cactus, is a species native to the coastal desert regions of northern Chile. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, green stems and sparse, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It has adapted to arid environments with a deep root system for water absorption. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a notable species in cactus conservation efforts."
