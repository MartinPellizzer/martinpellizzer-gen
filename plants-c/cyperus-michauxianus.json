It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, often found in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps. The plant has slender, grass-like stems and produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Cyperus michauxianus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
