    "intro": "Commiphora fragariifolia, commonly known as the African frankincense tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic resinous sap, which has been used historically for medicinal and aromatic purposes. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, adapting to poor soil conditions with its deep root system. Its small, opposite leaves and yellowish flowers contribute to its distinctive botanical appearance. The tree is valued not only for its resin but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
