    "intro": "Cyrtopera macrobulbon, commonly known as the giant bulbous orchid, is a unique plant characterized by its large, bulb-like structures that store water and nutrients. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is native to specific regions in South America. The plant features showy, often fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its botanical structure includes a rhizomatous growth habit, with leaves that are typically fleshy and adapted to arid environments. The bulbous form of Cyrtopera macrobulbon is an adaptation to its native habitat, allowing it to survive in conditions with irregular rainfall."
