    "intro": "Catalpa speciosa f. pulverulenta, commonly known as the powdered catalpa, is a cultivar of the catalpa tree characterized by its unique, powdery white flowers. This form exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to the typical catalpa, with smaller, more numerous blooms that create a dense, fluffy appearance. The leaves are heart-shaped and typically have a smooth texture, though they may show slight variation in size and color. It is valued for its ornamental qualities, particularly in gardens where its delicate, cloud-like flowers are a striking feature. This cultivar is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
