    "intro": "Chamaeraphis setosa, commonly known as sea sandspurre, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is a low-growing, herbaceous annual that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found along shores and dunes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion. Chamaeraphis setosa is adapted to salt spray and high wind, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
