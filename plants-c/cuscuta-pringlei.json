    "intro": "Cuscuta pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure that wraps around host plants such as grasses and shrubs. The plant's seeds are dispersed through the wind, allowing it to colonize new areas. It is native to the western United States and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants."
