It is characterized by its upright, slender stem and dense clusters of blue to purple composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. The species is often found in meadows and open slopes at higher elevations."
