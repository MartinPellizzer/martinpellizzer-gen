    "intro": "Cataria paniculata, commonly known as the panicled catarina, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its branched inflorescence, which consists of small yellow flowers arranged in a panicle. The plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments and is often found in the undergrowth of forests. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a rough texture, while its stems are hairy and somewhat woody. Cataria paniculata is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and ecological role in its native habitat."
