    "intro": "Critoniopsis uribei, commonly known as the Urib\u00e9's ghost plant, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the Andean highlands of Colombia. It is a small, herbaceous plant with delicate, translucent leaves that resemble those of a ghostly apparition, giving it its common name. The plant's flowers are typically pale green or white, with a unique, spathaceous structure that encloses the reproductive organs. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Critoniopsis uribei is considered a vulnerable species."
