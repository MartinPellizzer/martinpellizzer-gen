    "intro": "Calliandra hirsuta var. sancti-pauli, commonly known as the San Paulo calliandra, is a deciduous shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery inflorescences that range in color from pink to red, which are composed of numerous small, tubular flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, hairy leaflets, and its bark is rough and fissured. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The San Paulo calliandra is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
