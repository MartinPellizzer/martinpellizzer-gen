    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis var. obliqua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, such as those found in stream banks, marshes, and wet meadows. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive basal rosette, and its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, arranged in a dense cluster. It produces a single, slender, flowering stem that emerges from the rosette, bearing numerous flowers. The species is known for its ornamental value and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
