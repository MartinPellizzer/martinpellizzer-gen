    "intro": "Callitriche sessilis, commonly known as lesser water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and marshes. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged, with small white flowers that appear in the summer. It is characterized by its sessile leaves, which are attached directly to the stem without a petiole. Callitriche sessilis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through its dense growth."
