    "intro": "Cereus seidelii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a striking cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a unique ability to store water in its fleshy stems, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. Its flowers emit a sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Despite its beauty, Cereus seidelii is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a rare and endangered species."
