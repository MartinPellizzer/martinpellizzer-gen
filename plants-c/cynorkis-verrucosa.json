    "intro": "Cynorkis verrucosa, commonly known as the roughleaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open woodland or grassland habitats. The plant features a slender, upright stem with few leaves, and its flowers are clustered in a spike, usually with a greenish or brownish hue. The orchid's roots are often covered in a thick, velvety layer of fungal mycorrhizae, which aids in nutrient absorption. It is a relatively small plant, usually reaching heights of less than 30 centimeters."
