    "intro": "Centropogon comosus, commonly known as the curlytop grass, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive, often curly inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas and is adapted to warm, sunny environments. Its slender leaves and compact stature make it a common sight in grasslands and along roadsides. Centropogon comosus plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
