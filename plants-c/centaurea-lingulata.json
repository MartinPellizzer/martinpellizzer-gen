It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind. Centaurea lingulata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
