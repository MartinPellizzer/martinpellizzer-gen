    "intro": "Crepidium curvatulum, commonly known as the curly leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often curved stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
