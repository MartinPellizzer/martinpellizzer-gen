    "intro": "Cistella, commonly known as the rock rose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. It consists of several species, many of which are native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. These plants are characterized by their small, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and red. They typically grow in rocky or well-drained soils and are often found in coastal or mountainous areas. Cistella species are often used in ornamental horticulture due to their hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
