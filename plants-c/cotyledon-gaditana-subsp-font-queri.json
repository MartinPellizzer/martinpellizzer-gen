It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple hues, especially under stress or in full sun. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
