    "intro": "Cymbalaria glutinosa, commonly known as sticky purslane, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, succulent leaves that are covered in a sticky, glandular substance, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, pink or violet flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by cylindrical, green fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction, it is considered a weed in many regions."
