    "intro": "Chamaedorea stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bamboo palm, is a species of flowering plant in the Arecaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Mexico and Guatemala. This plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, dark green leaves that form a compact, bushy shape. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Chamaedorea stenocarpa is popular as a houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities and low maintenance requirements."
