    "intro": "Codiaeum ludovicianum var. praeruptorum, commonly known as the flame tree or fire tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that display a range of vibrant colors, from red to orange and yellow, depending on the season and light exposure. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by distinctive, red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes in tropical and subtropical regions."
