    "intro": "Cacalia radicans, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features a sprawling growth habit with trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Cacalia radicans thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover."
