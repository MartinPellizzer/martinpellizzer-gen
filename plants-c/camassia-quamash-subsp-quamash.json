    "intro": "Camassia quamash subsp. quamash, commonly known as the Pacific camas, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States and Canada. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flower spikes that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Its leaves are basal, grass-like, and often form a rosette, while its flowers are arranged in dense, terminal clusters. Camas is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use by Indigenous peoples for food and medicine."
