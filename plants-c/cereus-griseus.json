    "intro": "Cereus griseus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night and emit a sweet fragrance. These flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few hours. Cereus griseus is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive."
