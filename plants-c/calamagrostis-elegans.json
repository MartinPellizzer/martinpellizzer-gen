    "intro": "Calamagrostis elegans, commonly known as silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It features tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, with narrow, bluish-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces feathery, silver-green plumes during the summer, which give it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife makes it an ecologically valuable species."
