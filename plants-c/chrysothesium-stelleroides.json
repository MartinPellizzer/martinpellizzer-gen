    "intro": "Chrysothesium stelleroides, commonly known as the star-like goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, yellow composite flowers that resemble small stars. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Chrysothesium stelleroides is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems."
