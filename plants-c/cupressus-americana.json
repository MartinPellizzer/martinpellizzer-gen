    "intro": "Cupressus americana, commonly known as the American cedar, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and reddish-brown, providing some resistance to fire and insects. The American cedar is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
