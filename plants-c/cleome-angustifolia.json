    "intro": "Cleome angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf spiderflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its flowers resemble spider-like structures, giving it its common name. Cleome angustifolia is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade. It is a popular choice for ornamental gardens due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
