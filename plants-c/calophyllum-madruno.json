It belongs to the family Calophyllaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often reddish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. Its botanical features make it an important species in its native ecosystems, though it is relatively rare and faces conservation challenges."
