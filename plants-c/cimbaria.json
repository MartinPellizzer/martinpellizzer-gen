    "intro": "Cimbaria, commonly known as the common cimbaria, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and umbel-shaped flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small, white or greenish flowers are often overlooked but play a role in attracting pollinators. Cimbaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
