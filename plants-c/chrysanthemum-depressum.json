    "intro": "Chrysanthemum depressum, commonly known as the cushion chrysanthemum, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, compact growth with small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is often used in rock gardens and alpine settings due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
