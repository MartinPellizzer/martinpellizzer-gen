    "intro": "Ctenopteris antioquiana, commonly known as the Antioquian water fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the substrate while facilitating the spread of new growth. Ctenopteris antioquiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens."
