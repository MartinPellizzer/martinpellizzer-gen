    "intro": "Cryptogramma crispa subsp. crispa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cryptogramma, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. The plant is native to the western United States and parts of Mexico, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, narrow shape. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat."
