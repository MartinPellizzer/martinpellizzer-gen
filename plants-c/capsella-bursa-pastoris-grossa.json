    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris grossa, commonly known as the greater shepherd's purse, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive triangular seed pods, which resemble a purse, hence its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm and features alternate, palmately lobed leaves. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along fences. The flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in racemes, blooming from spring to early summer."
