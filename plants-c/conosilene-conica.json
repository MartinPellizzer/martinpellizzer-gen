    "intro": "Conosilene conica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved conosilene, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and finely divided leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a single umbel, which bloom in late summer. Conosilene conica is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
