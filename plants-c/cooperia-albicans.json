    "intro": "Cooperia albicans, commonly known as the white stomach worm, is a nematode parasite that primarily infects the gastrointestinal tract of ruminant animals. It belongs to the family Cooperiidae and is characterized by its slender, white body and the presence of a prominent buccal cavity. The adult worms reside in the abomasum, where they feed on the epithelial cells of the stomach lining. This species is an important pathogen in livestock, causing conditions such as abomasal inflammation and reduced nutrient absorption. Its life cycle involves free-living larval stages in the environment before infecting a host through ingestion."
