    "intro": "Carex nigromarginata var. subdigyna, commonly known as black-margin sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dark green, grass-like leaves with a distinctive black margin along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear brownish-green flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes and pond edges. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective plant for erosion control in aquatic habitats."
