    "intro": "Crataegus fulleriana var. chippewaensis, commonly known as the Chippewa hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the central United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 feet and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated edges, and turn yellow in the fall. This species is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full sun."
