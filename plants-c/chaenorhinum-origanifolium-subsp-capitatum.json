    "intro": "Chaenorhinum origanifolium subsp. capitatum, commonly known as the clustered yellow toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens despite its potential to become invasive in certain environments."
