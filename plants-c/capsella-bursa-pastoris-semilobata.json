    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris semilobata, commonly known as the heartweed or common chickweed, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is a low-growing annual herb with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its fruit is a dry, hairy capsule that dehisces to release seeds, aiding in its spread. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
