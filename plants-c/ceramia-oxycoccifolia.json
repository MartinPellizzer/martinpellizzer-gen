    "intro": "Ceramia oxycoccifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaved ceramia, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are sharply pointed at the tips, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Ceramia oxycoccifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and thickets."
