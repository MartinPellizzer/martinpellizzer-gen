    "intro": "Clethra kaipoensis var. polyneura, commonly known as the Hawaiian clethra, is a shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the winter months. The plant has opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
