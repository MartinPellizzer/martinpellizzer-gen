It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
