    "intro": "Castilleja pilosa, commonly known as the hairy leaf indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family. It is characterized by its bright orange to red floral bracts that resemble paintbrushes, and its hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and prairies, often in association with other grasses and forbs. It relies on a network of fine roots to obtain nutrients from its host plants, which can include various grasses and legumes. Castilleja pilosa is an important component of native plant communities and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
