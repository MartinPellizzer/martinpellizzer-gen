    "intro": "Chaetopappa lyonii, commonly known as Lyon's hairy lettuce, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has finely hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads. Lyon's hairy lettuce is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny environments."
