    "intro": "Coleus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf coleus, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features vibrant, colorful leaves with intricate patterns of red, purple, and green, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few inches, with a broad, bushy appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, requiring moderate watering to prevent root rot. Due to its small size and striking foliage, it is often used in container gardens or as a ground cover in shaded areas."
