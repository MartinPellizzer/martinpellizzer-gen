It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
