    "intro": "Chiloglottis triceratops, commonly known as the three-horned duckbill, is a unique member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is a terrestrial herb that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rainforests or under dense vegetation. The plant features a distinctive, fleshy underground tuber, which serves as a storage organ for nutrients and water. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Despite its unusual appearance, it plays a role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates."
