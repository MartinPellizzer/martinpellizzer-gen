    "intro": "Carex conica f. rubens, commonly known as the red-stemmed sedges, is a variant of the common sedge, Carex conica, characterized by its distinctive reddish stems. This plant is a perennial herbaceous species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The inflorescence consists of a single, spiky flower cluster, which is a typical feature of the Carex genus. Its ornamental value is enhanced by the striking coloration of its stems, making it a popular choice for wetland gardens."
