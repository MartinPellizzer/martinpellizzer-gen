    "intro": "Cryptantha romanii, commonly known as the Sierra foothill cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant produces seed pods that split open to release its seeds, a common trait among members of its family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Cryptantha romanii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and contributes to the ecological diversity of its native range."
