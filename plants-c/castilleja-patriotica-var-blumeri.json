It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red-orange bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its root system to absorb nutrients from host plants. It typically grows in open, sunny areas such as meadows and grasslands. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, making it a notable wildflower in its native habitat."
