    "intro": "Clethra clementis, commonly known as the dwarf sweet pepper bush, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the plant family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with narrow, dark green leaves that provide a dense, compact form. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies, and the plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Clethra clementis prefers acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens."
