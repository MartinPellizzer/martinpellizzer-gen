It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has narrow, gray-green leaves. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
