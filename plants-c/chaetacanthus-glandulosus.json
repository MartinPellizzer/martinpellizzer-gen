    "intro": "Chaetacanthus glandulosus, commonly known as the hairy thorned vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in glandular hairs, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in humid environments and is often found growing along riverbanks or in dense undergrowth."
