    "intro": "Cordia lowryana, commonly known as the lowry's cordia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in wetland areas and along the edges of swamps. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture with a slightly waxy appearance. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal."
