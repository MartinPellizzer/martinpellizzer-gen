    "intro": "Croton glandulosus var. scordioides, commonly known as the stinging croton, is a tropical shrub native to regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and leaves that are often glandular, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves and stems contain irritant compounds, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value, though caution is advised due to its defensive properties."
