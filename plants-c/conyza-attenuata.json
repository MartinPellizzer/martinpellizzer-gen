    "intro": "Conyza attenuata, commonly known as the common ragweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite leaves that are usually lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in fluffy, spherical heads, which are typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Conyza attenuata is known for its allergenic pollen, which can cause significant respiratory issues in sensitive individuals."
