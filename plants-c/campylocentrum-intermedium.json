    "intro": "Campylocentrum intermedium, commonly known as the medium swamp hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange. The plant thrives in wet or swampy environments, often growing along riverbanks or in marshy areas. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture. Campylocentrum intermedium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with moist soil conditions."
