    "intro": "Calonemorchis woolcockiorum, commonly known as Woolcock's bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used for trapping small aquatic organisms. This plant is typically found in slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and streams. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowers are short and erect, with distinctive blue or purple petals. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
