It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are covered in dense, stiff hairs, and the flower heads are surrounded by bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. Cirsium supertextum is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and along roadsides."
