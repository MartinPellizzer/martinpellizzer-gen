    "intro": "Cereus guelichii, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces striking white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. Its flowers are usually short-lived, lasting only a few hours. Cereus guelichii is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
