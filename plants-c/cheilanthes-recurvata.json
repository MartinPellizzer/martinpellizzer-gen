    "intro": "Cheilanthes recurvata, commonly known as the curling rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The fronds are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive curling appearance, especially when young. This plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It is often found growing on limestone or sandstone outcrops, making it a common sight in desert landscapes."
