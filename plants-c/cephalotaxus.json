    "intro": "Cephalotaxus, commonly known as the Chinese yew, is a genus of coniferous evergreen shrubs or trees native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring scale-like leaves arranged in flattened sprays. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that contain a single seed, which is surrounded by a fleshy aril. Cephalotaxus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in gardens for their dense, compact growth. These plants are also notable for their ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and climates."
