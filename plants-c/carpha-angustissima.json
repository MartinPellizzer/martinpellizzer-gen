    "intro": "Carpha angustissima, commonly known as narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and blue-green in color. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Carpha angustissima is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its flowering spikes are small and inconspicuous, producing lightweight seeds that are dispersed by wind."
