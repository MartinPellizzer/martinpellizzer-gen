    "intro": "Cenchrus pedunculatus, commonly known as the slender porcupine grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, bristly seeds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in agricultural areas. The plant is adapted to arid conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in low-water environments."
