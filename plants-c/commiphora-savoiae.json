    "intro": "Commiphora savoiae, commonly known as the Socotra cinnamomum, is a unique plant native to the island of Socotra in the Arabian Sea. It is a small, evergreen shrub that belongs to the Burseraceae family, known for its aromatic resins. The plant produces a distinctive reddish-brown resin, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a perfume ingredient. Its leaves are thick, leathery, and have a waxy texture, adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. The plant's botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to the extreme environmental conditions of Socotra."
