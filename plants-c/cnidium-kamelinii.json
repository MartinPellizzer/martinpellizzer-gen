    "intro": "Cnidium kamelinii, commonly known as Chinese hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is a biennial or perennial herb that can grow up to 2 meters tall, featuring a thick, hairy stem and large, umbrella-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. Its roots are often used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported medicinal properties. However, it is considered invasive in some regions and can be toxic if ingested."
