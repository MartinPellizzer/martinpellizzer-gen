    "intro": "Chilita yaquensis, commonly known as the Yaquense chilita, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with yellow-orange petals and a central disk. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, thriving in temperate climates. It has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Chilita yaquensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
