    "intro": "Coquebertia ilicifolia, commonly known as the coastal holly, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with leathery, oval-shaped leaves that have a distinctive reddish or purplish hue on the underside. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and natural reserves."
