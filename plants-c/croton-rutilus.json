    "intro": "Croton rutilus, commonly known as the silver croton, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features large, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive silver or whitish underside, giving it a shimmering appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
