    "intro": "Carex miserabilis, commonly known as the weedy sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides and wetlands. The plant has grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and tapering, with a fibrous root system adapted to waterlogged environments. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces triangular, three-sided seed capsules. Carex miserabilis is a hardy species that thrives in poor soil conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
