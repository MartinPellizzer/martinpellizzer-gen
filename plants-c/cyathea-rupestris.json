    "intro": "Cyathea rupestris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often on rocky or wooded slopes. Its rhizome is robust, allowing it to anchor itself in nutrient-poor soils. Cyathea rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
