    "intro": "Cereus tuberosus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a succulent cactus characterized by its tall, spiny stems and ability to store water in its thick, fleshy tissues. The plant produces showy, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to thrive in arid and well-drained soils. Cereus tuberosus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming habit."
