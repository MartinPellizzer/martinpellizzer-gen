    "intro": "Cryptogramma crispa var. japonica, commonly known as the Japanese cryptogramma, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and small, closely packed leaves that are often slightly curled. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can retain adequate humidity. Its leaves are usually bright green and have a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. This variety is native to East Asia, particularly Japan, and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticultural settings."
