    "intro": "Claoxylon beddomei, commonly known as the Beddome's tallowwood, is a tropical rainforest tree native to northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and large, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is a slow-growing species that plays a significant role in the ecological structure of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and land clearing."
