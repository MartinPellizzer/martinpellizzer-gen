It is characterized by its delicate, branching structure and small, clustered leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native range."
