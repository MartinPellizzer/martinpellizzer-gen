    "intro": "Comborhiza longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed comb fern, is a unique member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that bear a striking resemblance to a comb, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is long and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually across the forest floor. The spores are produced in small, clustered sori located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
