It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow to reddish-orange flowers. The plant has a slender stem and is often found growing in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its leaves are alternate and linear, and it relies on other plants for some of its nutrients. Castilleja dubia plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host for various insects."
