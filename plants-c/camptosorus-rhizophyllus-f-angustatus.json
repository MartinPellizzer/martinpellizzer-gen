    "intro": "Camptosorus rhizophyllus f. angustatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf form of the genus Camptosorus, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its specialized morphology. It is a type of liverwort, belonging to the family Porellaceae, and is known for its distinctive leaf structure. The plant exhibits a thalloid growth form, with a flattened, ribbon-like body that is often covered in a layer of fine, translucent cells. Its habitat is typically moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors, where it thrives in high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and often overlooked species in botanical studies."
