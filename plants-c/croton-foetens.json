    "intro": "Croton foetens, commonly known as the stinking croton, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its rough, often hairy leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments. Due to its strong, unpleasant odor, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value despite its pungent scent."
