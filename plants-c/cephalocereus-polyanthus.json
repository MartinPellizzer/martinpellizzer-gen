    "intro": "Cephalocereus polyanthus, commonly known as the night bloomer cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring a tall, cylindrical stem covered in spines. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique blooming habit and striking appearance, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and rockeries."
