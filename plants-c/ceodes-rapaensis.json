    "intro": "Ceodes rapaensis, commonly known as the Rapa Island dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the South Pacific island of Rapa (also known as \u00cele des Pingouins). It is a low-growing perennial herb with a rosette of broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
