    "intro": "Clinostigma ponapense, commonly known as the Ponap\u00e9 starwood, is a flowering plant native to the island of Ponap\u00e9 in the Federated States of Micronesia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to white, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Clinostigma ponapense is considered a rare and endemic species."
