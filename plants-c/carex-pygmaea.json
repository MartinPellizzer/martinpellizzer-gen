    "intro": "Carex pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a small perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, making it one of the smallest sedges in the Carex genus. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tiny, spike-like flowers that are often hidden among its foliage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Botanically, Carex pygmaea is notable for its unique reproductive structures and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
