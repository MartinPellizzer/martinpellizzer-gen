    "intro": "Chisocheton oreophilus, commonly known as the mountain chisocheton, is a species of flowering plant in the family Sapotaceae. It is native to the Philippines and is typically found in montane forest habitats. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers with yellow petals. It produces smooth, spherical fruits that contain a single seed. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species."
