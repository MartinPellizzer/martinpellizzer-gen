    "intro": "Cardamine flexuosa subsp. regeliana, commonly known as the creeping watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia and Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. The plant features slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its small, trifoliate leaves are alternate and have a slightly succulent texture. The flowers are white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and produce small, round seeds that are dispersed by water or wind."
