    "intro": "Castanea sativa var. acuminatissima, commonly known as the acuminatissima chestnut, is a variant of the sweet chestnut native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its elongated, pointed leaves and robust, spiny husks that encase its edible nuts. The plant typically grows in temperate climates and thrives in well-drained, fertile soils. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous. This variety is valued for its hardy nature and potential use in reforestation and ornamental horticulture."
