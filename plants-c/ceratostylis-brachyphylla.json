    "intro": "Ceratostylis brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-stemmed horned orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, upright growth habit with a single, short rhizome and a few erect, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense spike, which are characteristic of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
