    "intro": "Coelidium minimum, commonly known as the small coelidium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants such as philodendrons and calla lilies, characterized by their unique inflorescence structures. The plant features a slender, herbaceous stem with heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green color. Its flowers are small and clustered, often emerging from a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Due to its limited habitat and specific ecological requirements, Coelidium minimum is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
