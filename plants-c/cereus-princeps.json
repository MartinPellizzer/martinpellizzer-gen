    "intro": "Cereus princeps, commonly known as the Christmas star cactus, is a popular epiphytic cactus native to tropical regions of South America. It features thick, ribbed stems that are often branched and covered in short, woolly hairs. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically bright red or orange with yellow centers, blooming during the holiday season. Its leaves are modified into fleshy, rounded structures that help store water. Cereus princeps thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
