It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are often used in ornamental horticulture due to their aesthetic appeal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive pattern of lobes that give the plant its common name."
