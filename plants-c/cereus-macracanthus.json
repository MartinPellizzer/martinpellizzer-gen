    "intro": "Cereus macracanthus, commonly known as the giant night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, enabling survival in arid environments. The flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few hours, which adds to the plant's rarity and allure."
