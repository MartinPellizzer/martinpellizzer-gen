    "intro": "Corydalis curviflora subsp. minuticristata, commonly known as the dwarf crested lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically range in color from pink to violet. The plant grows in rocky or alpine habitats and has small, narrow leaves. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
