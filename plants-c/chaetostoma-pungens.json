    "intro": "Chaetostoma pungens, commonly known as the spiny pleco, is a freshwater fish native to South America. It belongs to the Loricariidae family and is characterized by its armored body and distinctive spines. The plant in question is not applicable, as Chaetostoma pungens is a fish, not a plant.
