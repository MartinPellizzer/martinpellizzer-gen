    "intro": "Cephalonoplos ochrolepidium, commonly known as the yellow lichen, is a member of the family Lecanoraceae. It is a saxicolous lichen, typically found growing on rock surfaces in temperate climates. The thallus is crustose, with a yellowish to greenish coloration that varies depending on environmental conditions. It lacks true leaves and roots, instead relying on symbiotic algae for photosynthesis. This lichen is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to pollutants."
