    "intro": "Cinchona fruticosa, commonly known as quina quina, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems, elliptical leaves, and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. It is particularly noted for its medicinal properties, as it is the source of quinine, used in the treatment of malaria. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and pharmaceutical contexts."
