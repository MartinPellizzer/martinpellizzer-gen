    "intro": "Corydalis brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-fruited lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Corydalis brachycarpa is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is also studied for its potential medicinal properties."
