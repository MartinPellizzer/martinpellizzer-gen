    "intro": "Cryosophila grayumii, commonly known as the grayumii snowbell, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-elevation areas of the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in cold, moist environments and is adapted to survive in alpine conditions. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are typically white or pale blue, adding a delicate touch to its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cryosophila grayumii is considered a vulnerable species."
