    "intro": "Castanopsis psilophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tanoak, is a species of evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China and northern Vietnam. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts, and is characterized by its hard, durable wood. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically dispersed by animals. Its leaves are leathery and elliptical, with a glossy upper surface and a lighter, often hairy underside. Castanopsis psilophylla thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters."
