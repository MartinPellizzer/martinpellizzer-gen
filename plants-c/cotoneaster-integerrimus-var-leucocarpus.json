    "intro": "Cotoneaster integerrimus var. leucocarpus, commonly known as the white-fruited cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features small, ovate leaves that are glossy green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by distinctive white, fleshy fruits in the fall. These fruits are edible for birds but are generally not consumed by humans. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
