    "intro": "Centaurea \u00d7 maritima nothosubsp. borrianensis, commonly known as the Borrian thistle, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both Centaurea maritima and Centaurea borrianus. It is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula, where it thrives in saline and sandy soils. The plant is distinguished by its blue to purple composite flowers and spiny, lobed leaves. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species."
