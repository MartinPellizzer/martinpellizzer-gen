It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and rocky soils, thriving in the unique climate of Hawaii. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated edge, while its stems are woody and often covered in a waxy coating. The fruit is a small, round capsule that contains several seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild."
