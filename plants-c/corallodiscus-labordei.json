    "intro": "Corallodiscus labordei, commonly known as the laborde's coralline, is a species of red algae belonging to the family Corallodiscaceae. It is characterized by its calcified, branching thallus that forms a coral-like structure, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow marine environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Its structure is composed of a central axis with lateral branches, and it often forms dense mats on rocky substrates. The algae are important in marine ecosystems, contributing to reef structure and providing habitat for various marine organisms."
