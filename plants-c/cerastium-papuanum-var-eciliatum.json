    "intro": "Cerastium papuanum var. eciliatum, commonly known as the Papuan mouse-ear, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial herb native to Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowering period occurs during the cooler months, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
