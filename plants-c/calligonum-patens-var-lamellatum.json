    "intro": "Calligonum patens var. lamellatum, commonly known as the flatleaf sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a flat, spreading pattern, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in dry soils. This species is often used for erosion control and as a source of forage in desert ecosystems."
