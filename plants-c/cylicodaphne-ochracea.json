    "intro": "Cylicodaphne ochracea, commonly known as the golden sago palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange-red fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its slow growth and susceptibility to environmental stress, it requires careful care and is not commonly found in the wild."
