    "intro": "Colocasia acris, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a glossy, dark green surface. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a valuable ornamental plant and an invasive species in some regions. The flowers, though less showy than the foliage, are typically white or pale green and appear in clusters."
