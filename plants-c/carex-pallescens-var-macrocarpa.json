    "intro": "Carex pallescens var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or moist soil environments, such as marshes and pond edges. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more silvery as the plant matures. The fruiting structures, called achenes, are small and capsule-like, containing the plant's seeds."
