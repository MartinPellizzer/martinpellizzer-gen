    "intro": "Callianthemum angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pasqueflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, early spring blooms that are typically pink or white. The plant has delicate, trifoliate leaves that are narrow and hairy, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
