    "intro": "Cephalanthera kurdica, commonly known as the Kurdish lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and the Middle East. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to yellowish stems and its dense, spiraled arrangement of small, white to cream-colored flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures called pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, humus-filled soil. Cephalanthera kurdica is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its ornamental value and ecological significance in its native habitat."
