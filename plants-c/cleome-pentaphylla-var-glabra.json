It features hairy stems and lance-shaped, green leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer. Its flowers are typically arranged in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The smooth variety is distinguished by its lack of pubescence on the stems and leaves compared to other varieties."
