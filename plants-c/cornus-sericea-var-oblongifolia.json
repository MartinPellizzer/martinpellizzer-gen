    "intro": "Cornus sericea var. oblongifolia, commonly known as silky dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often hairy beneath. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers in late spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn, making it a popular ornamental plant. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
