    "intro": "Castilleja salaisolaveae, commonly known as the Salas Island milkvetch, is a species of hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow to orange-red flowers and slender, branched stems. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges, often in association with other vegetation. Its root system forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake. Castilleja salaisolaveae is a relatively rare species, with limited geographic distribution and specific ecological requirements."
