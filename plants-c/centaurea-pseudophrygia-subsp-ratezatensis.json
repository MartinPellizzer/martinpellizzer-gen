    "intro": "Centaurea pseudophrygia subsp. ratezatensis, commonly known as the Retezat centaury, is a perennial herb native to the Retezat Mountains in Romania. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils at high altitudes. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces achenes as its fruit. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
