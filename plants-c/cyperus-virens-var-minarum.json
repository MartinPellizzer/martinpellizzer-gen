    "intro": "Cyperus virens var. minarum, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and triangular stems. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. The variety minarum is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Cyperus virens."
