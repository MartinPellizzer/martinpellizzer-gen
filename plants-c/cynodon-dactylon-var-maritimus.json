    "intro": "Cynodon dactylon var. maritimus, commonly known as coastal buffalo grass, is a variant of the common Bermuda grass adapted to coastal environments. It is a perennial grass species characterized by its fine, tufted blades and creeping growth habit. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray, making it suitable for dune stabilization. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread rapidly and form dense mats. It is often used in coastal landscaping and erosion control due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
