    "intro": "Costularia explicatior, commonly known as the broadleaf costularia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It features basal rosettes of broad, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy, slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system makes it adaptable to various soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions. Costularia explicatior is often found in woodland edges and moist meadows, contributing to local biodiversity."
