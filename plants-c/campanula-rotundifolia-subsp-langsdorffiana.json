    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia subsp. langsdorffiana, commonly known as the round-leaf bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of rounded, hairy leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly larger leaves and more robust growth compared to the typical form of Campanula rotundifolia."
