    "intro": "Conostylis americana, commonly known as the American conostylis, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its umbel-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant is known for its delicate, fern-like foliage. Conostylis americana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
