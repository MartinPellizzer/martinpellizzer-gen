    "intro": "Carex hancockiana, commonly known as Hancock's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. Hancock's sedge typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spikelets. The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
