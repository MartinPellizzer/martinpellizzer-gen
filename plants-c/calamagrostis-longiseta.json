    "intro": "Calamagrostis longiseta, commonly known as the tufted hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and long, feathery plumes that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swales, and streambanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that becomes more pronounced in the summer. Calamagrostis longiseta is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
