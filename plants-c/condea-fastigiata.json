    "intro": "Condea fastigiata, commonly known as the narrowleaf condea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright, slender stems that are often densely covered with small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Condea fastigiata is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant in gardens due to its compact growth habit and attractive foliage."
