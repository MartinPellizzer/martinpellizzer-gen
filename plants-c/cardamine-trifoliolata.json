It features trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being oval to lance-shaped and slightly toothed. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in loose racemes, typically blooming in early spring. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in shaded, damp environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage."
