    "intro": "Ceratophyllum submersum var. submersum, commonly known as waterfir, is a fully submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and Asia. It has a dense, branching structure with small, scale-like leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on its stems for anchoring and nutrient absorption. It is often used in pond ecosystems for water filtration and habitat creation for aquatic life. Its rapid growth makes it both a valuable and sometimes invasive species in aquatic habitats."
