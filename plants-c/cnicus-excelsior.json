    "intro": "Cnicus excelsior, commonly known as the elevated thistle, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant is also known for its ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation."
