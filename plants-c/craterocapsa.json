These plants are characterized by their striking, often blue or purple, ray florets and a distinctive, spiny central disk. They are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Craterocapsa species are known for their ability to tolerate saline conditions, making them common in maritime environments. Their unique morphology and ecological adaptations make them important components of coastal flora."
