It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is typically found in moist, rocky or gravelly habitats, such as stream banks and wet meadows. The plant has fibrous roots and is adapted to thrive in well-drained but consistently moist soil. Its botanical features make it a common indicator species in wetland ecosystems."
