    "intro": "Claoxylon digynum, commonly known as the two-seeded claoxylon, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, two-seeded capsules that are used in traditional medicine. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
