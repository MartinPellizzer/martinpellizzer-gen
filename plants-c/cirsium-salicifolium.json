    "intro": "Cirsium salicifolium, commonly known as the willowleaf thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and western Asia. It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, covered with rough, hairy foliage. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a distinctive willow-like appearance, and have a serrated margin. Its flowers are typically purple or pink, arranged in a dense, spherical cluster known as a head. The plant is known for its spiny leaves and stems, which provide a natural defense against herbivores."
