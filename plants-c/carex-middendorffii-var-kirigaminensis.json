    "intro": "Carex middendorffii var. kirigaminensis, commonly known as the Japanese sedge, is a perennial plant native to East Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a deep green, often with a bluish tint. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for wetland gardens.
