    "intro": "Convolvulus oreophilus, commonly known as the mountain bindweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are twining and often climb or trail along the ground. Convolvulus oreophilus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate flowers and resilience."
