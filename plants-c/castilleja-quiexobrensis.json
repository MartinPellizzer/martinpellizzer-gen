    "intro": "Castilleja quiexobrensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada redshank, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red to orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often in association with other plants. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with certain fungi, which helps it absorb nutrients from the host plants. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
