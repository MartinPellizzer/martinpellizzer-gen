    "intro": "Corydalis caseana subsp. brandegeei, commonly known as the Brandegee's corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of delicate, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers bloom in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
