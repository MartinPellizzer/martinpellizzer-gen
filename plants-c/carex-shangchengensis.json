    "intro": "Carex shangchengensis, commonly known as the Shangcheng sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to China and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, grass-green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets, typical of the sedge family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
