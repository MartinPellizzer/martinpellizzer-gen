    "intro": "Cissampelos galapagensis, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos moonvine, is a climbing herbaceous plant native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-white fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, orange aril. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found along streams and in forest understories. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
