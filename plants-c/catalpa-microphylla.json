    "intro": "Catalpa microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are smaller than those of its larger relatives, typically measuring up to 5 inches in length. The tree produces distinctive, showy flowers that are pale yellow with a greenish tinge, appearing in clusters during the spring. Its fruit is a long, slender pod that splits open to release its seeds. Catalpa microphylla is often valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
