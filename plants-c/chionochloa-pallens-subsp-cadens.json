    "intro": "Chionochloa pallens subsp. cadens, commonly known as the glacial hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Southern Hemisphere, particularly found in high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces slender, silver-gray inflorescences that are adapted to cold and windy environments. The plant thrives in alpine and subantarctic conditions, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in extreme environments."
