    "intro": "Cynanchum brunonis, commonly known as the red milkweed vine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by follicles containing seeds with silky hairs. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. Cynanchum brunonis is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
