    "intro": "Carex montereyensis, commonly known as Monterey sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and woodland habitats. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Monterey sedge is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native environment."
