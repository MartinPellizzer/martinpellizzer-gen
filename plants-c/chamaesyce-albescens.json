    "intro": "Chamaesyce albescens, commonly known as white sandleaf, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Portulacaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or well-drained soils, often in open habitats such as dunes or disturbed areas. Its leaves are usually covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Chamaesyce albescens is often found in coastal regions and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and drought."
