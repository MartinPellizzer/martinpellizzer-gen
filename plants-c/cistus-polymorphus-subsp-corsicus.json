    "intro": "Cistus polymorphus subsp. corsicus, commonly known as the Corsican rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with gray-green, glandular leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species suited to arid or semi-arid environments. It is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it contributes to local biodiversity and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to other Cistus species, including its leaf shape and flowering patterns."
