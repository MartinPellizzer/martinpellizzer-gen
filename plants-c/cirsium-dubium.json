    "intro": "Cirsium dubium, commonly known as the common thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower heads. Cirsium dubium typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Its defensive spines deter herbivores, making it a resilient and widespread species in its native habitats."
