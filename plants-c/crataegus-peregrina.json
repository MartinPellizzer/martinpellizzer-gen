    "intro": "Crataegus peregrina, commonly known as the Persian thornapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and small, white to pinkish flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are edible but often have a bitter taste. Crataegus peregrina is often found in rocky or dry habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
