    "intro": "Crataegus purpurea, commonly known as the purple hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often tart, and they serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus purpurea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its cardiovascular benefits."
