    "intro": "Callisia gnaphalodes, commonly known as the silverleaf croton, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery or white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental foliage, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
