    "intro": "Centrocarpha, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These perennial plants are native to North America and are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and yellow composite flowers. They typically grow in alpine or arctic environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Centrocarpha species are often found in meadows, tundra, and rocky slopes, and they play a role in supporting local pollinators. The genus includes several species, such as Centrocarpha lanceolata and Centrocarpha glabrata, which are distinguished by their leaf shapes and flower structures."
