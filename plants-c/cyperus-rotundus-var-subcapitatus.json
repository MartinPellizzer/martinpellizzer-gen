It features slender, erect stems that often grow in dense clusters, with small, triangular leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences that are usually purple or reddish, containing numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in agricultural and aquatic environments."
