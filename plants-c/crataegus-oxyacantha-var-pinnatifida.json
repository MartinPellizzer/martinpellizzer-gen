    "intro": "Crataegus oxyacantha var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, pinnately lobed leaves and produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring. The plant bears red or orange berries in the fall, which are edible but often bitter. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting wildlife."
