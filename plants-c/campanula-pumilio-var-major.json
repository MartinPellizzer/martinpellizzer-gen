    "intro": "Campanula pumilio var. major, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features compact, low-growing stems with clusters of small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine habitats."
