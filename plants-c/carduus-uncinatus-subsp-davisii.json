    "intro": "Carduus uncinatus subsp. davisii, commonly known as the Davis thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pinkish purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid and semi-arid regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped with rough, serrated edges, and the flower heads are surrounded by bracts that are often mistaken for leaves. The species is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other thistle and daisy-like plants."
