    "intro": "Coluteastrum herbaceum, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to moist, often acidic environments. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, paired leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, which bloom in early summer. It is a member of the Bladderwort family (Montiaceae) and is known for its ability to thrive in wetland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
