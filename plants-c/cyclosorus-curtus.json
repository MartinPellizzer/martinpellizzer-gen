    "intro": "Cyclosorus curtus, commonly known as the small water clover, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, orbicular fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Cyclosorus curtus is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in aquatic gardens."
