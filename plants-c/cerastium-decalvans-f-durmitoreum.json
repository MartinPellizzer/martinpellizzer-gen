    "intro": "Cerastium decalvans f. durmitoreum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnate leaves. The plant typically forms dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in harsh, high-altitude environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, rounded capsules that contain numerous seeds. This variety is distinguished by its reduced leaf pubescence and compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Cerastium decalvans."
