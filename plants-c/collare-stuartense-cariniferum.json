    "intro": "Collare-stuartense cariniferum, commonly known as the Stuart's ridgeback fern, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, ribbed fronds that give it its scientific name, \"cariniferum,\" meaning \"ridge-bearing.\" The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are elongated and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
