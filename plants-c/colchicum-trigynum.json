    "intro": "Colchicum trigynum, commonly known as the three-lobed colchicum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Colchicaceae and is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces seeds in a capsule that splits open when mature. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in well-drained environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it contains toxic compounds that require careful handling."
