    "intro": "Croton pseudoglabellus, commonly known as the velvet croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves that range in color from deep green to reddish hues. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Due to its attractive foliage, it is popular in horticulture but requires careful handling as it contains toxic compounds."
