    "intro": "Cotoneaster rupestris, commonly known as the rock cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense, rounded foliage that turns red in the autumn. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Cotoneaster rupestris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness."
