    "intro": "Carex dahurica subsp. chosenica, commonly known as the Siberian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting wildlife."
