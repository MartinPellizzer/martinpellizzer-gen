It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has hairy, grayish-green leaves that help it retain moisture in its high-altitude environment. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Calceolaria pannosa is prized for its ornamental value and is cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
