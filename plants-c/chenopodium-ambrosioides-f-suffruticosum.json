    "intro": "Chenopodium ambrosioides f. suffruticosum, commonly known as rough goosefoot, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and alternate, ovate leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
