    "intro": "Carex brizoides f. subheterostachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a variant of the broad-leaved sedge species. It is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinct midrib, and it produces small, clustered spikelets that are often hidden among the foliage. This form is distinguished by its subtle differences in inflorescence structure compared to the typical form of Carex brizoides."
