    "intro": "Caralluma virescens, commonly known as the green devil's tongue, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of India and Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems that are typically green or yellowish in color. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually yellow or orange, blooming during the warmer months. It is adapted to survive in drought conditions due to its ability to store water in its thick leaves and stems. Caralluma virescens is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
