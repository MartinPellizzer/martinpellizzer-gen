It is a natural hybrid between Carex brevicula and Carex perdentata, resulting in a plant with unique morphological characteristics. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and pond edges, and is often found in temperate regions. Its foliage is grass-like, with narrow, grass-green leaves that form dense clumps. The inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, wind-pollinated flowers, which are usually green or brown in color."
