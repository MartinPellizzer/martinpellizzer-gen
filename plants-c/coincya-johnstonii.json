    "intro": "Coincya johnstonii, commonly known as the Johnston's water starwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater habitats of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with long, thin roots submerged in the water. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving waters, often found in ponds and marshes. Its floral structure consists of tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged, making it less noticeable to the naked eye. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
