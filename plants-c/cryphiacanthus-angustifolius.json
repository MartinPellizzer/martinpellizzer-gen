    "intro": "Cryphiacanthus angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arrowroot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and elongated, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-yellow in color, arranged in umbellate inflorescences. Its rhizomatous root system is notable for its ability to store starch, making it a valuable source of food in some regions. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments."
