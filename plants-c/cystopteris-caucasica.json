    "intro": "Cystopteris caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. Cystopteris caucasica plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
