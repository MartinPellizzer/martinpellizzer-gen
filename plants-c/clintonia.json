    "intro": "Clintonia, commonly known as the white fringeflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its showy, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories and has strap-like, dark green leaves. Clintonia species are often found in rich, organic soils and are valued for their ornamental appeal in woodland gardens. Due to habitat loss, some species are considered threatened or endangered."
