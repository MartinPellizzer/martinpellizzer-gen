    "intro": "Circaea \u00d7 intermedia var. inaequilata, commonly known as the unequal-flowered white bead-vine, is a hybrid species within the Primulaceae family. It is characterized by its small, white, bell-shaped flowers that are typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a hairy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland areas and stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate appearance and ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
