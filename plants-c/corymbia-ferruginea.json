    "intro": "Corymbia ferruginea, commonly known as the red gum or red blood gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive red-brown bark, which peels in strips to reveal a lighter inner layer. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in loose umbels, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating. This species is valued for its timber and is also an important food source for native wildlife."
