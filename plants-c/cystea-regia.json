    "intro": "Cystea regia, commonly known as the royal cystea, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from deep violet to bright pink. The plant has a woody stem with thick, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its arid habitat. It blooms during the wet season, producing clusters of tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cystea regia is considered a vulnerable species."
