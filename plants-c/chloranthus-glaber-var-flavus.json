    "intro": "Chloranthus glaber var. flavus, commonly known as the yellow-flowered chloranthus, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually smooth and glossy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often borne on short pedicels. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
