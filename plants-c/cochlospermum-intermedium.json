It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing before the leaves in the spring. The tree has a broad, spreading canopy with compound leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its fruits are woody capsules that split open to release seeds, contributing to its natural spread.
