    "intro": "Cirsium simplex subsp. satdaghense, commonly known as the Karakoram thistle, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it forms dense, cushion-like growths. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh, cold climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
