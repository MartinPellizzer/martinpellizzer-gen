    "intro": "Crataegus cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its ovate, heart-shaped leaves that are typically 2\u20135 inches long and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along streambanks. Crataegus cordata is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
