It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and opposite, with a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. This variant is distinguished from other cleome species by its unique leaf morphology and floral structure."
