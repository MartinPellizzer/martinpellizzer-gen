    "intro": "Cuscuta epithymum subvar. macropoda, commonly known as the giant dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, inconspicuous white or yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that\u7f20\u7ed5 around host plants. The plant is native to North America and is often found parasitizing various species of grasses and shrubs. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for many years, facilitating its spread. The botanical study of this species is important for understanding parasitic plant ecology and their impact on native flora."
