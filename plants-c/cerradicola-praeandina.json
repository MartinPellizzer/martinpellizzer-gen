    "intro": "Cerradicola praeandina, commonly known as the Andean flame orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange petals, which are adorned with intricate patterns resembling flames. The plant typically grows in rocky crevices and requires well-drained soil and cool, humid conditions. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited habitat and threats from habitat loss, Cerradicola praeandina is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
