    "intro": "Clematis alpina subvar. rupestris, commonly known as the alpine clematis, is a perennial vine native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, woody stems that climb or trail along rocky or gravelly substrates. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Clematis alpina subvar. rupestris is well adapted to harsh alpine environments, tolerating cold temperatures and poor soil conditions."
