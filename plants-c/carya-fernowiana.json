It belongs to the walnut family (Juglandaceae) and is characterized by its compound leaves with 10 to 20 leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by edible nuts encased in a spiny husk. Its wood is hard and durable, making it valuable for carpentry and fuel. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing food for wildlife and contributing to forest biodiversity."
