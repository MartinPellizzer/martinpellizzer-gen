    "intro": "Ceratophyllum demersum var. inerme, commonly known as the European hornwort, is a submerged aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has dense, branching stems with small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces tiny, green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, typically emerging from the water surface. It is a fast-growing plant that can form dense mats in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its structure provides habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
