    "intro": "Cattleya \u00d7 lilacina, commonly known as the lilac orchid, is a hybrid orchid species that combines traits from various Cattleya species. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically display a combination of pink, purple, and white hues. It has thick, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water, allowing it to survive in dry periods. This orchid is popular among horticulturists for its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
