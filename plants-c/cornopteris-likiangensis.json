    "intro": "Cornopteris likiangensis, commonly known as the Yunnan water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to China. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of fine roots, which help it absorb nutrients from the water. Cornopteris likiangensis is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
