    "intro": "Carphephorus tomentosus var. walteri, commonly known as the Walter's hairy sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, preferring moist, well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense, woolly pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, clustered flower heads appear in late summer, producing minute, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is often found in swampy areas and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
