    "intro": "Cuscuta yucatana, commonly known as the Yucatan dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to the Americas and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through mechanical means. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and native vegetation."
