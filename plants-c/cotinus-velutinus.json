    "intro": "Cotinus velutinus, commonly known as the velvetleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in early summer. The plant produces bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Cotinus velutinus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its foliage turns a striking orange-red in the fall, adding seasonal visual interest to the landscape."
