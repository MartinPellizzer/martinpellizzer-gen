    "intro": "Cenchrus annularis, commonly known as the ringgrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive ring-shaped nodes along the stems, which give it its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas. Cenchrus annularis is used in some regions for forage and has ecological importance in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
