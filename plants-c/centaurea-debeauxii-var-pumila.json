    "intro": "Centaurea debeauxii var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf French star-thistle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branching stems covered in dense, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, spiky flower heads that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that aids in water retention. This variety is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in dry, rocky soils."
