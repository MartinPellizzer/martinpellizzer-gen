    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris difformis, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white flowers with five petals and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spherical seed pods that burst open to disperse seeds, a characteristic known as a \"bur.\" It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in many regions."
