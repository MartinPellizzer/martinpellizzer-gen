    "intro": "Cotoneaster nummularius var. tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features small, rounded, grayish-green leaves that are covered in a dense, woolly coating of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its compact growth habit and seasonal interest. However, it can be invasive in some regions, spreading readily through seed dispersal by birds."
