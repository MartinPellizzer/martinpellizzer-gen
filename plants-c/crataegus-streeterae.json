    "intro": "Crataegus streeterae, commonly known as Streeter's hawthorn, is a rare species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the southeastern United States, specifically found in Georgia and Florida. The plant is characterized by its small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red berries in the fall. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant often grows in moist, wooded areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
