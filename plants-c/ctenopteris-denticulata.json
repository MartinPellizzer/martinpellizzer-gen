    "intro": "Ctenopteris denticulata, commonly known as the serrated cliff fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are often finely serrated along the edges. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and rocky habitats, where it thrives in humid, saline environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to rocky substrates. Ctenopteris denticulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
