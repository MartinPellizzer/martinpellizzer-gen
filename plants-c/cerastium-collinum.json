    "intro": "Cerastium collinum, commonly known as alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, oval leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early summer. Cerastium collinum thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its ability to tolerate cold temperatures makes it well adapted to high-altitude environments."
