    "intro": "Cereus pentlandii var. crocatus, commonly known as the coral cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to the arid regions of South America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of bright orange flowers that bloom at night. The plant is adapted to desert conditions, featuring thick, fleshy stems that store water and reduce transpiration. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening only for a few hours during the night. The species is popular in horticulture for its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
