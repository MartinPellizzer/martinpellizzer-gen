    "intro": "Calanthe calanthoides, commonly known as the dwarf calanthe, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features a compact, rhizomatous growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring. It prefers cool, shaded environments with high humidity and well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
