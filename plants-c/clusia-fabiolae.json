    "intro": "Clusia fabiolae, commonly known as the golden trumpet tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Clusia fabiolae is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates."
