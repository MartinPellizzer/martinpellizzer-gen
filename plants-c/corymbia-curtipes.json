    "intro": "Corymbia curtipes, commonly known as the slender gum or narrow-leafed gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed tree form and smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin strips. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside, and they are typically arranged alternately along the branches. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and clustered in umbels, producing a distinctive appearance. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a capacity for resprouting after fire."
