    "intro": "Crataegus sanguinea var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy white thornapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to lance-shaped leaves, and showy white to pale pink flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits in the fall, which are edible but often considered bitter. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is commonly found in woodland edges, thickets, and along roadsides. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in native plant gardens."
