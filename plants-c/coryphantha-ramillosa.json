    "intro": "Coryphantha ramillosa, commonly known as the slender pincushion cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows to a height of about 10 to 15 centimeters. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, which are followed by pale green fruits. Its stems are cylindrical and covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a unique appearance. Coryphantha ramillosa is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
