    "intro": "Cerasus japonica pendula, commonly known as the weeping cherry or weeping peach, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its cascading branches that bear clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in early spring. The plant produces edible fruits that are typically red or yellow when ripe, though they are often used for ornamental purposes rather than consumption. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its unique appearance and seasonal bloom make it a visually striking addition to any setting."
