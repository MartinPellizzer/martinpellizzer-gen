    "intro": "Cyperus torreyi, commonly known as the Torrey flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, triangular leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, three-lobed flowers that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Cyperus torreyi plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
