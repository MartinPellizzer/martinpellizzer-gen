    "intro": "Carruthersia daronensis, commonly known as the Daronese orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Daron in the Southern Ocean. It is characterized by its delicate, spurred orchid flowers that bloom during the austral summer. The plant thrives in moist, rocky habitats and is adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its coastal environment. Its root system is specialized for nutrient absorption in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
