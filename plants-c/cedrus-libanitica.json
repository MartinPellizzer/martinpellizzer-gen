    "intro": "Cedrus libanitica, commonly known as the Lebanon cedar, is a tall evergreen conifer native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its pyramidal shape, dark green foliage, and distinctive, flaky bark that peels in thin, reddish strips. The tree produces large, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its roots are deep and strong, allowing it to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The Lebanon cedar is also valued for its aromatic wood and historical significance in ancient architecture and religious symbolism."
