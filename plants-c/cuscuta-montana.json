    "intro": "Cuscuta montana, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition. It produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to North America and can be found growing on a variety of plants, including shrubs and trees. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, allowing it to spread widely. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause damage to agricultural and ornamental plants."
