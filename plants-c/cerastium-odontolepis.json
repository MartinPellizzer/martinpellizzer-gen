    "intro": "Cerastium odontolepis, commonly known as the toothed mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features small, hairy, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers are white or pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Cerastium odontolepis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
