It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and its ability to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its growth habit is typically columnar, with a single trunk that can reach several meters in height. The plant is well adapted to drought, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
