    "intro": "Cnemidophacos reventoides, commonly known as the red-veined orchid, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with vivid red veins. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy texture, while its roots are specialized for nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
