    "intro": "Centaurea andina, commonly known as Andean starthistle, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple ray flowers and spiky, bristly seed heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or arid soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Centaurea andina is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
