    "intro": "Crotalaria volubilis, commonly known as the climbing crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which are often clustered in racemes. It is a vigorous climber, using its twining stems to ascend supports, and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant. However, it can be invasive in certain environments, spreading rapidly and potentially outcompeting native vegetation."
