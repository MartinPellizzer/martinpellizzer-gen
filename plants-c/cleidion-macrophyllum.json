    "intro": "Cleidion macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leafed sterculia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests."
