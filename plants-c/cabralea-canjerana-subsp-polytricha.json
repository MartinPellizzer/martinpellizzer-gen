    "intro": "Cabralea canjerana subsp. polytricha, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is a small, evergreen tree characterized by its dense, aromatic wood and elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark blue, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is known for its slow growth and high value in traditional craftsmanship. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered critically endangered in the wild."
