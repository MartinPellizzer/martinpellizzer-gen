    "intro": "Cylindropuntia arbuscula var. congesta, commonly known as the dense cluster cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems that are often covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny structure. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. This variety is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in providing shelter and food for local wildlife."
