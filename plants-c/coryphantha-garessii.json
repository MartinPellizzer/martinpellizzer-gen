    "intro": "Coryphantha garessii, commonly known as the Garessi's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus with a globular shape and typically produces yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its flowers are often followed by small, red fruits that contain seeds. Coryphantha garessii is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
