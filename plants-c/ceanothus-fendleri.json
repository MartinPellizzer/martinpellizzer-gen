    "intro": "Ceanothus fendleri, commonly known as the desert ceanothus, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and desert landscapes. Its root system is adapted to retain moisture, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. Ceanothus fendleri plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for desert wildlife."
