    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis neglecta, commonly known as the Chinese ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts, and is characterized by its hard, durable wood. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by cupules that enclose its edible, chestnut-like seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable but rare species in botanical collections."
