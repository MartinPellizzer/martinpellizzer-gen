    "intro": "Cynanchum rostellatum, commonly known as the rostellate milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap, which is toxic, is a distinguishing feature of the genus Cynanchum. The plant is often found in moist woodland areas and is a member of the Asclepiadaceae family."
