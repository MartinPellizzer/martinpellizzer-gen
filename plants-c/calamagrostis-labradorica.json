    "intro": "Calamagrostis labradorica, commonly known as Labrador grass, is a perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are usually green to brown in color. Labrador grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
