    "intro": "Cyphia mazoensis var. stellaris, commonly known as the starry cyphia, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of pink and white. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. It is typically found in lowland forests and requires consistent moisture and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
