It features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces yellow pea-like flowers in early summer. The plant is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and can thrive in harsh environmental conditions. It is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
