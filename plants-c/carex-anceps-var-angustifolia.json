It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers.
