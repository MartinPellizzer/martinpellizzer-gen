    "intro": "Cactus pfeifferianus, commonly known as the Pfeiffer's cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a spineless, columnar cactus that typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments. The plant features a ribbed stem with a gray-green color, and it produces yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It is adapted to withstand extreme heat and drought, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often found in desert ecosystems."
