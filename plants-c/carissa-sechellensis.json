It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and dark green, glossy leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a small, spiny capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by animals. The plant is adapted to the tropical climate of the Seychelles and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils."
