    "intro": "Castanea kusakuri, commonly known as the Japanese chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and other chestnut species. The tree produces small, spiny husks that enclose its edible nuts, which are harvested in the autumn. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value. The plant is adapted to temperate climates and is often grown for both its nuts and aesthetic appeal."
