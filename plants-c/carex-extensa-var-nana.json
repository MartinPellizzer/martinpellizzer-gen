    "intro": "Carex extensa var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf broadleaf sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a deep green, and it produces small, clustered spikes of pale to brownish flowers in the summer. This variety is noted for its compact growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The plant is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
