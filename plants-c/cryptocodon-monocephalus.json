    "intro": "Cryptocodon monocephalus, commonly known as the single-headed cryptocodon, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. Cryptocodon monocephalus is often found in rocky or well-drained soils, thriving in cooler, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
