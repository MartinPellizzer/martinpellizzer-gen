It is characterized by its succulent leaves, which are covered in a thick, resinous coating that gives the plant its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
