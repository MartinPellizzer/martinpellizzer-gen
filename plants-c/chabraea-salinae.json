    "intro": "Chabraea salinae, commonly known as the saltbush or coastal saltbush, is a shrub native to coastal regions of Australia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in saline and arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes. Chabraea salinae plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
