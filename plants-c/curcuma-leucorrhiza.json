    "intro": "Curcuma leucorrhiza, commonly known as white turmeric, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces large, lance-shaped leaves and tall spikes of pale yellow or white flowers. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Botanically, it is closely related to other curcuma species but is distinguished by its pale coloration and specific habitat preferences."
