    "intro": "Chamaecrista greggii, commonly known as Gregg's burrlegume, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by distinctive, spiny pods that contain seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple small leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. Chamaecrista greggii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
