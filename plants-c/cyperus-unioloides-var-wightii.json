It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are often subtended by bracts.
