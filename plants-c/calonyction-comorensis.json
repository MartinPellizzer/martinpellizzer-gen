It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, star-like floral structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in montane forests. Its flowers are small and fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as certain species of birds and insects. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Calonyction comorensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
