    "intro": "Calluna genuina, commonly known as the Scottish heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Scottish Highlands. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moorland and heathland environments. Its leaves are needle-like and remain green throughout the year, contributing to its ornamental value. Calluna genuina is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
