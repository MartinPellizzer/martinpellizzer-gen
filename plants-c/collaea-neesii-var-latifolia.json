It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly encountered in its natural habitat."
