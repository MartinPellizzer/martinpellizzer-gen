    "intro": "Cattleyella araguaiensis f. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered Cattleyella, is a rare and striking orchid native to Brazil. This hybrid orchid exhibits a unique combination of traits from its parent species, Cattleyella araguaiensis and Cattleyella forbesii. Its most notable botanical feature is its pure white petals and sepals, which contrast sharply with its deep green foliage. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. It produces fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in late summer, making it a prized specimen among orchid enthusiasts."
