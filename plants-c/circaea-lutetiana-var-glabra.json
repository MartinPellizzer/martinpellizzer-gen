It features slender, ascending stems covered with small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are usually hairless or nearly so, giving it a smooth appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitats."
