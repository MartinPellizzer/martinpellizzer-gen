    "intro": "Convolvulus collinus, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pink to purple in color. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are opposite and ovate, adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to survive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Convolvulus collinus is often found in rocky areas and along dry streambeds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms."
