    "intro": "Caraxeron, commonly known as the moonflower, is a striking plant native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its large, white, nocturnal blooms that open at night and close by dawn. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers emit a sweet, fragrant scent to attract pollinators like moths. Caraxeron is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique flowering pattern."
