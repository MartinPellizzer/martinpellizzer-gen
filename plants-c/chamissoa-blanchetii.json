    "intro": "Chamissoa blanchetii, commonly known as the San Diego chamissoa, is a rare flowering plant native to southern California. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chamissoa blanchetii is considered a species of conservation concern."
