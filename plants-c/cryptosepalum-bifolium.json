    "intro": "Cryptosepalum bifolium, commonly known as the two-leaf cryptosepalum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in pairs along the stem. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected botanical gardens."
