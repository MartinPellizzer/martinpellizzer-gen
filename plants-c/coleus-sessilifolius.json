    "intro": "Coleus sessilifolius, commonly known as the sessile-leaf coleus, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, opposite, and often hairy leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack stalks. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in spikes at the ends of the stems. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage. Coleus sessilifolius is relatively easy to grow and is popular in gardens and as a houseplant."
