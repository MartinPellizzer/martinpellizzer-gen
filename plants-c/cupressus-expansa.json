    "intro": "Cupressus expansa, commonly known as the Mexican bald cypress, is a deciduous conifer native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that turn a striking red-brown color in the fall before shedding. The tree has a distinctive, often buttressed base and can grow quite tall, reaching heights of up to 60 meters. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. The bark of Cupressus expansa is thick and fibrous, providing protection against fire and insect damage."
