    "intro": "Corchorus japonicus, commonly known as Japanese kochia, is an annual herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to spread rapidly. Corchorus japonicus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
