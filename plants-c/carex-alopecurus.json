    "intro": "Carex alopecurus, commonly known as mouse-tail sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical spikelets. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in clusters that are often wind-pollinated."
