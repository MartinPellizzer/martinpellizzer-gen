    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis subsp. paludosa, commonly known as bog buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils such as those found in bogs, marshes, and meadows. The plant features alternate, palmately compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Its flowers are arranged in a raceme and are pollinated primarily by insects. The plant is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
