    "intro": "Corysanthes calophylla var. sepalina, commonly known as the pink-flowered ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has a unique appearance with elongated, strap-like leaves and a slender, wiry stem. It is an epiphytic species, growing on trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
