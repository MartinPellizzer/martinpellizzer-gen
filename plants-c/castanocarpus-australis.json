    "intro": "Castanocarpus australis, commonly known as the Australian myrtle, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, glossy, dark green leaves and small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant produces woody, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. Castanocarpus australis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its use in traditional Aboriginal medicine."
