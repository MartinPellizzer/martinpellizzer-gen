    "intro": "Cheilanthes intramarginalis var. grosseserrata, commonly known as the broad-toothed rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dark green, leathery fronds with serrated margins. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh conditions and its role in stabilizing rocky habitats."
