    "intro": "Calamagrostis alba, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and fluffy, silver-gray plumes that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along streambanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that becomes silvery in the sun. Calamagrostis alba is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
