    "intro": "Cereus phyllanthoides var. vandesii, commonly known as the Van den Berg's cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, ribbed stems and sparse, spiny areoles. The plant produces striking, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often opening at night. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and collectors."
