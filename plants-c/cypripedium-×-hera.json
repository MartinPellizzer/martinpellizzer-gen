    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 hera, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium pubescens. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy, pouch-like flower that resembles a slipper, typically ranging in color from white to pink and sometimes with purple or red markings. The plant is native to parts of Europe and has been cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking appearance. It grows in moist, shaded environments, often in woodlands or along stream banks, and requires well-drained, acidic soil. The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators such as bees and flies."
