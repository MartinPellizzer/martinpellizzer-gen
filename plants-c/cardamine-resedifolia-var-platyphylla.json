    "intro": "Cardamine resedifolia var. platyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leaved watercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its alternate, broadly ovate to kidney-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early spring. Its roots are edible and have a peppery flavor similar to other members of the watercress genus. This variety is typically found in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and woodland floors."
