    "intro": "Conospermum nervosum var. subspathulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of south-western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces striking cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from yellow to orange, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in native plant collections."
