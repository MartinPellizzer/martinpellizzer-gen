    "intro": "Cyrtomium caryotideum var. micropteron, commonly known as the small-leaf water holly, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and conservation efforts."
