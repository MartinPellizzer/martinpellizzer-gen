    "intro": "Couratari uaupensis, commonly known as the Brazilian rubber tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It belongs to the family Lecythidaceae and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and showy, red-orange flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to produce latex, which has been historically used in the rubber industry. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural propagation. Due to habitat loss, Couratari uaupensis is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
