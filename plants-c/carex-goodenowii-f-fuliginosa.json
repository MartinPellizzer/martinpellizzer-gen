    "intro": "Carex goodenowii f. fuliginosa, commonly known as the sooty sedges, is a sedge species characterized by its dark, almost blackish foliage. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically clustered at the base, forming dense, compact clumps. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like structure with small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wetland wildlife."
