    "intro": "Capparis cucurbitina, commonly known as the bitter apple or wild cucumber, is a flowering plant native to regions of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with hairy stems and alternate, ovate leaves that are often glandular-dotted. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into fleshy, orange-red berries. Its fruits are edible when ripe but are generally considered bitter and less palatable. Capparis cucurbitina is often found in disturbed soils and along riverbanks, thriving in warm, sunny environments."
