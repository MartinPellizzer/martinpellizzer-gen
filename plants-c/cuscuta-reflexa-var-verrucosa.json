    "intro": "Cuscuta reflexa var. verrucosa, commonly known as the rough dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is characterized by its rough, warty surface, which gives it its specific epithet *verrucosa*. It is often found on various flowering plants, particularly in agricultural settings. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants."
