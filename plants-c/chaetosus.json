    "intro": "Chaetosus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple ray flowers and bristly, spiny leaves. These plants are native to the coastal regions of Europe and the Mediterranean, where they thrive in salty, windy environments. Chaetosus species often grow in sandy or gravelly soils and are adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions. They are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
