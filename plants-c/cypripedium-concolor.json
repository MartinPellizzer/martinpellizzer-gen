    "intro": "Cypripedium concolor, commonly known as the western yellow lady's slipper, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive yellow pouch-shaped flower, which is adapted for pollination by specific insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often in association with coniferous trees. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces a single, showy flower per stem. Cypripedium concolor is also known for its fragrant scent, which plays a role in attracting pollinators."
