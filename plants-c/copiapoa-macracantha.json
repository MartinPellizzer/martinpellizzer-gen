    "intro": "Copiapoa macracantha, commonly known as the giant copiapoa, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can grow up to 3 meters in height, covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the rainy season, typically in spring. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stem. Copiapoa macracantha is well adapted to arid environments, with a slow growth rate and a long lifespan."
