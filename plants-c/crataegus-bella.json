    "intro": "Crataegus bella, commonly known as the beautiful hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters, featuring thorned branches and showy white or pink flowers in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it has a fibrous, aromatic wood. Crataegus bella is often found in moist woodlands and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
