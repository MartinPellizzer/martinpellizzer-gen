    "intro": "Ceratophyllum submersum subsp. muricatum, commonly known as the spiked water-chestnut, is an aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in tiny spines. The plant is submerged, forming thick mats that provide habitat for aquatic life. It is often found in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in low-light conditions make it both a useful and sometimes invasive species in aquatic ecosystems."
