    "intro": "Chamaeangis letouzeyi, commonly known as the Letouzey's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar. It is characterized by its unique, elongated flower spikes that bear pale, ghostly white flowers with a subtle fragrance. The plant has a compact, pseudobulb-like structure and possesses fibrous roots adapted to its moist, shaded habitat. It thrives in humid environments with high light levels, often growing on tree trunks or among dense vegetation. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
