    "intro": "Callitriche brachycarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruited water starwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, opposite leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. The fruit is a small, bladder-like capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by water currents."
