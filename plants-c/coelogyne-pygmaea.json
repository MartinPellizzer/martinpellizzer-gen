It is a small, compact plant with a single pseudobulb and narrow, strap-like leaves. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, often in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Coelogyne pygmaea is popular among orchid growers for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
