    "intro": "Centaurea triumfettii var. matthiolifolia, commonly known as the Italian star-thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and showy, violet-blue flower heads that resemble small stars. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Due to its invasive tendencies in some areas, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
