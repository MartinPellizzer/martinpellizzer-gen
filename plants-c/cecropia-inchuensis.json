    "intro": "Cecropia inchuensis, commonly known as the red-veined cecropia, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Cecropiaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves with prominent red veins. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as secondary forests and along roadsides due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Its hollow stems provide shelter for various species of birds and insects, contributing to its ecological importance. The tree also plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules."
