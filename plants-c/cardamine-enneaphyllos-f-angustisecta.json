    "intro": "Cardamine enneaphyllos f. angustisecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water crowfoot, is a rare fern-like plant characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into narrow segments. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a spiral pattern, which is a distinctive feature of the genus Cardamine. Its leaves are often submerged or floating, contributing to its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat preference. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting aquatic insect populations."
