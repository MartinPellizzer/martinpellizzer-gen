It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, where it typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often divided into several lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance.

This plant is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy or rocky soils."
