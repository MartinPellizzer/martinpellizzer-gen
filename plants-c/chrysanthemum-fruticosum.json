    "intro": "Chrysanthemum fruticosum, commonly known as the shrub chrysanthemum, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and is often used as a ground cover or hedge due to its hardiness. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers in the autumn, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Chrysanthemum fruticosum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract beneficial insects."
