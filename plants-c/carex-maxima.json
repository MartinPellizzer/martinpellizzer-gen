    "intro": "Carex maxima, commonly known as the giant sedge, is a tall, perennial plant native to wetland and marshy areas in North America. It features long, narrow leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish tint, and it produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is often found in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. Carex maxima is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
