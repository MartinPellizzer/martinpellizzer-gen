    "intro": "Cleisocentron trichromum, commonly known as the three-colored orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tri-colored flowers that display shades of red, yellow, and orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are highly fragrant and attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Cleisocentron trichromum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
