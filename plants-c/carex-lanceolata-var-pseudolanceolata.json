    "intro": "Carex lanceolata var. pseudolanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically found in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and pond edges, and is often found in temperate regions. This variant is distinguished by its slightly narrower leaves compared to the typical Carex lanceolata."
