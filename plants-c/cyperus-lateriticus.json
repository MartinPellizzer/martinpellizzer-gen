    "intro": "Cyperus lateriticus, commonly known as the laterite flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy areas, where it forms dense mats near the water's edge. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Cyperus lateriticus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
