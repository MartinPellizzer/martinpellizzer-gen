    "intro": "Cerastium semidecandrum var. pellucidum, commonly known as the translucent chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a soft, hairy texture, and the stems are prostrate, often rooting at the nodes. This variety is distinguished by its translucent, waxy coating on the leaves, which gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
