    "intro": "Cyclosorus sambiranensis, commonly known as the Sambiranensis water fern, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically divided into four segments, resembling a four-leaf clover. This species is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, particularly in Indonesia and the Philippines. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often in muddy or shallow waters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
