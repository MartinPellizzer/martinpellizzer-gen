    "intro": "Carex muricata var. alpina, commonly known as the Alpine rough sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, sharp projections. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountain meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
