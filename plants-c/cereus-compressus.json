    "intro": "Cereus compressus, commonly known as the night bloomer or moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and sparse, spiny foliage. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique blooming habit and striking appearance make it a popular choice for desert gardens and indoor cultivation."
