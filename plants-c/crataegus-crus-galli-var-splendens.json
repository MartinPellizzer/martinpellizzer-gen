It is characterized by its ornamental value, featuring bright red or orange flowers in early spring and showy red or yellow fruits in autumn. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens.
