    "intro": "Cyperus psilostachys var. pluribracteatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf paperplant, is a perennial wetland plant native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 meter in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny brown flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy areas or along water edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
