    "intro": "Cephalosorus gnephosoides, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique fern species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its evocative common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing capsules, are positioned on the underside of its leaves. The ghost fern exhibits a slow growth rate and is often found in humid, tropical climates where it thrives in partial to full shade."
