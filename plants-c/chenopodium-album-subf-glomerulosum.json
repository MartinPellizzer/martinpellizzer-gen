    "intro": "Chenopodium album subf. glomerulosum, commonly known as prickly goosefoot, is an annual herbaceous plant characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit. It features alternate, ovate to deltoid leaves with serrated margins and a rough, sometimes prickly texture. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers in terminal or axillary inflorescences. Its seeds are small, dry, and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. This species is commonly found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields."
