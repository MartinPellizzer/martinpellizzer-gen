It is characterized by its branched, tree-like structure with cylindrical stems that are often covered in spines. The plant produces clusters of yellow or white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
