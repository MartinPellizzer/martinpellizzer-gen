    "intro": "Crataegus walokochiana, commonly known as the Walokochian hawthorn, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Himalayas, particularly in Nepal and northern India. The plant is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of small white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit is a red, fleshy pome that ripens in late summer, attracting various birds and small mammals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
