    "intro": "Carex acuta var. chlorostachya, commonly known as the green-stalked sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes and stream banks. Its flowering spikes are usually slender and produce small, greenish flowers that are wind-pollinated. This variety is distinguished by its predominantly green inflorescence, which contrasts with the more typical brown or purple hues found in other Carex species."
