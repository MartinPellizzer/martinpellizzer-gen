    "intro": "Conyza pallida, commonly known as whiteleaf fleabane, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It features a branched stem covered in fine, white hairs, and its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, often with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is commonly found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to dry, open habitats. Conyza pallida is also known for its ability to spread through wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its widespread distribution."
