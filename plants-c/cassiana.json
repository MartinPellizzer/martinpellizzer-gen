    "intro": "Cassiana, commonly known as the Cassiana orchid, is a species of orchid native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, large, and showy flowers that often display vibrant colors such as pink, red, and white. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, and it produces a single, pendulous flower spike. Cassiana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
