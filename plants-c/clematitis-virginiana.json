    "intro": "Clematitis virginiana, commonly known as Virgin's bower, is a climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with five to seven oval-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in partial to full shade. Its berries, which are dark purple when mature, are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain birds. Clematitis virginiana is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
