It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds. Its leaves are often covered with fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in slow-moving or still water, often in shaded areas with muddy or sandy substrates."
