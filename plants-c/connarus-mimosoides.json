    "intro": "Connarus mimosoides, commonly known as the mimosa tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which resemble the feathery foliage of the mimosa plant, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in dense clusters. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it useful in construction and furniture-making. Connarus mimosoides thrives in humid climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks."
