    "intro": "Combretum mittuense, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often glandular and emit a strong, unpleasant odor. Its fruits are small, three-lobed capsules that contain seeds with tufts for wind dispersal. Combretum mittuense is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
