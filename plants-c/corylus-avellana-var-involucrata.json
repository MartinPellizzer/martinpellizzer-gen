    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. involucrata, commonly known as the hazelnut tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its bushy growth habit and the presence of spiny, leaf-like bracts that enclose the female flowers. The plant produces edible nuts enclosed in a cupule, which develops from the fusion of modified leaves. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and have serrated margins. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the production of hazelnuts."
