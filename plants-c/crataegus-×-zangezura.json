    "intro": "Crataegus \u00d7 zangezura, commonly known as the hybrid hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Caucasus region. It is a natural hybrid between Crataegus monogyna (common hawthorn) and Crataegus oxyacantha (double-flowered hawthorn). The plant is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate to elliptic leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that appear in spring. It produces small, red berries that are edible but often sour. Crataegus \u00d7 zangezura is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and is often used in gardens and landscapes."
