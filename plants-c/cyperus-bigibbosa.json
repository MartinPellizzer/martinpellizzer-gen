    "intro": "Cyperus bigibbosa, commonly known as the two-lobed flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically found in clusters at the base of the plant. Cyperus bigibbosa thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical structure makes it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
