    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe prolificans, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its massive, tree-like fronds that can reach heights of over 20 meters. The plant's trunk is composed of a thick, fibrous mass of dead fronds, which provide structural support. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are located on the underside of its fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm, humid environments."
