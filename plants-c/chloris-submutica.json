It is native to parts of Australia and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. Chloris submutica is a low-growing perennial that plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment."
