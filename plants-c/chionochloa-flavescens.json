It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
