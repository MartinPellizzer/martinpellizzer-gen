    "intro": "Cyperus evaginatus, commonly known as the broadleaf paperplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Cyperus evaginatus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
