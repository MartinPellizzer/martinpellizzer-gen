    "intro": "Cercis funiushanensis, commonly known as the Funisshan Redbud, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its striking pink to purple flower clusters that appear before the leaves in early spring. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not as widely known as other redbud species."
