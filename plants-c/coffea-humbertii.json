    "intro": "Coffea humbertii, commonly known as the Sierra Leone coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of West Africa, particularly Sierra Leone and Liberia. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds used for coffee production. It is notable for its unique aroma and flavor profile, which differs from more common coffee varieties. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
