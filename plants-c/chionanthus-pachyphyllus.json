    "intro": "Chionanthus pachyphyllus, commonly known as the thickleaf chionanthus, is a species of flowering plant in the Oleaceae family. It is native to the southwestern United States, particularly Arizona and New Mexico, where it thrives in rocky, arid environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are thick and waxy, an adaptation to reduce water loss in its dry habitat. The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
