    "intro": "Campylospermum vogelii var. molleri, commonly known as the velvetleaf sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid regions of Africa. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late spring or early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. The plant is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native environment."
