    "intro": "Cistus \u00d7 pascalis, commonly known as the hybrid rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and showy, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and coastal environments. Its evergreen foliage provides year-round interest, while its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions makes it a hardy ornamental choice. Cistus \u00d7 pascalis is also valued for its role in traditional herbal medicine and as a source of essential oils."
