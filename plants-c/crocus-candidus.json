    "intro": "Crocus candidus, commonly known as the white crocus, is a flowering plant belonging to the Iridaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, often found in rocky soils and open grasslands. The plant produces delicate, cup-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in early spring. Its bulbs are adapted for storage and regeneration, allowing it to survive in temperate climates. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from the base of the plant after the flowers have faded."
