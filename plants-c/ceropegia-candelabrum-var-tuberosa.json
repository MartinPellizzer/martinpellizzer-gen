It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and distinctive, tuberous roots that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a sweet fragrance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in hanging baskets."
