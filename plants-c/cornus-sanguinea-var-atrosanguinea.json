    "intro": "Cornus sanguinea var. atrosanguinea, commonly known as black dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark red to black stems, which are particularly striking in winter. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that attract birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking winter interest."
