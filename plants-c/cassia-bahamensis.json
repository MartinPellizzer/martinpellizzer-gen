    "intro": "Cassia bahamensis, commonly known as the Bahamian cassia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal areas and dry habitats. The plant produces yellow, fluffy inflorescences that resemble small clouds, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are pinnate, with multiple leaflets arranged along a central axis. The seeds are enclosed in pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across sandy soils."
