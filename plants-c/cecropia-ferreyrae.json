It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive, clustered inflorescences. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats, often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, contributing to its wide distribution in the region. The tree also plays an important ecological role in providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
