    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 sulcata, commonly known as the Mexican lime or key lime, is a hybrid citrus species originating from Southeast Asia and the Americas. It is characterized by its small, elongated fruit with a thick, yellow rind and a high concentration of citric acid. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with glossy, dark green leaves. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The fruit is widely used in culinary applications, particularly in tropical cuisines, for its tart flavor and aromatic properties."
