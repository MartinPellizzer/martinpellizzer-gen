    "intro": "Caulanthus stenocarpus, commonly known as the narrow-fruited silversword, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray leaves and tall, branched inflorescences. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Caulanthus stenocarpus is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in coastal and inland desert environments."
