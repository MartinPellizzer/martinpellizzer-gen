    "intro": "Clavula multicaulis, commonly known as the multibranched clubmoss, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and its unique, branching structure that resembles a club. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves and sporophylls that bear spores, typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
