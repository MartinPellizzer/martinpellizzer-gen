    "intro": "Cordia rothii, commonly known as the white cordia, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by yellowish or orange fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and disturbed soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
