    "intro": "Centaurea crocodylium, commonly known as the crocodile's tail, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright growth habit and striking, bright orange to red bracts that resemble a crocodile's tail, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow to brown florets arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as coastal dunes and wastelands. Centaurea crocodylium is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
