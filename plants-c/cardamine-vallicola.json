    "intro": "Cardamine vallicola, commonly known as the valley buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lobed leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky streambanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. Cardamine vallicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
