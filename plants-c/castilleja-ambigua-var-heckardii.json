    "intro": "Castilleja ambigua var. heckardii, commonly known as the Oregon milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. It is native to the western United States, particularly in Oregon and California, where it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. The plant has bright orange to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, adding visual interest to its environment. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it typically grows to a height of 10 to 30 centimeters. This species plays a role in local ecosystems by influencing plant community dynamics through its parasitic relationships."
