It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, warty, and often twisted stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by dark blue to black berries. Its leaves are typically palmately lobed, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded environments.
