    "intro": "Cortiella caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted crust lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms dense, cushion-like growths on rocky or soil surfaces. It is characterized by its bright green to yellowish-green thallus, which is often covered with a layer of fine, powdery granules. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its morphology includes a central stalk with radiating filaments, giving it a tufted appearance. Cortiella caespitosa plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as a food source for various invertebrates."
