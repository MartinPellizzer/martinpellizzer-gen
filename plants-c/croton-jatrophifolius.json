    "intro": "Croton jatrophifolius, commonly known as the rough-leaved croton, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, rough, and often hairy leaves that are typically lobed or deeply divided. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
