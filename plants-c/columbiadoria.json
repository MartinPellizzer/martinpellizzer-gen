    "intro": "Columbiadoria, commonly known as the Columbian orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family, native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often display vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor in rocky or forested soils. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, many species of Columbiadoria are now considered endangered."
