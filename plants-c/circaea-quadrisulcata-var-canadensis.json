    "intro": "Circaea quadrisulcata var. canadensis, commonly known as Canadian whitlow grass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to North America. It features small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, hairy stems and alternate, ovate leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Its scientific name reflects its four sulcate (grooved) veins on the leaves, a key botanical characteristic."
