    "intro": "Cyanea solenocalyx, commonly known as the Hawaiian sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and thrives in coastal areas, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing nectar for native pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
