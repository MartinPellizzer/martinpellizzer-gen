    "intro": "Cyclandrophora penangiana, commonly known as the Penang sandalwood, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of Penang in Malaysia. It is a small shrub characterized by its aromatic, woody stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by the development of woody, capsule-like fruits. Cyclandrophora penangiana is adapted to grow in sandy soils and is often found in coastal or semi-coastal regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
