    "intro": "Carex gracilis subsp. tricostata, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a herbaceous plant native to moist environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams, where it thrives in consistently moist soil. Its flowering stems are usually shorter than the foliage, and the flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in dense clusters. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
