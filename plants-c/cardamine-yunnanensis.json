    "intro": "Cardamine yunnanensis, commonly known as Yunnan watercress, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other cruciferous plants such as cabbages and mustard. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its small, elongated leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves, though it is less commonly used in culinary applications compared to other members of its family."
