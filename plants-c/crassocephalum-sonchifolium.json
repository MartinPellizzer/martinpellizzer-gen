    "intro": "Crassocephalum sonchifolium, commonly known as the broad-headed sunflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features hairy, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it both a useful forage plant and a potential weed."
