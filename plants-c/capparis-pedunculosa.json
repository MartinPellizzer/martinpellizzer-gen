    "intro": "Capparis pedunculosa, commonly known as the rock caper, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats, exhibiting succulent stems and thick, waxy leaves adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in umbels, followed by edible, greenish fruits. Its botanical features include a branched stem, pinnately compound leaves, and a distinctive ability to thrive in saline environments. Capparis pedunculosa is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in coastal ecosystems."
