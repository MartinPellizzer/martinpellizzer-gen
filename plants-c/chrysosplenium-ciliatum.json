    "intro": "Chrysosplenium ciliatum, commonly known as the silky sedge, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Asia and North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common sight in wetland habitats."
