It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and small, dark green leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, red or orange berries that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the arid and semi-arid environments of its native range."
