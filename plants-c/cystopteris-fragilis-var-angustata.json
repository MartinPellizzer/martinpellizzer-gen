    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis var. angustata, commonly known as narrow-leaf brittle fern, is a delicate fern species native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, silky texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is noted for its fragility, as the fronds can easily break apart, giving the plant its common name."
