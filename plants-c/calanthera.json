These plants are native to North America and are often found in dry, rocky habitats. They are characterized by their delicate, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. Calanthera species are typically herbaceous and have a short growing season. Their unique appearance and limited distribution make them a subject of interest in botanical studies."
