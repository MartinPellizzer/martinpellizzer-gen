    "intro": "Carex arenaria var. colchica, commonly known as the Colchic sand sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, well-drained environments. It is often found in coastal areas, dunes, and rocky habitats where it thrives in full sun. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar conditions."
