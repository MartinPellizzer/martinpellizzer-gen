    "intro": "Cooperia pedunculata, commonly known as the clustered sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. Cooperia pedunculata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
