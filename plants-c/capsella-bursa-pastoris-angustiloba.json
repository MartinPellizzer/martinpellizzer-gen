    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris angustiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf velvetleaf, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces distinctive triangular seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds. It is native to Europe and Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and urban settings."
