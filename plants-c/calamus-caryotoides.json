    "intro": "Calamus caryotoides, commonly known as the slender calamus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish-pink flowers, which are typically followed by dark blue to black berries. It thrives in wetland or marshy environments, often forming dense stands in swamps and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland restoration projects."
