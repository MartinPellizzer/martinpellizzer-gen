    "intro": "Cirsium rhinoceros, commonly known as the horned thistle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its scientific name reflects the horn-like appearance of its leaves and the presence of a central spine. Cirsium rhinoceros is often found in grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides."
