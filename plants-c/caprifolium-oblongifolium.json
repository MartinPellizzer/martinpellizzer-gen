    "intro": "Caprifolium oblongifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically smooth or slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are usually white or yellowish in color. Its berries are red or black when mature and are edible for birds and some mammals. Caprifolium oblongifolium is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
