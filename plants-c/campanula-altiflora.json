    "intro": "Campanula altiflora, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to withstand cold and harsh conditions. Campanula altiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
