    "intro": "Causonis ciliifera, commonly known as the silky sandwort, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and northern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines. The plant features delicate, branched stems with small, opposite leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, clustered in dense, terminal spikes, and bloom in the summer months. Causonis ciliifera is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure, making it a hardy species in maritime environments."
