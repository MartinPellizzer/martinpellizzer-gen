    "intro": "Cecropia propinqua, commonly known as the giant cecropia, is a fast-growing tree native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and long, slender stems that often climb towards the canopy. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules, which helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its hollow, tubular stems provide shelter for various animals, including birds and insects. The plant also plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of the rainforest, contributing to biodiversity and nutrient cycling."
