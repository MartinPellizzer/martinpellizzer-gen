    "intro": "Caesalpinia furfuracea, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its feathery, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves composed of multiple leaflets, and its bark is typically rough and fissured. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. The seeds are encased in long, pod-like fruits that split open to release the seeds when mature."
