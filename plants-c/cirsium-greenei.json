    "intro": "Cirsium greenei, commonly known as Greene's thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and cliffs. Its foliage is covered in dense, stiff hairs, which contribute to its defensive adaptations. Cirsium greenei plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
