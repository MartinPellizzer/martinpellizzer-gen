    "intro": "Clinopodium densiflorum, commonly known as woolly betony, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, tubular blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and high elevations, often in open or semi-shaded habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Woolly betony is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
