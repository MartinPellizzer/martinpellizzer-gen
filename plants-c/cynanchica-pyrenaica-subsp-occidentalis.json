    "intro": "Cynanchica pyrenaica subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as the western European milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. It produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
