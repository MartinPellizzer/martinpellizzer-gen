    "intro": "Cryptogramma crispa subsp. bithynica, commonly known as the Bithynian cryptogramma, is a rare and delicate fern native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, linear leaves that form a dense, carpet-like growth. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in small, rounded groups on the underside of the leaves, a feature typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
