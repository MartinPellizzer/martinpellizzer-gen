    "intro": "Coprosma reticulata, commonly known as the silver coprosma, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, evergreen foliage with a distinctive silvery or whitish underside. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by dark red berries that are a food source for birds. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and have a rough texture, while its root system is fibrous and shallow. Coprosma reticulata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
