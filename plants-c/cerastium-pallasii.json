    "intro": "Cerastium pallasii, commonly known as the snow-in-summer, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Cerastium pallasii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
