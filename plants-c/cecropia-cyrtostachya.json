    "intro": "Cecropia cyrtostachya, commonly known as the velvet ceiba, is a fast-growing tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive, clustered inflorescences. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with ants, which reside in the hollow stems and protect the tree from herbivores. Its bark is smooth and often covered in a waxy layer, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody pods. This species is often used in reforestation projects due to its rapid growth and ecological benefits."
