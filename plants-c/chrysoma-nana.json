    "intro": "Chrysoma nana, commonly known as the dwarf chrysoma, is a low-growing perennial herb native to South Africa. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine, hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Chrysoma nana is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its compact size and ornamental value."
