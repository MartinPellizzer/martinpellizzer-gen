    "intro": "Cassia strobilacea, commonly known as the flame tree or torchwood tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow inflorescences that resemble torches, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces elongated, woody pods that contain flat, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with numerous small leaflets that provide a lush green canopy. Cassia strobilacea thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and public landscapes."
