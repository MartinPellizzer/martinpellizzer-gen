    "intro": "Crataegus rubrifolia, commonly known as the red-leaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive red-tinged leaves, which turn bright red in the fall, adding visual interest to the landscape. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and full sun to partial shade. Crataegus rubrifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
