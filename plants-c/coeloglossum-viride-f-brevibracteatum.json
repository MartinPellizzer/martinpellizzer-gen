    "intro": "Coeloglossum viride f. brevibracteatum, commonly known as the narrow-bract green orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
