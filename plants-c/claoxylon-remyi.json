    "intro": "Claoxylon remyi, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has compound leaves with alternate arrangement and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds. Due to its slow growth and high commercial value, Claoxylon remyi is threatened by deforestation and overharvesting."
