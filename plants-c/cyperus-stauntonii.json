    "intro": "Cyperus stauntonii, commonly known as the spike grass or narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and shallow water areas, and has narrow, linear leaves. Cyperus stauntonii produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense spikelets, which are often clustered at the ends of its stems. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
