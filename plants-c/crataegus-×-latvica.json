    "intro": "Crataegus \u00d7 latvica, commonly known as the hybrid hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree that belongs to the Rosaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Crataegus monogyna (common hawthorn) and Crataegus laevigata (smooth hawthorn), resulting in a plant with distinctive botanical features. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges, and the plant produces small, white or pink flowers in spring. It bears red or orange berries in the fall, which are edible but often used for ornamental purposes. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
