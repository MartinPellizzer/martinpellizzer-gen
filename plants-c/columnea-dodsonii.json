It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular red flowers that resemble flames, which are particularly attractive to hummingbirds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its native habitat. Its leaves are usually dark green and glossy, with a slightly waxy texture. Columnea dodsonii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to flourish."
