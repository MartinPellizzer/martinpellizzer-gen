    "intro": "Cymopterus foeniculaceus, commonly known as the western cowparsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and umbel-shaped flower clusters. It is native to western North America, particularly found in moist meadows and along streambanks. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with a stout, hollow stem that is often ribbed. Its flowers are small and white or greenish, arranged in compound umbels, and it produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps. The plant is often mistaken for poison hemlock due to its similar appearance, though it is non-toxic and can be used in traditional herbal practices."
