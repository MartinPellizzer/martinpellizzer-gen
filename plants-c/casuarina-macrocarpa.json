    "intro": "Casuarina macrocarpa, commonly known as the coastal she-oak, is a hardy evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like foliage and its ability to thrive in coastal and saline environments. The plant has small, woody cones that contain edible seeds, which are an important food source for native wildlife. Its root system helps stabilize sandy soils, making it valuable for coastal erosion control. Casuarina macrocarpa is also used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience to harsh conditions."
