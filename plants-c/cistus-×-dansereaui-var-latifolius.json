    "intro": "Cistus \u00d7 dansereaui var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf rockrose, is a hybrid shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features dense, evergreen foliage with leathery, oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rocky or arid landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
