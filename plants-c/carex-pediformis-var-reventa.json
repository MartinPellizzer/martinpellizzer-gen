It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and slightly folded along the midrib. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike that bears small, three-lobed flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
