    "intro": "Campanula persicifolia subvar. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf Persian bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Caucasus region. It features compact rosettes of dark green, slightly hairy leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped blue to violet flowers. The plant typically reaches a height of only a few inches, making it ideal for rock gardens or alpine settings. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sun, thriving in cooler climates. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate appearance and ability to bloom reliably in suitable conditions."
