It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in rocky or forested habitats at high altitudes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, while its bark is rough and fissured. Corylus potaninii is valued for its ornamental potential and is also studied for its ecological role in its native environment."
