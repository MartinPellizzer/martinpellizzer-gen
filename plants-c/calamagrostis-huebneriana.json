    "intro": "Calamagrostis huebneriana, commonly known as the European silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its distinctive silver-gray foliage that adds ornamental value to gardens. The plant produces feathery plumes in late summer, which are both visually appealing and beneficial for pollinators. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Calamagrostis huebneriana is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its low maintenance requirements in landscaping."
