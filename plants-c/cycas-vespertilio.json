    "intro": "Cycas vespertilio, commonly known as the evening cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, which is a rare characteristic among cycads. The plant features a stout, unbranched trunk with a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves that are often dark green and leathery. Its cones, or strobili, are typically borne on separate plants, with male cones producing pollen and female cones developing into seeds. Cycas vespertilio is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
