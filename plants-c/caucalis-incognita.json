    "intro": "Caucalis incognita, commonly known as the unknown caucalis, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered umbels of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a delicate, fern-like appearance. Caucalis incognita is relatively uncommon and has limited geographic distribution, making it a rare and interesting subject for botanical study."
