It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. This plant thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish itself in suitable habitats. The plant's structure and growth habits make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
