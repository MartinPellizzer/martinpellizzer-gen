It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that are typically green or brown in color. The plant thrives in moist to aquatic conditions, making it a common sight in swampy areas and along the edges of ponds. Its root system helps stabilize soil, contributing to wetland ecosystem health. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to filter water."
