    "intro": "Cerastium decalvans f. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth rock chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, white flowers. The foliage is typically covered in fine, soft hairs, though the 'glabrum' form is distinguished by its nearly hairless stems and leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions across Europe. This plant is notable for its resilience to harsh environmental conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats."
