It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and pastures. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a weed in many regions."
