It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, strap-like leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and green, often clustered in a raceme. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
