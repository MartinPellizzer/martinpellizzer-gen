    "intro": "Cytisus cantabricus, commonly known as the Cantabrian broom, is a flowering shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds with a tuft of silky hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Cytisus cantabricus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
