    "intro": "Corytholoma tribracteatum, commonly known as the three-bract coral tree, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive coral-like inflorescences, which consist of numerous small, brightly colored flowers clustered together. The plant produces three bracts at the base of its flower clusters, which are often mistaken for leaves. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture with a slightly serrated margin. Corytholoma tribracteatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant floral display."
