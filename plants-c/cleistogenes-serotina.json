    "intro": "Cleistogenes serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and compact, bluish-green foliage. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that typically open late in the growing season, hence its common name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in prairie and woodland habitats. Cleistogenes serotina is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
