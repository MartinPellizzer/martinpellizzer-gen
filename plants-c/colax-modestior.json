    "intro": "Colax modestior, commonly known as the modest dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky outcrops. The plant features a compact, rhizomatous root system and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a subtle fragrance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it blooms during the late spring to early summer season. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
