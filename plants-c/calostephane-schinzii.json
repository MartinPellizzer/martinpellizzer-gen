    "intro": "Calostephane schinzii, commonly known as the Schinz's calostephane, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae, which includes bellflowers, and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves, and it produces small, pale blue or white blossoms during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calostephane schinzii is considered an endangered species."
