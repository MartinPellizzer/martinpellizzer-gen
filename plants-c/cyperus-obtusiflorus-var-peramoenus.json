    "intro": "Cyperus obtusiflorus var. peramoenus, commonly known as the broadflower flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets with pale to brownish flowers, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily in moist soils, making it a common species in wetland ecosystems."
