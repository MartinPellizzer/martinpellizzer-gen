    "intro": "Campanula linoides, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or dry soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Campanula linoides is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
