    "intro": "Cerastium alpinum subsp. suffruticosum, commonly known as alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has hairy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh mountain environments. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in meadows, scree slopes, and alpine tundra. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
