    "intro": "Cephalophyllum rhodanthum, commonly known as the red-flowered candelabra cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, branching stems that resemble a candelabra, often covered in spines. The plant produces vibrant red flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscape designs."
