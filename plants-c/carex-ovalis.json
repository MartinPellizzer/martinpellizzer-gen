    "intro": "Carex ovalis, commonly known as the oval sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often in marshy areas or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it produces distinctive, three-sided seed capsules. Carex ovalis is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
