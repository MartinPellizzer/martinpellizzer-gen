    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe cundinamarcae, commonly known as the Cundinamarca fern, is a rare and unique species native to the Andean region of Colombia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in cloud forests at high elevations. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its leaves. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
