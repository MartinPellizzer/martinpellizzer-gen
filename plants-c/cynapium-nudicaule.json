    "intro": "Cynapium nudicaule, commonly known as the slender cowparsley, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and woodland edges. Cynapium nudicaule is generally non-invasive and is considered a minor weed in some agricultural settings."
