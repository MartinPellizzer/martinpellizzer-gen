    "intro": "Corydalis flexuosa subsp. gemmipara, commonly known as the creeping larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. The species is adapted to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
