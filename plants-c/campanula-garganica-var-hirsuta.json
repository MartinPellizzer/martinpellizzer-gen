    "intro": "Campanula garganica var. hirsuta, commonly known as the Hirsute Bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
