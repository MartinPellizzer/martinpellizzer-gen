It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are clustered in terminal racemes and are pollinated primarily by bees. The subspecies is distinguished by its larger flower size compared to other members of the species."
