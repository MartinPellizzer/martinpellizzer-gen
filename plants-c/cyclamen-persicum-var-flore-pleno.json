It features lush, velvety foliage with heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with silver markings. The flowers are typically pink or white, with a rich, velvety texture and a more compact form compared to standard cyclamens. This variety thrives in cool, bright environments with well-draining soil. It is prized for its ornamental value in both indoor and outdoor settings during the winter months."
