    "intro": "Cecropia montana, commonly known as the mountain cecropia, is a member of the Malvaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a fast-growing tree characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a unique symbiotic relationship with ants, which inhabit the hollow stems and provide protection against herbivores. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed habitats make it an important pioneer species in tropical forests. The bark and leaves of Cecropia montana have been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
