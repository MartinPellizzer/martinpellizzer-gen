    "intro": "Castilleja rubicundula var. rubicundula, commonly known as the redstem Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red, brush-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures, relying on host plants for water and nutrients. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its striking appearance makes it a popular subject in botanical gardens and natural areas."
