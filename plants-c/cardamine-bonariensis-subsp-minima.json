    "intro": "Cardamine bonariensis subsp. minima, commonly known as the miniature watercress, is a small, herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and arranged in a loose cluster. The subspecies is distinguished by its compact size and reduced leaf structure compared to the typical form of Cardamine bonariensis."
