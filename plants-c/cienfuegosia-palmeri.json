    "intro": "Cienfuegosia palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's cienfuegosia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cienfuegosia palmeri is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
