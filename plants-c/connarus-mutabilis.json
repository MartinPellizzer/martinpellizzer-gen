    "intro": "Connarus mutabilis, commonly known as the variable connarus, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, woody fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and understudied species in botanical research."
