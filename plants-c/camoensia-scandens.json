    "intro": "Camoensia scandens, commonly known as the climbing camoensia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Campanulaceae. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems that allow it to climb and spread across surfaces. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine, silvery down. Camoensia scandens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
