    "intro": "Chondrilla lejosperma, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its deep root system allows it to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments, making it well adapted to desert conditions. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
