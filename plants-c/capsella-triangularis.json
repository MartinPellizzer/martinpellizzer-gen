    "intro": "Capsella triangularis, commonly known as the triangular knotweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its triangular-shaped leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in various habitats."
