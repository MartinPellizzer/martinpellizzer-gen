    "intro": "Callista kentrochila, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock daisy, is a perennial herb native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Callista kentrochila is adapted to low-nutrient conditions and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands."
