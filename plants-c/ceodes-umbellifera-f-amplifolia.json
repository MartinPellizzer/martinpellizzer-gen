    "intro": "Ceodes umbellifera f. amplifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf ceodes, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often pubescent on the underside, giving it a unique texture. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in an umbel, which is a hallmark of its botanical classification. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
