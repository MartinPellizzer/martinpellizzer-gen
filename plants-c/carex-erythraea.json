    "intro": "Carex erythraea, commonly known as the red sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
