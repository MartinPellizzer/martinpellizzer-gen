It is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense, branched clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields, roadsides, and wastelands. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a common weed in many regions."
