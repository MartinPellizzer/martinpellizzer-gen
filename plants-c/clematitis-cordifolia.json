    "intro": "Clematitis cordifolia, commonly known as heartleaf clematis, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which give it its scientific name, and its clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as a vine or shrub, often climbing or sprawling along supports. Its flowers, which are usually blue or purple, bloom in the summer months and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Clematitis cordifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions."
