    "intro": "Cyperorchis, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. These plants are typically found in wetland habitats, where they thrive in moist, often acidic soils. Cyperorchis species are characterized by their grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The genus includes several species, such as Cyperorchis bulbosus and Cyperorchis ciliatus, which are native to various regions in North America. Their unique morphology and ecological preferences make them important components of wetland ecosystems."
