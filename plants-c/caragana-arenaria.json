    "intro": "Caragana arenaria, commonly known as the sand verbena or sand pea shrub, is a low-growing, deciduous shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It has slender, branching stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically yellow or pale green, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often appearing as small, needle-like structures to minimize surface area and water evaporation. Caragana arenaria is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in conditions of extreme drought and high temperatures."
