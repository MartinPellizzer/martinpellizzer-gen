    "intro": "Carex festiva var. decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, three-lobed spikelets that bloom in early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
