    "intro": "Cryptanthus reptans, commonly known as the snake's head plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Aizoaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its distinctive, fleshy, blue-green leaves. It produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom during the cooler months. Cryptanthus reptans is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
