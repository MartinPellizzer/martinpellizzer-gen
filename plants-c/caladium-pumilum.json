    "intro": "Caladium pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf arrowleaf caladium, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, brightly colored leaves that come in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant typically grows to a height of only 10\u201315 inches, making it a compact and ornamental choice for gardens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Caladium pumilum is often cultivated for its striking foliage rather than its flowers, which are small and inconspicuous."
