    "intro": "Condylocarpon brasiliense, commonly known as the Brazilian lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Roccellaceae. It is characterized by its crustose thallus, which adheres tightly to the substratum, typically found on tree bark in humid tropical regions. The organism is a symbiotic composite of a fungus and a green alga, with the algal component playing a crucial role in photosynthesis. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollutants. Its morphological features and ecological niche make it an important subject in studies of lichenology and environmental monitoring."
