    "intro": "Carex jamesii var. ultriformis, commonly known as the ultriform sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like foliage. This variety is distinguished by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. It often grows in open meadows, along stream banks, and in rocky areas. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges."
