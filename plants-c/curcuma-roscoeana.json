    "intro": "Curcuma roscoeana, commonly known as the Roscoe\u2019s turmeric, is a rhizomatous perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and is characterized by its ornamental leaves and fragrant flowers. The plant produces yellow-orange rhizomes that are similar in appearance to turmeric but are primarily cultivated for their aesthetic value rather than medicinal use. Its flowers are typically red or purple, and it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Curcuma roscoeana is often grown as a decorative plant in gardens and landscapes due to its striking foliage and unique floral display."
