It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 12,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers clustered in umbels. Its fruits are follicles that contain one or two seeds, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Cunonia indica thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks."
