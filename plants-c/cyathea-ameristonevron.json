    "intro": "Cyathea ameristonevron, commonly known as the American tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome system allows it to store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in tropical climates. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, a unique trait that helps attract pollinators and protect the plant from herbivores."
