    "intro": "Cyperus pinnatus, commonly known as the umbrella plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense, umbrella-like shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or near water bodies. Cyperus pinnatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in phytoremediation to clean contaminated soils."
