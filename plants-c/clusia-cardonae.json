    "intro": "Clusia cardonae, commonly known as the desert glorybower, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in poor soils. Clusia cardonae is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
