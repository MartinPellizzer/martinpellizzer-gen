    "intro": "Commelina virginica var. villosa, commonly known as hairy yellow arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy textures, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers with three petals and three sepals, typical of the Commelina genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
