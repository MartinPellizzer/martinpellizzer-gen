    "intro": "Cyclanthera explodens var. trifida, commonly known as the exploding cucumber, is a unique vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rapid growth and distinctive, swollen, green fruit that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The fruit's outer skin is thin and papery, and when mature, it bursts open with a loud noise, dispersing its seeds. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for its unique seed dispersal mechanism."
