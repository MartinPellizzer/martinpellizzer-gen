    "intro": "Cheilanthes intertexta, commonly known as the desert shield fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions. The plant has dark green, leathery fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy scales. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered near the margins. Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is often used in xeriscaping and rock gardens."
