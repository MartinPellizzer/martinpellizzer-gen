    "intro": "Cupaniopsis fleckeri, commonly known as the Flinders Island hakea, is a flowering plant native to the island of Flinders in the Bass Strait, Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, white or cream-colored flowers that are typically clustered in spikes. It is adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat and exhibits drought tolerance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
