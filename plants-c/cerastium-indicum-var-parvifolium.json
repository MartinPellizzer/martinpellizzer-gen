It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, ovate leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its botanical structure is adapted for efficient nutrient absorption in poor soils."
