It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that resemble the shape of a pear, giving it its common name. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk that is covered in a fibrous, spongy layer. Its reproductive structures include a large, cone-like structure that produces both male and female spores. Cyphia persicifolia is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
