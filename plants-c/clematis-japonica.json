    "intro": "Clematis japonica, commonly known as Japanese clematis, is a deciduous vine native to East Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five oval-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Its climbing habit requires a support structure, and it is often used in ornamental landscaping. Clematis japonica is also valued for its showy blooms that appear in late spring to early summer."
