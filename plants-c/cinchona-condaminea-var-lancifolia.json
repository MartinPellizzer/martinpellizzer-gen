    "intro": "Cinchona condaminea var. lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved quina, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces red or orange berries that contain the alkaloid quinine, historically used in malaria treatment. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes. Its botanical significance lies in its role in traditional medicine and its genetic contribution to cultivated cinchona species."
