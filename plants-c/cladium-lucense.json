It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Cladium lucense plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its adaptability to waterlogged conditions makes it a common species in marshes and along the edges of ponds and lakes."
