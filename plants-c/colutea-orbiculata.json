    "intro": "Colutea orbiculata, commonly known as the round-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in spikes. The plant has no true roots and instead attaches to its host through haustoria, specialized structures that penetrate the host's tissues. It is typically found in grasslands and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its habitat."
