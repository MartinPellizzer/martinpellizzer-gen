    "intro": "Cardamine insignis, commonly known as the noble watercress, is a delicate herbaceous plant native to the moist, shaded environments of temperate regions. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other cruciferous plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant features small, rounded leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, and its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. It thrives in cool, damp conditions and is often found near streams or in shaded forest floors. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
