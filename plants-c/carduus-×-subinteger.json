    "intro": "Carduus \u00d7 subinteger, commonly known as the broadleaf thistle. It is a hybrid plant in the Asteraceae family, characterized by its large, spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flower heads. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are usually broad and lobed, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. The flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
