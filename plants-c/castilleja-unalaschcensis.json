    "intro": "Castilleja unalaschcensis, commonly known as the Unalaska milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the coastal regions of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, often in association with other coastal flora. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with certain fungi, which help it obtain nutrients from host plants. Castilleja unalaschcensis is an important component of the local ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
