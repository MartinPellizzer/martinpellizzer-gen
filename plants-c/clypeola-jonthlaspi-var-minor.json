    "intro": "Clypeola jonthlaspi var. minor, commonly known as the lesser clypeola, is a rare and diminutive flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in the spring, and the plant produces small, spherical fruits that disperse its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
