    "intro": "Cymbalaria glutinosa subsp. brevicalcarata, commonly known as the sticky weed or sticky spring-beauty, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its hairy stems and small, showy flowers that range from white to pink in color. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in waste areas. Its sticky leaves and flowers make it easily identifiable and somewhat unique among the species of the genus Cymbalaria."
