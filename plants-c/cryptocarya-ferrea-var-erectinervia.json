    "intro": "Cryptocarya ferrea var. erectinervia, commonly known as the Brazilian ironwood, is a member of the Lauraceae family and is native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its dark, dense wood and glossy, elliptical leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by dark purple berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its hardiness and ornamental qualities. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
