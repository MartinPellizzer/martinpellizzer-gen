    "intro": "Clematis viticella var. campaniflora, commonly known as the campanula-flowered Clematis, is a compact, deciduous vine native to Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale blue flowers in early summer. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is relatively hardy and suitable for growing in a variety of soil types, making it a popular choice for gardeners. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its fragrant, long-lasting blooms."
