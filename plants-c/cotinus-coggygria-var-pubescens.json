    "intro": "Cotinus coggygria var. pubescens, commonly known as the velvet tree or smoke bush, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, feathery inflorescences that produce a smoky, pinkish-purple haze in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical, with a glossy, dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. The plant is also valued for its autumn color, with leaves turning vibrant shades of red and purple."
