    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis var. simulans, commonly known as the brittle fern or the delicate maidenhair fern, is a variety of the brittle bladder fern. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green with a bluish tint. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens."
