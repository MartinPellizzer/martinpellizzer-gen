It belongs to the family Aristolochiaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular, purple flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves and can grow as a vine or shrub, often reaching lengths of up to 10 feet. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. The flowers bloom in late summer and early fall, producing a fragrant, nectar-rich display."
