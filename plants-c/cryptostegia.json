    "intro": "Cryptostegia, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plants are characterized by their woody stems, alternate leaves, and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The fruits are legumes that split open to release seeds, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine. Cryptostegia species are also valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
