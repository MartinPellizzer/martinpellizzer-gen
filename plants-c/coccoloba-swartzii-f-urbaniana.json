    "intro": "Coccoloba swartzii f. urbaniana, commonly known as the Florida hibiscus, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a shrub characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom in late summer. Its botanical features make it a unique subject for study in botany and horticulture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
