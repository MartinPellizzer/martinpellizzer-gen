    "intro": "Chamaesyce duckei, commonly known as the coastal knotweed, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing, mat-forming herb that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along shorelines and dunes. The plant has small, opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny, greenish-white flowers in clusters. It is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure, making it a hardy species in coastal ecosystems. Chamaesyce duckei plays a role in stabilizing dune soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
