    "intro": "Cirsium parryi subsp. mogollonicum, commonly known as the Mogollon thistle, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, gray-green foliage and large, showy purple to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as cliffs, canyons, and slopes. It has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in arid conditions.
