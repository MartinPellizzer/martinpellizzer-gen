    "intro": "Cytisus spinescens var. pollinensis, commonly known as the Scottish broom, is a shrub native to the Scottish Highlands. It is characterized by its yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, spiny stems and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as heathlands and grassy slopes. This variety is closely related to other members of the genus Cytisus, which are known for their ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
