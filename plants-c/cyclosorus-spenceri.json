    "intro": "Cyclosorus spenceri, commonly known as the Spencer's cyclosorus, is a rare and delicate fern native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that form a compact, low-growing rosette. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments with high humidity, making it a challenging species to cultivate outside its natural habitat. Its spores are dispersed through wind, and the plant reproduces primarily through spore propagation rather than seeds. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Cyclosorus spenceri is considered a species of conservation concern."
