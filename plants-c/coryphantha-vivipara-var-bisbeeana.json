    "intro": "Coryphantha vivipara var. bisbeeana, commonly known as the Bisbee cactus, is a rare and distinctive species native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that often branch near the base, forming a low, compact plant. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It is a viviparous species, meaning it gives birth to live young through its stems, which produce offsets. This variety is highly sought after by cactus enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and limited distribution."
