    "intro": "Cerastium glomeratum subsp. megacalyx, commonly known as the clustered mouse-ear or large-calyx mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features small, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette, and it produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its larger calyces compared to other members of the species, which are often hairy and persist after flowering. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
