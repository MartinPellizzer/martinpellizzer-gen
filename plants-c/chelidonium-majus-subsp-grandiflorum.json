    "intro": "Chelidonium majus subsp. grandiflorum, commonly known as the greater celandine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a sturdy, branched stem that can grow up to 1 meter tall, often with a reddish hue. The plant produces bright yellow, leaf-like flowers that are clustered in umbels, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are alternate, lobed, and covered in a waxy coating, while its roots contain alkaloids that have been used historically in traditional medicine. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows."
