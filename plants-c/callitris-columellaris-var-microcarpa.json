    "intro": "Callitris columellaris var. microcarpa, commonly known as the coastal leatherwood, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage composed of scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered around the stems. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. This species is valued for its hardiness and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
