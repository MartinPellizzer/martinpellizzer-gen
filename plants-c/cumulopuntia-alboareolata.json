    "intro": "Cumulopuntia alboareolata, commonly known as the white areolated cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems covered in white, waxy tubercles that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, red fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
