    "intro": "Catabrosa hierochloides, commonly known as the golden beard grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with golden hues. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
