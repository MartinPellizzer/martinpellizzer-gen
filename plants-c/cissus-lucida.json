    "intro": "Cissus lucida, commonly known as the shining cissus, is a trailing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, giving them a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its stems are succulent and can climb or trail along surfaces, making it suitable for hanging baskets or trellises. Cissus lucida is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright indirect light and moderate watering."
