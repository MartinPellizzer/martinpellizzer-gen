    "intro": "Cryphiantha imbricata, commonly known as the rock fig, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains several seeds, and it is adapted to survive in harsh environmental conditions."
