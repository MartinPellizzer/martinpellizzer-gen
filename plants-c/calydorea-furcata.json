    "intro": "Calydorea furcata, commonly known as the forked lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its distinct, branched thallus structure, which gives it its common name. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an alga or cyanobacterium, typical of lichens. It is typically found growing on bark, stone, or soil in temperate regions. Calydorea furcata is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
