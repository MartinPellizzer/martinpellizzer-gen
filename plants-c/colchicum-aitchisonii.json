    "intro": "Colchicum aitchisonii, commonly known as the Aitchison's colchicum, is a rare and striking member of the Colchicaceae family. Native to the mountainous regions of northern Pakistan, it thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. The plant produces striking violet or purple flowers in late summer, with reflexed petals and a distinctive spurred shape. Its bulbous corm is adapted for survival in harsh alpine climates, allowing it to endure periods of dormancy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
