    "intro": "Cyclosorus caroli, commonly known as the Carolinian water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Lamiales and is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters near the water's surface. Cyclosorus caroli plays a minor but important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through oxygen production."
