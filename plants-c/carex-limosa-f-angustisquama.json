It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. This subspecies is native to wetland habitats and thrives in moist, acidic soils, often found in marshes and bogs. Its growth habit is clump-forming, with rhizomes that help it spread and establish in suitable environments. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
