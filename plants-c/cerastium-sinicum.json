It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its flowering period occurs in early spring, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds.
