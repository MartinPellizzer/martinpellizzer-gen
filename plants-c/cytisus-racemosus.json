It is characterized by its bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, leathery leaves that are opposite in arrangement. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in open woodlands or along coastal areas. The plant is also known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil restoration efforts."
