    "intro": "Calandrinia bracteosa, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Portulacaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments, with a shallow root system that allows it to absorb moisture efficiently. Its flowers are typically pink or red, and they open in response to sunlight, closing at dusk. Calandrinia bracteosa is also known for its ability to reseed itself, making it a common weed in disturbed soils."
