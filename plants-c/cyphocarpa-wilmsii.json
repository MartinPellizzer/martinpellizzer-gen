    "intro": "Cyphocarpa wilmsii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems, narrow lance-shaped leaves, and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to dry conditions, with thick, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically borne in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cyphocarpa wilmsii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
