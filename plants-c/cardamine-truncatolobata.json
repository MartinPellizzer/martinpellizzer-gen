    "intro": "Cardamine truncatolobata, commonly known as the narrow-lobed watercress, is a perennial herb native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It has delicate, trifoliate leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length, with a slightly heart-shaped base. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in rich, loamy soils near streams or in woodland areas. The species is often found in wetlands and is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
