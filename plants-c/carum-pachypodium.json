    "intro": "Carum pachypodium, commonly known as the Madagascar star, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the dry season. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss. Carum pachypodium is part of the family Asteraceae and is often cultivated for its unique appearance and resilience."
