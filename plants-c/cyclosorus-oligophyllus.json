    "intro": "Cyclosorus oligophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Oleandraceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces with its rhizomes. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered along the margins of the fronds. Cyclosorus oligophyllus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
