    "intro": "Colchicum autumnale var. provinciale, commonly known as the meadow colchicum, is a perennial bulbous plant native to Europe. It produces striking violet to purple flowers in late summer and autumn, typically from August to October. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is characterized by its toxic properties, containing colchicine, a potent alkaloid. It thrives in woodland and meadow habitats, often in shaded or semi-shaded areas. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in gardens."
