    "intro": "Chionanthus filiformis, commonly known as the threadleaf chionanthus, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves that are opposite and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in panicles and have a subtle, sweet scent. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
