    "intro": "Carlina acanthifolia nothosubsp. lecoqii, commonly known as the Lecq's thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, rough, woolly leaves that are often covered in stiff hairs. The plant produces showy, violet-blue capitula composed of numerous ray florets, which are typically surrounded by a dense layer of bracts. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats at high altitudes. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
