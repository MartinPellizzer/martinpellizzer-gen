    "intro": "Clinacanthus robinsoni, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with a unique structure that resembles a ghostly face, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions for successful cultivation. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
