    "intro": "Connarus conchocarpus subsp. conchocarpus, commonly known as the horned banyan, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, buttressed roots and a dense canopy of broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers followed by distinctive, woody fruits that resemble horns, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. The species is valued for its ecological role and has limited economic use due to its hard, heavy wood."
