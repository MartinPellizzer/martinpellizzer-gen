    "intro": "Crataegus arrogans, commonly known as the Canadian hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters, featuring thorny branches and oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, which are followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its fruit is an important food source for birds and small mammals, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and hardiness."
