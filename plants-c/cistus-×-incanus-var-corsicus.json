    "intro": "Cistus \u00d7 incanus var. corsicus, commonly known as Corsican rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia. It features aromatic, glandular leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to lavender flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for Mediterranean climates. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves and flowers, are used in perfumery and traditional medicine."
