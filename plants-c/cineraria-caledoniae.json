    "intro": "Cineraria caledoniae, commonly known as the Caledonian cineraria, is a flowering plant native to the island of Jersey in the Channel Islands. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal habitats and is adapted to the maritime climate of its native region. It produces showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
