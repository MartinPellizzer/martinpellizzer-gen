    "intro": "Crepidium auratum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Crepidium auratum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
