It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow leaves, typically growing in wetland or aquatic environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered at the tips of the stems. It is an herbaceous perennial that thrives in shallow water or moist soils, making it a common sight in marshy areas. Due to its adaptability, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
