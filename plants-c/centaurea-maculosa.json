    "intro": "Centaurea maculosa, commonly known as spotted knapweed, is an invasive flowering plant native to Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers with red-brown markings and serrated, gray-green leaves. The plant grows up to 1.5 meters tall and produces a large number of seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation in grasslands and roadside areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
