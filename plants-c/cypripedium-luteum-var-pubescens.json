    "intro": "Cypripedium luteum var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy yellow lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow pouch-shaped lip, which is covered in a fine, hairy texture, giving it its varietal name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its flowers are relatively small compared to other lady's slipper species, with a delicate, fragrant appearance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
