    "intro": "Campanula hygrophila, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist soils, often in marshes, stream banks, and damp woodlands. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a hairy texture. Campanula hygrophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in wet conditions, making it a useful plant for ecological restoration projects."
