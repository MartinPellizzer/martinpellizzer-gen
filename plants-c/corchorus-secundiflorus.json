    "intro": "Corchorus secundiflorus, commonly known as the slender-flowered spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Corchorus secundiflorus is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
