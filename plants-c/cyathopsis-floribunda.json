    "intro": "Cyathopsis floribunda, commonly known as the clustered cupflower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters within a cup-like involucrum. Cyathopsis floribunda is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
