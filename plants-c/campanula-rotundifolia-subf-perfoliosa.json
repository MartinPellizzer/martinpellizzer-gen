    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia subf. perfoliosa, commonly known as the round-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of rounded, velvety leaves and stems that bear bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to violet. The flowers typically bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This subspecies is often found in moist, shaded environments like woodlands and stream sides. Its botanical features make it a valued plant in both natural habitats and horticultural gardens."
