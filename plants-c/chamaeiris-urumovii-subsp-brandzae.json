    "intro": "Chamaeiris urumovii subsp. brandzae, commonly known as the Brandzae's chamaeiris, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Caucasus region. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
