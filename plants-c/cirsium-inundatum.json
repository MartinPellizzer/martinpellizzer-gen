    "intro": "Cirsium inundatum, commonly known as the water thistle, is a perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cirsium inundatum thrives in moist soils and is often found near rivers, marshes, and other waterlogged areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
