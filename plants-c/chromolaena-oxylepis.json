    "intro": "Chromolaena oxylepis, commonly known as crofton weed, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its rapid growth rate makes it an invasive species in many regions. Chromolaena oxylepis is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to drought conditions."
