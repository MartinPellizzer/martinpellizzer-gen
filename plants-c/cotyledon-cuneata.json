    "intro": "Cotyledon cuneata, commonly known as the diamond-shaped cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The leaves are typically green with distinctive white or yellow markings, which help in photosynthesis and attract pollinators. It produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding to its ornamental value. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
