    "intro": "Cotoneaster glaucophyllus var. glaucophyllus, commonly known as the silverleaf cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it can be invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
