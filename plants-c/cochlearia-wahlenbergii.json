    "intro": "Cochlearia wahlenbergii, commonly known as the Wahlenberg's cochlearia, is a flowering plant species native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with small, cross-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are often rosette-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from freezing temperatures. The flowers, which are usually white or pale purple, bloom in early summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
