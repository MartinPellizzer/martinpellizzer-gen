    "intro": "Cyperus rosattii, commonly known as the Rosattii flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along waterways, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its slender, grass-like stems are often mistaken for true grasses, but it has distinct triangular stems and small, clustered flowering structures. Cyperus rosattii is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive appearance and adaptability to various aquatic environments."
