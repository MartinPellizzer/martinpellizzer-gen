    "intro": "Croton wassi-kussae, commonly known as the Ethiopian croton, is a shrub native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to withstand drought and grows in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
