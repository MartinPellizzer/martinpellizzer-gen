    "intro": "Convallaria majalis f. latifrons, commonly known as the broad-leaved lily of the valley, is a variant of the traditional lily of the valley species. It is characterized by its broader, more elongated leaves compared to the typical form, which gives it a distinct appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. It is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in woodland areas. Its botanical features make it a sought-after ornamental plant in gardens and botanical collections."
