    "intro": "Crocus lageniflorus subvar. trilineatus, commonly known as the three-lined crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features striking, trumpet-shaped flowers with a distinctive three-lobed petal structure, which gives it its common name. The flowers typically bloom in early spring, showcasing a range of colors from yellow to orange and red. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous corm, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in gardens with proper drainage."
