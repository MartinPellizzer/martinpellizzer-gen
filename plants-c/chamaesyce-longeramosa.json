    "intro": "Chamaesyce longeramosa, commonly known as the longstem sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Chamaesyce longeramosa is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert habitats."
