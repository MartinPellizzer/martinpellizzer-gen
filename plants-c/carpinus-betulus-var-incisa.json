It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically 5-10 cm long and have a serrated margin. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for urban landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
