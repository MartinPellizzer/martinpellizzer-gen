    "intro": "Cystopteris emarginata, commonly known as the marginal shield fern, is a species of fern native to various parts of the world, including North America, Europe, and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green and have a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its spores are released from small, kidney-shaped sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. Cystopteris emarginata plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
