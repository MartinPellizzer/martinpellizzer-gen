    "intro": "Castilleja martini var. martini, commonly known as the narrowleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vivid red or orange floral bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures called phyllodes, which are used for photosynthesis. It attaches to the roots of host plants, such as grasses and shrubs, to obtain water and nutrients. Castilleja martini var. martini thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in sagebrush-steppe ecosystems."
