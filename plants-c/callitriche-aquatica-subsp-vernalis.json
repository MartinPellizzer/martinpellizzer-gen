    "intro": "Callitriche aquatica subsp. vernalis, commonly known as spring water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often floating or partially submerged, with small, opposite, oval-shaped leaves. Its flowers are tiny, white or pale blue, and appear in clusters near the water surface. This subspecies is often found in moist habitats and is an indicator of clean, unpolluted water."
