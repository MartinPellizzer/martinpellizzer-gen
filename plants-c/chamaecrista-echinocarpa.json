    "intro": "Chamaecrista echinocarpa, commonly known as the hairy poinsettia or horse bean, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often surrounded by bracts that may resemble leaves. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, spiny pod, which contributes to its common name. Chamaecrista echinocarpa is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique seed pods."
