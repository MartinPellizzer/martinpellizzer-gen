It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, hairless stems and clusters of small, pinkish to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers bloom in early to mid-summer.
