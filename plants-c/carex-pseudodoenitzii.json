    "intro": "Carex pseudodoenitzii, commonly known as the Mexican sedge, is a perennial plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually brown or green, and it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens. Carex pseudodoenitzii is valued for its ability to thrive in wetland conditions and its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
