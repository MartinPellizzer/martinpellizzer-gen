    "intro": "Crataegus russata, commonly known as the American hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated edges and a glossy green upper surface. Crataegus russata is valued in landscaping for its ornamental flowers and berries, as well as its ecological benefits."
