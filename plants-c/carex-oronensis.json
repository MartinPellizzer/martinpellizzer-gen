    "intro": "Carex oronensis, commonly known as the Orontes sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant features grass-like leaves that are usually narrow and slightly hairy, with a dense rosette structure. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-stamen flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Carex oronensis is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
