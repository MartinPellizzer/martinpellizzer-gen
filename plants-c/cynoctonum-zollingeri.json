    "intro": "Cynoctonum zollingeri, commonly known as the Zollinger's cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Madagascar. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires minimal water once established. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
