It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery inflorescences that produce vibrant yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has compound leaves composed of numerous small, elliptical leaflets, giving it a finely textured appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for ornamental gardening in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its showy flowers and drought tolerance, it is often used in landscaping and as a cut flower."
