    "intro": "Cynometra longituba, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Caesalpiniaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and compound leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, brown seeds. It is often found in moist lowland forests and is valued for its hard, durable wood. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
