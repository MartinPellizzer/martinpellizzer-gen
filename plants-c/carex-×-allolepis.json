It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Carex stricta and Carex lyngbyei. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. It forms dense, grass-like clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves. The inflorescence consists of a spike of small, greenish flowers that are often inconspicuous."
