    "intro": "Conyza pusilla, commonly known as dwarf ironweed, is a small annual herb native to the Americas. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces fine, bristly hairs on its leaves and stems, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to thrive in temperate climates. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it is known for its rapid growth cycle."
