    "intro": "Cordia lucidula, commonly known as the shining cordia, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, glossy green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, round fruits that turn from green to red as they mature, containing several seeds. It is often found in humid, lowland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal. The wood of Cordia lucidula is lightweight and has been used in traditional crafts and construction in its native regions."
