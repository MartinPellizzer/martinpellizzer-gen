It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue or purple flowers. The plant produces a distinctive seed capsule that splits open to release its tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Conostylis psyllium is also known for its ecological importance, providing nectar for native pollinators."
