It features dense, rounded clusters of small, sky-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has gray-green, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, bushy form. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its foliage and floral display make it a popular choice for xeriscaping in desert landscapes."
