    "intro": "Chondrosum rothrockii, commonly known as the Rothrock's rockcress, is a rare flowering plant native to the Appalachian Mountains. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pungent odor. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. It has hairy, lobed leaves and produces seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
