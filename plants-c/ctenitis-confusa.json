    "intro": "Ctenitis confusa, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, undulating fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce clusters of small, oval-shaped leaves. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a unique zigzag pattern along the midribs. Ctenitis confusa is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices."
