    "intro": "Campyloneurum levigatum, commonly known as the smooth-leafed fern, is a member of the Hymenophyllaceae family. It is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and finely veined, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus on the underside of its fronds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments such as greenhouses."
