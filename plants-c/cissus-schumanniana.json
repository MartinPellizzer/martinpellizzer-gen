    "intro": "Cissus schumanniana, commonly known as the climbing fig or silver vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often tinged with silver or white veins, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are typically green when mature. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cissus schumanniana is often used as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
