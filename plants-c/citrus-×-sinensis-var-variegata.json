    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 sinensis var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated lemon, is a hybrid citrus plant characterized by its unique foliage and fruit. It exhibits variegated leaf patterns, often featuring white or yellow markings, which distinguish it from standard lemons. The plant is a small tree or shrub, typically growing to a height of 3\u20135 meters, with fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit is similar to the common lemon but may have a slightly different flavor and appearance due to its hybrid nature. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal."
