    "intro": "Corynopuntia, commonly known as the nightshade cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae. These plants are native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where they thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. They are characterized by their spiny stems and showy, often nocturnal flowers that attract specific pollinators. Corynopuntia species typically have a compact growth habit and are often used in rock gardens or as ornamental plants. Their botanical features make them well-adapted to harsh desert conditions."
