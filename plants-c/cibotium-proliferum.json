    "intro": "Cibotium proliferum, commonly known as the Hawaiian tree fern, is a member of the Dicksoniaceae family. It is a large, evergreen fern that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with a stout, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, dark brown rind. The plant features a crown of large, pinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. Its roots form a dense, fibrous network that helps stabilize the soil and retain moisture. Native to the Hawaiian Islands, it thrives in moist, shaded environments and is an important component of the region's native flora."
