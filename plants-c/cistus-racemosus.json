    "intro": "Cistus racemosus, commonly known as the racemose rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen foliage and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cistus racemosus is also valued for its essential oils, which are used in perfumery and traditional medicine."
