    "intro": "Campnosperma zacharyi, commonly known as the white wattle, is a small, deciduous tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and delicate, feathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in late winter to early spring, which are arranged in compact, spike-like clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods that split open when mature, releasing the seeds to the wind. The species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
