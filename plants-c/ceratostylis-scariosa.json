    "intro": "Ceratostylis scariosa, commonly known as the scarious spike orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a slender, wiry rhizome and produces a single, erect spike of small, pale green to white flowers. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique floral structure and specific habitat requirements make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
