    "intro": "Ceropteris tartarea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its spores are dispersed through the wind, contributing to its reproductive strategy. The fronds are composed of small, finger-like segments called pinnae, which aid in photosynthesis and water retention."
