    "intro": "Cartiera howellii, commonly known as Howell's cartiera, is a rare and little-known flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in humid forests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a cluster. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
