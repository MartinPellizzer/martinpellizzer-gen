    "intro": "Cerastium mutabile, commonly known as the variable mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Cerastium mutabile is also known for its ability to hybridize easily, leading to considerable variation in its appearance."
