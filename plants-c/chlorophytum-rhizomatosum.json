    "intro": "Chlorophytum rhizomatosum, commonly known as the snake plant, is a hardy, evergreen perennial plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped leaves that are typically green with a distinctive yellow or white midrib. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers on slender stalks, though it is more prized for its foliage than its blooms. It is well adapted to low-light conditions and requires minimal water, making it an excellent choice for indoor gardening. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense clumps over time."
