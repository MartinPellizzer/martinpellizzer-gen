    "intro": "Cyrtomium, commonly known as the holly fern, is a genus of evergreen ferns belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, leathery fronds that often have a spiny or serrated appearance. Cyrtomium species are native to various regions in Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea, where they thrive in shaded, moist environments. They typically grow in dense clusters, forming compact, shrub-like structures. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the genus is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
