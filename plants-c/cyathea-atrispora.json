    "intro": "Cyathea atrispora, commonly known as the black-spored tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive dark, leathery appearance, with its spores being black in color, which gives it its common name. Cyathea atrispora typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often near rivers or in dense forests. Its slow growth rate and unique morphology make it a valuable specimen in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
