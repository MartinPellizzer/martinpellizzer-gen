It is characterized by its soft, fleshy stems and large, broad leaves, which distinguish it from typical cacti that have spines and reduced leaves. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
