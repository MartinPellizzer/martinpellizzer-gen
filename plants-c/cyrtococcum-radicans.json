    "intro": "Cyrtococcum radicans, commonly known as the creeping broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It attaches itself to the roots of host plants, primarily those in the Brassicaceae family, to absorb nutrients. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often overlooked due to its inconspicuous appearance. It is found in various regions across Europe and parts of Asia, typically in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecosystems by influencing the growth and distribution of its host species."
