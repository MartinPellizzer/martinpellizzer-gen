    "intro": "Cuscuta odorata, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of thin, thread-like stems. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to infest a variety of host species, including crops and ornamental plants. It spreads through seeds and can cause significant damage to agricultural systems. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, where it attaches using specialized haustoria to extract water and nutrients."
