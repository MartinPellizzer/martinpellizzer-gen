It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often variegated with yellow and green patterns. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its succulent-like leaves help it store water, making it drought-tolerant. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and ability to thrive in warm, sunny environments."
