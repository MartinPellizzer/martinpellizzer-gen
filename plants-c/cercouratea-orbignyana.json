    "intro": "Cercouratea orbignyana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued in musical instrument making. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
