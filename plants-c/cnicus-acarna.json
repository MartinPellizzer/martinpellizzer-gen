    "intro": "Cnicus acarna, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Cnicus acarna is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
