    "intro": "Cephalanthera angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved\u6753\u5170, is a rare and elegant orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and a single, strikingly colored flower that typically ranges from greenish-yellow to reddish-brown. The plant is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. It produces a unique structure called a resupinate flower, where the petals and sepals are twisted around the column. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
