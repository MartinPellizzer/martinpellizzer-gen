    "intro": "Caralluma intermedia, commonly known as the Indian figleaf cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of India and Pakistan. It features a branching structure with flattened, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Caralluma intermedia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
