It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, with four to five petals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cherleria baldaccii is considered a species of conservation concern."
