    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna var. rubra-plena, commonly known as the red-flowered hawthorn, is a cultivar of the hawthorn plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its dense, rounded form and its profusion of double, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are oval with serrated edges, and the plant produces small, red berries in the fall. It is often used in hedgerows and as an ornamental plant due to its showy flowers and hardy nature. This variety is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing food for birds and supporting pollinators."
