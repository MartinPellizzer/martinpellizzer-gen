    "intro": "Cotinus coggygria var. pendulus, commonly known as the weeping smoke tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, cascading branches that create a weeping effect, enhancing its ornamental appeal. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are followed by pinkish-red, fluffy seed heads that persist into autumn. Its leaves turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall, adding to its seasonal beauty. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
