    "intro": "Cecropia adenopus var. oblonga, commonly known as the broadleaf ceiba, is a fast-growing, evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, spherical fruits containing numerous seeds. It has a unique symbiotic relationship with ants, which protect the tree from herbivores in exchange for shelter and food. This species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitats."
