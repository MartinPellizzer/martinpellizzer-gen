It is native to the tropical regions of Australia, particularly Queensland, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. This species is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that come in a range of colors, including pink, red, and orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its unique floral structure and adaptability make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts and botanists alike."
