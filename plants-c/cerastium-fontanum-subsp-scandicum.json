    "intro": "Cerastium fontanum subsp. scandicum, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, hairy leaves arranged in a rosette and produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers throughout the growing season. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its stems are prostrate and often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
