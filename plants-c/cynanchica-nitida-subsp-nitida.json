It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender stems that are often hairy and slightly woody at the base. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually lance-shaped and covered with fine pubescence. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense panicles, and are typically pale blue to purple in color. The species is adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
