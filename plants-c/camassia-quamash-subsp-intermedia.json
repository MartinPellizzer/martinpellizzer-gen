    "intro": "Camassia quamash subsp. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate camas, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its blue to violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces bulbous roots that are adapted to survive in cooler climates. This subspecies is often confused with other camas species but can be distinguished by its floral color and growth patterns."
