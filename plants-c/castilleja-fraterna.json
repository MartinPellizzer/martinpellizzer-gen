    "intro": "Castilleja fraterna, commonly known as the fraternale indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Castilleja fraterna plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
