    "intro": "Carum leucocoleon var. porphyrocoleon, commonly known as the purple-flowered chervil, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the carum genus. It is characterized by its distinctive purple or reddish flowers, which contrast with the typical green hues of other carum species. The plant is native to specific regions in Central Asia, where it thrives in rocky, arid environments. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a mild, aromatic scent, similar to other members of the Apiaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral characteristics, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists specializing in rare plant species."
