    "intro": "Carum verticillatum, commonly known as mountain savory, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Caucasus. It is a perennial herb with slender, upright stems and small, fragrant leaves that emit a strong, savory scent. The plant produces small white or pale blue flowers arranged in whorls along the stems, which is a distinctive botanical feature. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine and as a culinary spice."
