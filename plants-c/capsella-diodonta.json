It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its small, white flowers and heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release two tiny seeds. The species is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas."
