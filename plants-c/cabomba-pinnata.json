    "intro": "Cabomba pinnata, commonly known as the sacred lotus of Brazil, is a water plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, floating foliage and striking, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that create a lush, green canopy on the water surface. Its roots are often submerged, anchoring it in aquatic environments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. Cabomba pinnata is often cultivated in ponds and water gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
