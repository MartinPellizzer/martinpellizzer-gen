    "intro": "Coccoloba paniculata, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal areas, often in brackish or saltwater environments. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are usually red or reddish in color, which help it absorb more sunlight in shaded conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered in panicles, and it produces berries that are a food source for various wildlife. Coccoloba paniculata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial species."
