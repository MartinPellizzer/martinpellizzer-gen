    "intro": "Crotalaria mollis, commonly known as the slender crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows as an annual or biennial herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its seeds are enclosed in a pod-like fruit, and the plant is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability due to root nodules containing symbiotic bacteria. Crotalaria mollis is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
