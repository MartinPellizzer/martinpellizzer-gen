    "intro": "Centaurea macroptilon subsp. oxylepis, commonly known as the narrowleaf starthistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features spiny, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in dense, conical clusters. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in disturbed soils. Its botanical characteristics make it both ecologically significant and a potential weed in non-native environments."
