    "intro": "Coptidipteris, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a genus of vascular plants belonging to the order Lepidoziellales. These plants are characterized by their small, scale-like leaves and a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus. Coptidipteris species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. They play an important role in soil stabilization and provide habitat for various microorganisms. Despite their ancient lineage, some species of Coptidipteris are still cultivated for ornamental purposes."
