    "intro": "Campanula mentiens, commonly known as the \"speaking bellflower,\" is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically blue or violet in color, which bloom in late summer. The plant has heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Campanula mentiens is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
