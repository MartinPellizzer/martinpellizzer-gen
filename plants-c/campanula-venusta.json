It features upright, branching stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, and white. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and slightly hairy, providing a textured contrast to the delicate blooms. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The plant is noted for its long blooming period, typically from late spring to early autumn."
