    "intro": "Camaridium longicolumna, commonly known as the long-stemmed orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often adorned with lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, arranged in clustered inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
