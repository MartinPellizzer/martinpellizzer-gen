    "intro": "Chrysothamnus nauseosus var. uintahensis, commonly known as the Uintah bitterbrush, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellowish-green foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The Uintah bitterbrush plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
