    "intro": "Cranichis, commonly known as the grass piper, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with moist, shaded environments. They typically grow as small herbs or shrubs, with narrow, grass-like leaves and delicate, often fragrant flowers. The flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pink and purple. Cranichis species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as houseplants."
