    "intro": "Crataegus trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and its showy white or pink flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus trifoliata is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and floral display. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade."
