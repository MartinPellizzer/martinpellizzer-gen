    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris f. prionophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed version of the common chickweed, is a variant of the annual weed Capsella bursa-pastoris. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical form. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, which are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This form is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a cosmopolitan weed in various regions."
