    "intro": "Crocus heuffelianus f. niveus, commonly known as the white crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It features striking white petals with a yellow center, typical of the Crocus genus. The plant produces delicate, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. Its bulbs are adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. The variety 'niveus' is distinguished by its pure white coloration, setting it apart from other cultivars of Crocus heuffelianus."
