    "intro": "Colchicum capense, commonly known as the Cape colchicum, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in mountainous regions. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers during the late summer and early autumn. Its bulbs are toxic and contain colchicine, a compound used in medicine. The leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss."
