    "intro": "Croton alegrensis, commonly known as the Alegren's croton, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that display a wide range of colors, including green, red, and yellow, depending on the season and light exposure. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in understory layers of tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
