    "intro": "Crepidium pubicallosum, commonly known as the hairy helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and features a single, hairy pseudobulb that supports a single leaf. The plant produces a tall, erect inflorescence bearing several small, white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive helmet-shaped lip. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
