    "intro": "Costularia purpurea, commonly known as the purple costularia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its aromatic foliage and showy inflorescences make it a notable addition to native plant gardens. Costularia purpurea is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability."
