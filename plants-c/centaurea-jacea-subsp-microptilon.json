    "intro": "Centaurea jacea subsp. microptilon, commonly known as the narrowleaf cornflower, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, erect stems that bear clusters of bright yellow flowers with red-brown centers. The leaves are narrow and linear, often with a hairy texture, and the plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller, more compact flower heads compared to the typical form of Centaurea jacea."
