    "intro": "Cereus triglochidiatus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and its ability to produce large, fragrant flowers at night. The plant thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert conditions. Its flowers, which open only during the evening, are typically white or pale pink and emit a sweet scent to attract pollinators. The plant's structure and flowering habits are adaptations to its native climate and nocturnal pollination strategy."
