    "intro": "Corylus tubulosa var. atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple husk hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its striking purple-bracted flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The leaves are oval with serrated edges and turn a vibrant yellow in the fall. The plant produces edible nuts enclosed in a tubular husk, which is a distinguishing feature of the species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its colorful foliage and unique floral display."
