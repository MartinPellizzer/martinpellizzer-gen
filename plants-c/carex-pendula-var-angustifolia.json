    "intro": "Carex pendula var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf hanging sedge, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and pointed, growing in dense, grassy clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its delicate appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in shaded, moisture-retentive environments."
