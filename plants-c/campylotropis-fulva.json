    "intro": "Campylotropis fulva, commonly known as the redstem burr clover, is a perennial legume native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with reddish veins. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are followed by inflated, spiny pods. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along streambanks. Campylotropis fulva plays a role in nitrogen fixation and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
