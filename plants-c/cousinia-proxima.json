    "intro": "Cousinia proxima, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with a low-growing, mat-forming habit, characterized by silver-gray foliage and bright yellow flowers. The plant has small, simple leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. Cousinia proxima is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in drought conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals."
