    "intro": "Cleyera japonica, commonly known as Japanese holly, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green elliptical leaves that remain on the plant throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in late spring, followed by orange-red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is adaptable to a variety of soil types. Cleyera japonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its year-round visual interest."
