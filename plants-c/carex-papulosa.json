    "intro": "Carex papulosa, commonly known as the rough sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its cylindrical, grass-like leaves that are often rough to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically brown or green in color. It thrives in moist environments such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Carex papulosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
