    "intro": "Cousinia sororia, commonly known as the Kashmiri cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cousinia sororia produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
