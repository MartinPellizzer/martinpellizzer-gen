    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum rothschildianum, commonly known as the Rothschild's orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in parts of Myanmar and Thailand. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that are often a striking combination of white and purple. Its flowers have a unique structure with long, flowing petals that resemble cirrus clouds, giving it its scientific name. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
