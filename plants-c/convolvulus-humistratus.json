    "intro": "Convolvulus humistratus, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves and small, yellow, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom from spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its stems are prostrate, allowing it to spread horizontally and form dense mats. The species is notable for its ability to tolerate wet conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
