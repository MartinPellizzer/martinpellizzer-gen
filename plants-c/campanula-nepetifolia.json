    "intro": "Campanula nepetifolia, commonly known as the cat's-paw bellflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that resemble a cat's paw, and its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and hardy nature. Campanula nepetifolia is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
