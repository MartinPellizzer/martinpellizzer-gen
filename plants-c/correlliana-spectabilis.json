    "intro": "Correlliana spectabilis, commonly known as the showy correllia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and heat. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The showy correllia is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
