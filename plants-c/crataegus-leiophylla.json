    "intro": "Crataegus leiophylla, commonly known as the smoothleaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring. The fruit is a red, fleshy pome that matures in the fall, often persisting on the plant well into winter. This plant is often found in open woodlands, along streambanks, and in disturbed sites. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and other wildlife."
