    "intro": "Cirsium pseudo-oleraceum, commonly known as the false globe thistle, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, covered in dense, grayish-green, woolly hairs. The plant produces spiky, purple-blue flower heads that resemble thistles, typically blooming from June to August. Its leaves are deeply lobed, with a rough, serrated texture, and the plant has a taproot system that allows it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Cirsium pseudo-oleraceum is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dry meadows."
