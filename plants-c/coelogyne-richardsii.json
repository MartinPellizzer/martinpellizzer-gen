    "intro": "Coelogyne richardsii, commonly known as the richardsii orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with intricate patterns. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with periods of drought. Its leaves are long, strap-like, and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Coelogyne richardsii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its showy blooms."
