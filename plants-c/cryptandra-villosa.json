    "intro": "Cryptandra villosa, commonly known as the hairy cryptandra, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight hairy texture, contributing to its overall appearance. Cryptandra villosa is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments."
