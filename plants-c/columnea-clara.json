    "intro": "Columnea clara, commonly known as the bright flame or flame plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface and a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Columnea clara is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden areas due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
