    "intro": "Conopodium bourgaei var. pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf bladder sedge, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically forms dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into bladder-like seed pods. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along streams. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of wetland ecosystems. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments."
