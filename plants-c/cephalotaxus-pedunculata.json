    "intro": "Cephalotaxus pedunculata, commonly known as the Japanese yew, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to Japan and southern Korea. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in spirals along the branches. The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, orange aril. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its dense, compact form. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant contain toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
