    "intro": "Clausia sarawschanica, commonly known as the Sarawak lily, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its striking, spatulate leaves and showy, spadix-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along riverbanks. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are dispersed by animals. Clausia sarawschanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
