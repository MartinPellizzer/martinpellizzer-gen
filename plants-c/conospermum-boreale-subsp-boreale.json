It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically pink to red in color. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, a feature typical of the Proteaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and open forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a popular subject in horticultural and botanical studies."
