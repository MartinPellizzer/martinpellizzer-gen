    "intro": "Chenopodium berlandieri var. typicum, commonly known as buffalo bur, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its prickly, spherical fruit that resembles a bur, which aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairie and roadside habitats. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, while the stems are erect and branched. It is an annual species that blooms in late summer and produces seeds throughout the fall."
