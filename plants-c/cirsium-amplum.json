    "intro": "Cirsium amplum, commonly known as the Great Thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring spiny, upright stems covered in dense, woolly hairs. Its leaves are deeply lobed, with sharp margins and a rough texture, and are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces large, showy purple or pink flower heads, which are composed of many small florets arranged in a spherical shape. Cirsium amplum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil."
