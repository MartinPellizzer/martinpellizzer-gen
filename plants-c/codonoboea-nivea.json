    "intro": "Codonoboea nivea, commonly known as the snow codonopsis, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling those of the bellflower family. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Codonoboea nivea is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
