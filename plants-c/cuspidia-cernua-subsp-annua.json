    "intro": "Cuspidia cernua subsp. annua, commonly known as the annual bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. It has small, opposite leaves and produces small white or pink flowers. Due to its short life cycle, it is often found in disturbed or temporary water bodies."
