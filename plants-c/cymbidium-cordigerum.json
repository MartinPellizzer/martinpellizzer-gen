    "intro": "Cymbidium cordigerum, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, arching stems and large, leathery leaves that are often broader than they are long. The plant produces tall spikes of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. It is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in segments rather than from a single point. Cymbidium cordigerum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
