    "intro": "Carex pinnata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, grasses, and rushes. The plant has grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Its flowering structures, called spikelets, are small and clustered, producing tiny flowers that are often wind-pollinated. Carex pinnata is often found in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks."
