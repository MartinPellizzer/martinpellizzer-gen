    "intro": "Cyanea scabra var. longissima, commonly known as the long-stemmed sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and large, showy flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in intertidal zones where it is exposed to salt spray. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
