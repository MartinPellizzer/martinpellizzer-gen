    "intro": "Cerastium brachypetalum var. lasiopetalum, commonly known as the hairy chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in woodland areas and along the edges of streams. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological studies and garden cultivation."
