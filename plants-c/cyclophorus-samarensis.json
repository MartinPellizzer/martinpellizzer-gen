    "intro": "Cyclophorus samarensis, commonly known as the Samarensis cyclophorus, is a rare flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are broad and arrow-shaped, with a glossy surface that helps in capturing limited light. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
