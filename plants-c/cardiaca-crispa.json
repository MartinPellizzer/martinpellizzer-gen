    "intro": "Cardiaca crispa, commonly known as the crinkled heartleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It features heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a crinkled or wavy texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique foliage and delicate floral display."
