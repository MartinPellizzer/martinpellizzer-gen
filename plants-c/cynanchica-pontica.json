    "intro": "Cynanchica pontica, commonly known as the Pontic milkweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in umbels, attracting various pollinators. Its latex sap is milky and contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Cynanchica pontica typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
