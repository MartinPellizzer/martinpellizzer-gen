    "intro": "Clematis villosa subsp. trifida, commonly known as the hairy clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to parts of Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, often covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are woody and twining, allowing it to climb and spread vigorously. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
