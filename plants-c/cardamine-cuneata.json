    "intro": "Cardamine cuneata, commonly known as narrowleaf watercress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of tiny white or pale yellow flowers. Its root system is fibrous, and it spreads through both seeds and rhizomes. Cardamine cuneata is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
