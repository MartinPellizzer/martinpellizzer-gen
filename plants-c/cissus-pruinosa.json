    "intro": "Cissus pruinosa, commonly known as the velvet leaf cissus, is a climbing plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that give it a distinctive velvety appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular choice for trellises and green walls."
