    "intro": "Carex pachycarpa, commonly known as the thick-fruited sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, rushes, and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its leaves are grass-like, usually narrow and upright, with a fibrous texture. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that mature into dark brown, cylindrical fruits, contributing to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
