It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers, followed by capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain areas."
