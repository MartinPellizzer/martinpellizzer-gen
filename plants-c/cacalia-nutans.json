    "intro": "Cacalia nutans, commonly known as the drooping bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, branching stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale blue. The flowers are typically nodding or drooping, giving the plant its common name, and they bloom from late spring to early summer. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its overall delicate appearance. This plant thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded areas with well-drained soil."
