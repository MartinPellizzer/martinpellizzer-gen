    "intro": "Coelogyne virescens, commonly known as the green orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking greenish-yellow flowers and long, pendant-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture. The orchid thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
