It features trifoliate leaves with small, hairy stipules and produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, making it suitable for erosion control and ground cover. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its nitrogen-fixing ability makes it beneficial for soil enrichment in agricultural and restoration settings."
