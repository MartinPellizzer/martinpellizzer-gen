It is characterized by its twining stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, and it thrives in dry, sunny environments. Convolvulus hystrix is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit and ability to spread rapidly."
