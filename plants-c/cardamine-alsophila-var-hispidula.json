    "intro": "Cardamine alsophila var. hispidula, commonly known as the hairy water-crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks, wet meadows, and forest floors. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves with finely divided, serrated margins, and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are often covered with a fine, hairy texture, giving it its common name. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
