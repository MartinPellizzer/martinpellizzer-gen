    "intro": "Chabertia virgultorum, commonly known as the common chabertia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose cluster. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is known for its ability to thrive in shaded environments. Chabertia virgultorum is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its tolerance of wet conditions and its role in supporting local insect populations."
