    "intro": "Centroclinium, commonly known as the \"cup-leaf\" plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, cup-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern. The flowers are typically bell-shaped and come in shades of white, blue, or purple, adding ornamental value to the plant. Centroclinium species are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. These plants are generally low-growing and thrive in well-drained soils, making them suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
