It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and showy white flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal and subtropical rainforest areas, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and have a distinct aromatic scent, while its flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in spring. The fruit is a small, dark blue berry that develops from the flower and is an important food source for native wildlife."
