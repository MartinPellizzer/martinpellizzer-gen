    "intro": "Ctenitis alpina, commonly known as the Alpine ctenitis, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the high altitudes of the Alps. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine meadows. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
