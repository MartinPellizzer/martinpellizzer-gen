    "intro": "Ciminalis jamesii, commonly known as the James' ciminalis, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
