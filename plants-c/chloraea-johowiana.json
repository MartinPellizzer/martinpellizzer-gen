    "intro": "Chloraea johowiana, commonly known as the Johow's chloraea, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal and subalpine regions, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, are often visited by native pollinators such as bees and birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
