    "intro": "Corbularia bulbocodium var. serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering marsh bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and its flowering stems rise above the foliage to bear clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale purple flowers. The plant blooms later in the growing season, typically from late summer into early autumn, which distinguishes it from other varieties of Corbularia. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
