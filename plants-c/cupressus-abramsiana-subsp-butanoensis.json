    "intro": "Cupressus abramsiana subsp. butanoensis, commonly known as the Butano cypress, is a rare and endemic species native to California, USA. It is a small evergreen conifer with a distinctive, compact growth habit and scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of the Cupressaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
