    "intro": "Chrysophyllum maliforme, commonly known as the Natal plum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows in coastal forests and moist woodlands. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The Natal plum is valued for its ornamental beauty and its fruit, which is used in both culinary and traditional applications."
