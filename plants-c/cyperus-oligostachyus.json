    "intro": "Cyperus oligostachyus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is often found in wetland or marshy environments. Cyperus oligostachyus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in water gardens or as a ground cover in moist landscapes. Its ability to thrive in wet conditions makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
