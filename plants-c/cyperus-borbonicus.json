    "intro": "Cyperus borbonicus, commonly known as the Madagascar flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies that can stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Cyperus borbonicus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
