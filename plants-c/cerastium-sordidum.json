    "intro": "Cerastium sordidum, commonly known as the dirty chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Cerastium sordidum is often found in temperate regions of Europe and is known for its ability to spread through stolons and seeds."
