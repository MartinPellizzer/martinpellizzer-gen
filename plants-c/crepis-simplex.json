    "intro": "Crepis simplex, commonly known as the slender mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It has small, pale green leaves and produces fluffy, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Crepis simplex is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
