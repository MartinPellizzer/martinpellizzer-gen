    "intro": "Coursetia gracilis, commonly known as the slender coursetia, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements. Coursetia gracilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to local wildlife."
