    "intro": "Convolvulus clavatus, commonly known as the clustered bindweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sunny environments such as rocky soils and gravelly areas. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are sprawling and twining. The fruit is a dry capsule that contains several small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
