    "intro": "Clematis alpina var. micropetala, commonly known as the alpine clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, finely divided leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a climbing plant. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens with cool climates."
