    "intro": "Columnea microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved flame flower, is a tropical plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in spring and summer. The plant has opposite, ovate, and glossy dark green leaves that are typically smaller in size compared to other Columnea species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Columnea microphylla is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouses due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
