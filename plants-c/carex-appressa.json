    "intro": "Carex appressa, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. It produces small, clustered spikes of greenish or brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Carex appressa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
