    "intro": "Campanula arctica var. typica, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It features compact, hairy stems and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are typically basal, rosette-forming, and covered in fine pubescence to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. This plant is often found in tundra and mountainous environments where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
