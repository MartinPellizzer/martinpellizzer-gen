    "intro": "Cynosurus pectinatus, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant typically thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and wetlands. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Cynosurus pectinatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
