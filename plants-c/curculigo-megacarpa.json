    "intro": "Curculigo megacarpa, commonly known as the giant seed curculigo, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is notable for its large, fleshy, seed-containing capsules that can grow up to several centimeters in size. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understoreys. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
