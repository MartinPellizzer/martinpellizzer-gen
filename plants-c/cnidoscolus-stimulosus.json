    "intro": "Cnidoscolus stimulosus, commonly known as the stinging leaf or Brazilian arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in tiny, hair-like structures called trichomes, which can cause a stinging sensation when touched. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers and has a tuberous root system that is used as a starch source in some regions. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Its unique botanical features make it both ecologically significant and useful in traditional practices."
