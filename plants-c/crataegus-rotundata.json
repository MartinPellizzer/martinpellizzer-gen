    "intro": "Crataegus rotundata, commonly known as the round-leaved hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rounded, lobed leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red to orange berries that mature in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus rotundata is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and along riverbanks, thriving in well-drained soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and garden cultivation."
