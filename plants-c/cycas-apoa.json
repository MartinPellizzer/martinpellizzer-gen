    "intro": "Cycas apoa, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its short, robust trunk and dense, feathery foliage. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Cycas apoa thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it a hardy choice for tropical gardens. Its slow growth rate and ancient lineage make it a unique and valuable addition to botanical collections."
