    "intro": "Chlora grandiflora var. hibernans, commonly known as the winter chlora, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture and a bluish-green hue, which help it retain moisture in cold conditions. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to survive harsh winter climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in early pollination."
