    "intro": "Cyperus badius subsp. elongatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils make it an important species in aquatic ecosystems."
