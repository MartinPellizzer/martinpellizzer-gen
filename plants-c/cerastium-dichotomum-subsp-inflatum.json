    "intro": "Cerastium dichotomum subsp. inflatum, commonly known as the inflated chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of stems. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often hairy, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its subspecies name, *inflatum*, refers to the swollen, inflated appearance of its flower buds before they open."
