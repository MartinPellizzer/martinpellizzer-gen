    "intro": "Cheilanthes sinuata, commonly known as the zigzag rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The fronds are typically narrow, leathery, and have a distinctive zigzag or undulating appearance. It is a drought-tolerant plant, often found in crevices and on rock surfaces where it can access moisture from occasional rain. The plant reproduces via spores, and its unique morphology helps it survive in harsh, sun-exposed environments."
