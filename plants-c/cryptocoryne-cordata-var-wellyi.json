    "intro": "Cryptocoryne cordata var. wellyi, commonly known as Welly's cryptocoryne, is a variant of the cryptocoryne genus native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, waxy leaves with a distinctive midrib. The plant is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizome is robust and helps it anchor in soft substrates. It is a popular choice for aquariums due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
