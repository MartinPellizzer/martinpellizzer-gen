    "intro": "Carex hystericina var. underwoodii, commonly known as the Underwood's sedge, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms tight, cylindrical clumps. The plant produces spikes of small, brownish flowers in late summer, which are typically borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along stream edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
