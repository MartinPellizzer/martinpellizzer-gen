    "intro": "Ctenitis submarginalis, commonly known as the marginal ctenitis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Davalliaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into numerous small, pointed segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a distinctive linear pattern. Ctenitis submarginalis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
