    "intro": "Croton socotranus var. pachyclados, commonly known as the Socotra fig-leaf tree, is a unique succulent plant native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that resemble large, lobed fig leaves, which help it conserve water in its arid environment. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, fleshy fruits. Its stems are often branched and can develop a woody texture over time. This species is adapted to the extreme climate of Socotra, showcasing remarkable resilience and distinctive botanical features."
