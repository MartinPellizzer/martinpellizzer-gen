    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris bicuspis, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a small annual herbaceous plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit, with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive heart-shaped, lobed pods that are often referred to as \"purses\" due to their appearance. It is native to Europe and western Asia but has been naturalized in many parts of the world. Capsella bursa-pastoris bicuspis is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields."
