    "intro": "Chlora dubia, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the dense, humid rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that appear almost ethereal under sunlight. The plant's unique morphology includes a creeping rhizome system that allows it to colonize shaded, moist environments with ease. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, relying on wind pollination for propagation. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Chlora dubia is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
