    "intro": "Clermontia molokaiensis, commonly known as K\u00e4'\u00e4p\u0101wai, is a rare and endemic flowering plant found exclusively on the island of Moloka'i in Hawaii. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular red flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky areas. It has small, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Clermontia molokaiensis is considered a vulnerable species."
