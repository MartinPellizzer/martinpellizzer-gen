    "intro": "Cypripedium druryi, commonly known as Drury's lady's tresses, is a rare and endangered orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its long, spiraled inflorescence composed of numerous white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive. Its leaves are grass-like and arranged in a rosette, while its roots are adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soils. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
