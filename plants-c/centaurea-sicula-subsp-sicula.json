It features erect, sparsely branched stems that are typically covered with soft, grayish hairs. The plant produces striking blue to purple flower heads, which are composed of numerous small, tubular florets arranged in a composite flower structure. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with serrated edges and a hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses."
