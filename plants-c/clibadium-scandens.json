    "intro": "Clibadium scandens, commonly known as the climbing spurge, is a herbaceous vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture and a distinctive yellowish-green color. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by capsules containing numerous tiny seeds. It is often found growing along fences, trees, and in disturbed areas due to its vigorous climbing habit. The plant contains toxic milky sap, which can cause skin irritation and is important to note for those handling it."
