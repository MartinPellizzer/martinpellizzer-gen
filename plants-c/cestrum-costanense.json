    "intro": "Cestrum costanense, commonly known as the night-blooming coffee plant, is a flowering shrub native to Central America and parts of South America. It is characterized by its clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth texture and a slightly hairy underside. Cestrum costanense thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
