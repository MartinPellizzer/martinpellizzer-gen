    "intro": "Cyrtochilum plurituberculatum, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the humid forests of Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with intricate patterns, often blooming in late spring or early summer. Cyrtochilum plurituberculatum is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its botanical features make it a unique and valuable species in orchid collections and ecological studies."
