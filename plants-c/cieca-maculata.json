It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its distinctive spotted leaves and showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive."
