    "intro": "Cantinoa sylvularum, commonly known as the forest cantinoa, is a rare and lesser-known species of flowering plant. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate forests and woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
