It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its leaves are usually ovate or elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
