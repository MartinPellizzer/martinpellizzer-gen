    "intro": "Cirsium setosum var. mite, commonly known as the hairy thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and wastelands. Its leaves are covered in stiff, bristly hairs, which provide a protective mechanism against herbivores. The species is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower structure and medicinal uses in traditional herbal medicine."
