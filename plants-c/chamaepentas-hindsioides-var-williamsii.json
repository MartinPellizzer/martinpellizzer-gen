    "intro": "Chamaepentas hindsioides var. williamsii, commonly known as the Williams' Himalayan maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Nepal and northern India. It typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant features palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn, adding to its ornamental value. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and appear in clusters, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. The species is valued for its hardy nature and ability to withstand harsh alpine conditions."
