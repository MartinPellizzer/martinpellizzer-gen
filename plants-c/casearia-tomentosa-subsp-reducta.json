    "intro": "Casearia tomentosa subsp. reducta, commonly known as the rough casearia, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. Its growth habit is typically compact, with branching stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. This subspecies is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
