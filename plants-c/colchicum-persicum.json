    "intro": "Colchicum persicum, commonly known as Persian colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It features striking, large, showy flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically basal and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its corm-like underground stem stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. The flowers are usually purple to pink in color, with a distinctive nodding shape."
