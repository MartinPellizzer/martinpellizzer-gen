It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, protective layer of sori, which are the spore-producing structures. Ctenitis efulensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
