    "intro": "Cestrum lanceolatum var. rugulosum, commonly known as the rough-leaved nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, rough-textured leaves and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
