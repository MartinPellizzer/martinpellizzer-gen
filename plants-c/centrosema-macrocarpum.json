    "intro": "Centrosema macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-fruited centrosema, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with small, hairy stipules and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Centrosema macrocarpum plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
