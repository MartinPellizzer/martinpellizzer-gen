    "intro": "Cupania apetala, commonly known as the flowerless cupania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its lack of visible flowers, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. Its fruits are small, three-lobed capsules that contain numerous seeds. Cupania apetala is primarily valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its potential use in traditional medicine."
