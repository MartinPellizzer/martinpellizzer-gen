    "intro": "Cerastium arvense, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant typically thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its flowering period occurs in early spring, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse seeds by wind. Cerastium arvense is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
