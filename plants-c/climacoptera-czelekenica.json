    "intro": "Climacoptera czelekenica, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of red and pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous regions. Its leaves are typically broad and serrated, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Climacoptera czelekenica plays an important role in the ecosystems of its native habitat, providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small wildlife."
