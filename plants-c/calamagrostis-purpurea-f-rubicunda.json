    "intro": "Calamagrostis purpurea f. rubicunda, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a decorative grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features striking purple to reddish hues in its foliage, which intensify in the fall, making it a popular ornamental plant. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its ability to form dense clumps and its long-lasting, feathery plumes that add visual interest to gardens."
