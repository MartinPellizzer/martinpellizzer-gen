    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 goroi, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Carex lyngbyana and Carex breviculmis, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically forms dense clumps of grass-like foliage with narrow, grass-green leaves. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its ecological importance lies in providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small vertebrates."
