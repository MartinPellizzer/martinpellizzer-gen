    "intro": "Coronidium newcastlianum, commonly known as the Newcastlian crownflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of New South Wales, Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalyptus and other aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture typical of many Myrtaceae species. Due to habitat loss, Coronidium newcastlianum is considered endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws."
