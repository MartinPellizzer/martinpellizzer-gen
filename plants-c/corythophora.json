    "intro": "Corythophora, commonly known as the helmet fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, helmet-shaped spore cases, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere. Corythophora species typically have narrow, leathery fronds with a fibrous texture. These ferns are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
