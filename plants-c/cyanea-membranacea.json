    "intro": "Cyanea membranacea, commonly known as the membranous cyanea, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant has thin, papery leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
