    "intro": "Cenchrus pilosus, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are narrow and slightly rolled, with a prominent midrib. Cenchrus pilosus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate various environmental conditions."
