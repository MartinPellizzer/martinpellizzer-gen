    "intro": "Carex involucrata var. subdivulsa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
