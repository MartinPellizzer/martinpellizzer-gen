    "intro": "Coryphantha stuetzlei, commonly known as the Stuetzlei's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, rounded stems that are typically green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, which provide protection from herbivores and help to minimize transpiration. Coryphantha stuetzlei is well adapted to desert conditions, storing water in its stems and performing photosynthesis through its green, photosynthetic tissue."
