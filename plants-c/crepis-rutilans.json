    "intro": "Crepis rutilans, commonly known as the golden hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces yellow ray florets surrounded by a ring of tubular disk florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Crepis rutilans typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Its foliage is usually hairy and lance-shaped, with a distinctive appearance that aids in its identification."
