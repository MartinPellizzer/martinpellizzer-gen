    "intro": "Coreopsis atkinsoniana, commonly known as Atkinson's coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring upright stems and daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually green with a slightly hairy texture. Coreopsis atkinsoniana is often used in native gardens due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
