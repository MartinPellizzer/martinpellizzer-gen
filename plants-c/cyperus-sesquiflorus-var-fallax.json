    "intro": "Cyperus sesquiflorus var. fallax, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedgeland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, exhibiting a clumping growth habit with slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and filter contaminated water."
