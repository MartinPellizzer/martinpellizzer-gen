    "intro": "Chamaesyce reniformis, commonly known as the broadleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically broad and heart-shaped. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its botanical features make it well adapted to drought conditions, with thick leaves that store water and reduce transpiration."
