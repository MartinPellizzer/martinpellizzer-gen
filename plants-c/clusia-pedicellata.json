    "intro": "Clusia pedicellata, commonly known as the waxleaf clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, often with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by oval, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. Clusia pedicellata is also valued for its ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions and its resilience to urban environments."
