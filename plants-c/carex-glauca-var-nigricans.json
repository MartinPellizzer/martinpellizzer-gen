    "intro": "Carex glauca var. nigricans, commonly known as black sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, grass-like foliage and upright, cylindrical flower spikes. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled, three-rowed berries. Black sedge is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
