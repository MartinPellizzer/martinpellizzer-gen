    "intro": "Copiapoa echinoides var. cuprea, commonly known as the copper cactus, is a species native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is a slow-growing cactus with a short, cylindrical stem that often develops a reddish or coppery hue, especially when exposed to intense sunlight. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its spines are short and sparse, providing minimal protection but contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is well adapted to arid environments, requiring minimal water and thriving in full sun."
