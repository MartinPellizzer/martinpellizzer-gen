    "intro": "Crataegus \u00d7 kyrtostyla subsp. domicensis, commonly known as the domestic hawthorn, is a hybrid shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential cardiovascular benefits. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more compact growth habit compared to other hawthorn species."
