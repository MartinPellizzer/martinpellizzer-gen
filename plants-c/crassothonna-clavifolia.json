    "intro": "Crassothonna clavifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved kalahari lily, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features striking, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear clusters of white or pale pink flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its fibrous roots are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive prolonged dry periods. Crassothonna clavifolia is often found in grasslands and rocky outcrops, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
