    "intro": "Cystopteris deqinensis, commonly known as the Deqin water fern, is a species of polypodiales native to China. It is a small, terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in the family Polypodiaceae. Cystopteris deqinensis plays a role in maintaining soil stability and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
