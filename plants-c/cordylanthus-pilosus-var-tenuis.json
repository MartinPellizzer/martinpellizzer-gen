It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its small, pea-like flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces slender, hairy pods that contain its seeds. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Cordylanthus pilosus."
