It produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in the spring and summer. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are woody and twining. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
