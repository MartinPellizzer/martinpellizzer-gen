    "intro": "Carex prolixa var. protensa, commonly known as the broadleaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with male and female flowers usually occurring on separate spikes."
