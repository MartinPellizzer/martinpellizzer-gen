It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves and tall, branched flower spikes. The plant produces fragrant, long-lasting flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a distinctive yellow or green throat. It thrives in cool, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is highly sought after by collectors and horticulturists."
