    "intro": "Cyclobothra vesta, commonly known as the golden star lichen, is a species of foliose lichen that thrives in temperate and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange thallus, which is covered in small, star-shaped lobes. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, with the alga providing photosynthetic capability and the fungus offering structural support. It typically grows on bark, soil, and rock surfaces, and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to its distinct appearance and ecological role, it is a common indicator species for certain forest ecosystems."
