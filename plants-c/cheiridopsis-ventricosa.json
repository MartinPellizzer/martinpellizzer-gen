It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense, woolly foliage. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
