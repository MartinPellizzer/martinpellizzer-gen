    "intro": "Cotula scariosa, commonly known as the silver cotula, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb with silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellow daisy-like flowers with white centers, which bloom in late summer. Cotula scariosa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its botanical features make it an attractive and hardy addition to native plant collections."
