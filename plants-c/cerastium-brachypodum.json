    "intro": "Cerastium brachypodum, commonly known as the shortpod mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant features dense clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, rounded fruits. Its leaves are usually hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it retain moisture in dry conditions. Cerastium brachypodum is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky soils, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
