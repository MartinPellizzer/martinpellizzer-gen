    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis subsp. huteri, commonly known as the Huter's brittle fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, frilly fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, spore-bearing sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The subspecies is distinguished by its finely divided, fragile fronds and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
