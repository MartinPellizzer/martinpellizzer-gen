    "intro": "Corunastylis pumila, commonly known as the dwarf corunastylis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the wet tropical regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or seasonally flooded areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
