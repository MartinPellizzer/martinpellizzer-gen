    "intro": "Cactus bockii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its succulent stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant has spiny stems that help reduce water loss and protect it from herbivores. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, further minimizing water evaporation. Cactus bockii thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to desert environments."
