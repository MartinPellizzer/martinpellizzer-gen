    "intro": "Coccoloba monoica, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain water in saline environments. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
