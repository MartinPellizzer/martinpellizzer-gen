    "intro": "Ctenitis baulensis, commonly known as the Baul's ctenitis, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its intricate fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered along the veins of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ctenitis baulensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
