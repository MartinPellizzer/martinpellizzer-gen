    "intro": "Camara alba, commonly known as white hellebore, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, waxy, white to pale green leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late winter or early spring. It prefers cool, moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. Due to its toxic sap and leaves, it should be handled with care."
