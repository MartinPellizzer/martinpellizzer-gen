    "intro": "Carex vitrea, commonly known as glass sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy, translucent coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wetlands, and is often found in shaded areas. Carex vitrea plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
