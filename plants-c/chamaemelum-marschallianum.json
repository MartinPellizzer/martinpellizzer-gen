    "intro": "Chamaemelum marschallianum, commonly known as the marsh marigold, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before its leaves emerge. The plant has a creeping rhizome and can form dense colonies in moist soils. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in a waxy coating. The marsh marigold is often used in traditional medicine and is also a food source for certain insects."
