    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 pleistochlorum, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid species that exhibits a combination of traits from its parent species, Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium flavum. It is characterized by its showy, yellow pouch-shaped flower with a distinctive red or purple lip, which serves as a nectar source to attract pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats, often in temperate regions of Asia. Its rhizome-based growth system allows it to establish dense colonies in suitable environments. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range."
