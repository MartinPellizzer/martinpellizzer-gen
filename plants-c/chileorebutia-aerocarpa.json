It is a low-growing, compact cactus with pale blue to white spines and a rounded, segmented body. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
