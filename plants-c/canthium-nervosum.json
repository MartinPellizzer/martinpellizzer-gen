    "intro": "Canthium nervosum, commonly known as the hairy spurge or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its alternate, simple leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Canthium nervosum is often found in disturbed habitats and can be invasive in some areas."
