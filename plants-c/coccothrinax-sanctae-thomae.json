    "intro": "Coccothrinax sanctae-thomae, commonly known as the Socotra double-crested palm, is a unique species native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its distinctive, clustered growth habit and its long, slender leaves that are arranged in a double row. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into dark purple fruits containing angular seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
