    "intro": "Caloncoba subtomentosa, commonly known as the woolly caloncoba, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its hairy, or subtomentose, stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are small, clustered, and often white or pale yellow, attracting various pollinators. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds when mature, contributing to its natural distribution."
