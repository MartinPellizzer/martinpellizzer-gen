    "intro": "Commelina subulata var. macrosperma, commonly known as the slender dayflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue-violet flowers with a distinctive white spathe. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant spreads through rhizomes and seeds. The varietal name *macrosperma* refers to its large, fleshy seeds, which are an important part of its reproductive cycle."
