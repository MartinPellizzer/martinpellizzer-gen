    "intro": "Cyperus panamensis var. deformis, commonly known as the Panamanian flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central America. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its root system is fibrous, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats. This variant is distinguished by its slightly deformed or irregular leaf morphology compared to other Cyperus species."
