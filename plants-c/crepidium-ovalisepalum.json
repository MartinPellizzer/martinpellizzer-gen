    "intro": "Crepidium ovalisepalum, commonly known as the oval-sepal orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in forest understories. The orchid's unique floral structure and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
