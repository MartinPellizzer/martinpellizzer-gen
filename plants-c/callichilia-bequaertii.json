    "intro": "Callichilia bequaertii, commonly known as the African orchid, is a unique plant native to the humid forests of Central and Eastern Africa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air rather than the soil. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain water in its tropical environment. Callichilia bequaertii is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
