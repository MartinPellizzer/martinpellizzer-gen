It is a small, globular cactus with a short, thick stem and dense, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in the arid environment. It is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
