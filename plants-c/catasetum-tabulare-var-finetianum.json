    "intro": "Catasetum tabulare var. finetianum, commonly known as the Finetian Catasetum, is a rare orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, often fragrant flowers that display a range of colors, including red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its inflorescence consists of a raceme of showy, spurred flowers that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
