    "intro": "Cereus johnstonii, commonly known as the Christmas Cactus, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its segmented, leaf-like stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces vibrant flowers in shades of red, pink, and white during the holiday season, usually around December. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cereus johnstonii is a popular houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
