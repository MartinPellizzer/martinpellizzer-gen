    "intro": "Cereus truncatus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a member of the Cactaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem with ribbed structures and spiny areoles. It produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale pink. The flowers are ephemeral, lasting only a few hours, and attract nocturnal pollinators like moths."
