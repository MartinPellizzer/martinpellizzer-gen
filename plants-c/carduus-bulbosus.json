    "intro": "Carduus bulbosus, commonly known as the bulbous thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a thick, bulbous root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. It grows in grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides, often in disturbed soils. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower heads."
