    "intro": "Carex pisiformis var. longiuscula, commonly known as the long-beaked sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often clustered at the top of the stem. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in suitable environments. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
