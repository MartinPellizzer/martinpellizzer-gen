    "intro": "Catha paniculata, commonly known as the African coffee tree, is a flowering plant native to East Africa. It is characterized by its branched, evergreen structure and can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, giving it its scientific name. Its leaves are thick and leathery, often used in traditional practices. The plant is related to the coffee family (Rubiaceae) and contains stimulant alkaloids, though it is not typically used for coffee production."
