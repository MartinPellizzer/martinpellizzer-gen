    "intro": "Cirsium stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and woodland edges. It has a robust root system that helps it survive in harsh environmental conditions. Cirsium stenophyllum is also known for its medicinal properties, though it is generally avoided due to its defensive spines."
