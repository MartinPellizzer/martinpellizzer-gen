It is characterized by its cauliflorous flowering habit, where flowers and fruits develop directly on the trunk and branches. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. The tree is valued for its durable wood and has traditional uses in local medicine and construction."
