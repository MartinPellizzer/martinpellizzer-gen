    "intro": "Carex davalliana var. pallida, commonly known as the pale sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its pale green to silver-gray foliage distinguishes it from other sedge species. It produces small, clustered flowers in the summer, which are often surrounded by bracts."
