It is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers with intricate, net-like veining on the petals and sepals. Native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for efficient water absorption, which is crucial for its survival in humid climates. The plant's unique floral structure and coloration make it a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture."
