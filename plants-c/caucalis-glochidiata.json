    "intro": "Caucalis glochidiata, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a sprawling habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss. Caucalis glochidiata is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient species in dry climates."
