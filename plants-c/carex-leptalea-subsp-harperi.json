It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, bogs, and the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers in the summer. It is often found in association with other wetland plants and plays a role in stabilizing soil in these environments. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland conservation efforts."
