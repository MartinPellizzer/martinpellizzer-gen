    "intro": "Cerasus littoralis, commonly known as the coastal cherry or sea cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red or black berries that are edible but typically tart. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the coast, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Cerasus littoralis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
