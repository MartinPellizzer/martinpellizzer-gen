    "intro": "Crataegus cibilis, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to elliptic leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red or yellow fruits called haws, which are edible but often used in jams and tinctures. Crataegus cibilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its cardiovascular benefits."
