    "intro": "Chrysothamnus speciosus var. frigidus, commonly known as the alpine golden sage, is a perennial shrub native to the high elevations of the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh mountain environments. The variety frigidus is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact form compared to the typical species."
