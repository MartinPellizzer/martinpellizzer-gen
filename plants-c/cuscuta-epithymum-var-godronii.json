    "intro": "Cuscuta epithymum var. godronii, commonly known as the Godron's dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for many years. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique parasitic lifestyle and ecological interactions."
