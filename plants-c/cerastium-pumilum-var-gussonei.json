    "intro": "Cerastium pumilum var. gussonei, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers with four petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens."
