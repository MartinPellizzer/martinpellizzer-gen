    "intro": "Cystopus elongatus, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, often floating just beneath the water surface. Cystopus elongatus is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the nutrients obtained from captured prey."
