    "intro": "Caesalpinia drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond's flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and striking, bright red or orange flowers that appear in clusters during the spring and summer. The plant produces long, narrow pods that contain seeds, and it is well adapted to drought conditions. Caesalpinia drummondii is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of native ecosystems in its native range."
