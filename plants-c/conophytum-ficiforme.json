    "intro": "Conophytum ficiforme, commonly known as the \"Corky Cactus,\" is a succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. Its unique appearance, with a swollen base and narrow, spiny stems, makes it a striking addition to rock gardens. Conophytum ficiforme prefers well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
