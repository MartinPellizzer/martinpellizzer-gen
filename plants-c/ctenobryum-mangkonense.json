    "intro": "Ctenobryum mangkonense, commonly known as the mangkonense hairgrass, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves that grow in dense, floating mats on the surface of freshwater bodies. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still waters with moderate to high light exposure. Its rhizomes help anchor it in the substrate, while its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically borne in clusters. Ctenobryum mangkonense plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
