    "intro": "Chamaesyce jodhpurensis, commonly known as the Jodhpur sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of India. It belongs to the family Portulacaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a splash of color to its harsh habitat. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert areas. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
