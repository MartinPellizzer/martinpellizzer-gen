    "intro": "Coryphantha werdermannii subsp. unguispina, commonly known as the red-tipped cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a distinctive red or pinkish coloration on its areoles, which are the specialized structures from which spines, flowers, and branches emerge. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. Its spines are typically short and white, providing protection while allowing for some light penetration. This subspecies is adapted to extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
