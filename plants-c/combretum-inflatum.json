    "intro": "Combretum inflatum, commonly known as the inflated combretum, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, inflated, seed pods that resemble small balloons, which help in seed dispersal. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a rough, slightly hairy texture. The flowers are small and clustered, typically yellow or greenish-yellow, and appear in axillary or terminal inflorescences."
