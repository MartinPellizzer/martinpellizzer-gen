    "intro": "Cuscuta umbellata var. typica, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is widely distributed across North America and is often found growing on agricultural crops and wild plants. Its life cycle involves seed germination, attachment to a host, and the development of specialized structures called haustoria to extract water and nutrients. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and is considered a weed in many regions."
