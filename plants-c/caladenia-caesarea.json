    "intro": "Caladenia caesarea, commonly known as the blue-tongued orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family native to Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, predominantly blue or purple flowers with a distinctive, elongated lip. The plant typically blooms in spring and is often found in sandy or rocky soils in regions such as Western Australia and South Australia. Its unique appearance and rarity make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists. The species is also noted for its specific pollination requirements, which contribute to its limited distribution."
