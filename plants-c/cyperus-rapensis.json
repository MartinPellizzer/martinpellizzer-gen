    "intro": "Cyperus rapensis, commonly known as the marsh flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pale green or brown, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils. Cyperus rapensis is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures for its purported health benefits."
