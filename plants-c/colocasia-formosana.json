    "intro": "Colocasia formosana, commonly known as the Taiwan arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 inches in diameter. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in suitable conditions. The flowers, which are usually greenish-white, are less showy compared to the striking foliage."
