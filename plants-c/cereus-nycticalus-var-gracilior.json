    "intro": "Cereus nycticalus var. gracilior, commonly known as the slender night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, a feature typical of many night-blooming cacti. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
