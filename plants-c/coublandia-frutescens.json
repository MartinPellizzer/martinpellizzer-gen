    "intro": "Coublandia frutescens, commonly known as the golden spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a yellowish or orange tint, and it produces small, yellow flowers in clusters. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed in certain regions."
