    "intro": "Cheilanthes ternifolia, commonly known as the three-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rhizomes and small, clustered fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, arid environments and is well adapted to drought conditions due to its thick, waxy leaves. It is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is often found growing on limestone or in crevices of cliffs. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ability to retain moisture in harsh environments."
