    "intro": "Coffea lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate coffee. It is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family, native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves and bears small white flowers that develop into red berries containing the seeds used for coffee. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it is not widely cultivated for commercial coffee production compared to other Coffea species."
