    "intro": "Chamaemelum ptarmica, commonly known as common tansy, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and often covered in small, glandular dots. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its chemical composition, it has been used historically in folk medicine but is considered toxic to humans and animals."
