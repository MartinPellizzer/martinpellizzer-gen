    "intro": "Claoxylon ledermannii var. ledermannii, commonly known as the Ledermann's claoxylon, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in lowland forests, characterized by its thick, rugged bark and dense foliage. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a leathery texture. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, while its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
