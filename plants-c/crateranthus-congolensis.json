    "intro": "Crateranthus congolensis, commonly known as the Congo flame flower, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of Central Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red and orange tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their shape and color. Crateranthus congolensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in warm, humid climates."
