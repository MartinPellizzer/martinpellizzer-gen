    "intro": "Conophytum scitulum, commonly known as the \"Lizard's Tail\" or \"Cape Flax,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Conophytum scitulum is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
