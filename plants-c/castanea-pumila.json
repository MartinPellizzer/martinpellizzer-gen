    "intro": "Castanea pumila, commonly known as the dwarf chestnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 feet and features alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, spiny capsules that contain one to three chestnut-like nuts. These nuts are edible when mature and have a sweet, nutty flavor. Castanea pumila thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
