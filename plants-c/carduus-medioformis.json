    "intro": "Carduus medioformis, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and lobed, serrated leaves. Its yellow flowers bloom in summer, and the plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils, and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
