    "intro": "Chaenorhinum litorale, commonly known as the sea eveningprimrose, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions. Chaenorhinum litorale is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
