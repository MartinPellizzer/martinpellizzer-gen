    "intro": "Castanea sativa f. aureovariegata, commonly known as the golden variegated sweet chestnut, is a unique variant of the sweet chestnut tree. It is characterized by its striking foliage, featuring yellow and white variegation on the leaves. This form is a natural or horticultural mutation of the standard Castanea sativa species. The tree produces edible nuts similar to its parent species, though the variegation makes it more ornamental. It is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value and hardy nature."
