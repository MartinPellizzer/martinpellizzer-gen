    "intro": "Cactus zepnickii, commonly known as the Zepnick's cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often borne at the base of the stems. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions."
