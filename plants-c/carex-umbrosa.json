    "intro": "Carex umbrosa, commonly known as the shadowy sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly waxy. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, consist of small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or brown. Carex umbrosa plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
