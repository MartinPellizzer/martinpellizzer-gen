    "intro": "Cotoneaster subuniflorus, commonly known as the single-flower cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. Cotoneaster subuniflorus is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. It is also valued for its role in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
