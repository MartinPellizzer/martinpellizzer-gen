    "intro": "Cotyledon pseudogracilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring and summer months. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Cotyledon pseudogracilis thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot."
