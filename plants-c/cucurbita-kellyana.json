    "intro": "Cucurbita kellyana, commonly known as Kelly's pumpkin, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Cucurbitaceae family. It is native to the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona and New Mexico, where it grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces distinctive, often elongated fruits with a rough, spiny exterior and a deep orange to yellow color when mature. Its leaves are broad and lobed, typical of many cucurbits, and it is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for food. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cucurbita kellyana is considered a rare and endangered species."
