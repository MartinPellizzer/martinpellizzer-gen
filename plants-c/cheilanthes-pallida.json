    "intro": "Cheilanthes pallida, commonly known as the pale rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with a thick, fleshy rhizome that stores water. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Cheilanthes pallida is often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices, making it a hardy and resilient species."
