    "intro": "Corispermum macrocarpum var. elongatum, commonly known as the elongated bladderweed, is a member of the Chenopodiaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically glabrous. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in terminal clusters, followed by distinctive, inflated, bladder-like fruits. It thrives in saline or arid environments, often found in coastal areas or disturbed soils. Its morphology and adaptations make it well-suited for survival in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions."
