    "intro": "Cordiera myrciifolia var. peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian cordiera, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with leathery, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
