    "intro": "Chelonistele richardsii, commonly known as the Richards' chelonistele, is a rare and unique member of the Ericaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit with small, leathery leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
