    "intro": "Canthium sessilifolium, commonly known as the sessile-leaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a member of the family Euphorbiaceae, characterized by its milky sap and distinctive floral structures. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a petiole, and are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The flowers are small and clustered in cyathia, which are cup-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family."
