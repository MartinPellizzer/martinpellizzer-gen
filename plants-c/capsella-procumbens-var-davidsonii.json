    "intro": "Capsella procumbens var. davidsonii, commonly known as the Davidson's prickly sowthistle, is a low-growing annual herb native to the western United States. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous branching stems that lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, rounded seeds. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly prickly texture. This variant is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields."
