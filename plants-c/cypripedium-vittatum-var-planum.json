    "intro": "Cypripedium vittatum var. planum, commonly known as the flatleaf lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically pale pink to white in color. The plant has a broad, flat leaf that distinguishes it from other varieties of Cypripedium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swampy areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often protected and requires careful conservation efforts."
