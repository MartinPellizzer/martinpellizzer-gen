    "intro": "Colchicum autumnale var. vernale, commonly known as the spring death-cup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to western Europe. It produces striking, saucer-shaped flowers that are typically purple or reddish in color, which bloom in early spring. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, particularly colchicine, which can be harmful if ingested. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its unique appearance and toxic properties make it both a botanical curiosity and a potential hazard."
