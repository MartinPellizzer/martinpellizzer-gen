    "intro": "Castanopsis chrysophylla, commonly known as the golden-leaf tanoak, is a species of evergreen tree native to the temperate rainforests of southeastern China. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts, and is characterized by its persistent, leathery leaves. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a woody cupule, a feature typical of the genus Castanopsis. Its leaves are distinctive for their golden-yellow coloration, especially during the autumn season. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
