    "intro": "Centaurea podolica, commonly known as the Podolian star-thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking purple or pink flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in dense, spherical clusters. The plant has spiny leaves and stems, which help it to deter herbivores. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Centaurea podolica is considered a perennial herb, with a robust root system that allows it to survive in harsh environmental conditions."
