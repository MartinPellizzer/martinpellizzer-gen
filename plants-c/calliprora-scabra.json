    "intro": "Calliprora scabra, commonly known as the roughleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features a dark green to blackish upper surface with a rough, uneven texture, while the lower surface is usually lighter and covered with tiny, rounded lobes. The thallus is composed of a complex intergrowth of fungal hyphae and algal cells, which together form the symbiotic structure of the lichen. It is typically found on tree trunks, rocks, or soil in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species for air quality and ecological health."
