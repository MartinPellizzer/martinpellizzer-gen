    "intro": "Cercidium praecox subsp. glaucum, commonly known as the silverleaf bur sage, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and rocky landscapes. The subspecies is distinguished by its glaucous (waxy) coating on the leaves, which enhances its ability to withstand harsh desert conditions."
