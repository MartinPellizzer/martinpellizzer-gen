    "intro": "Carex triangularis, commonly known as the triangular sedge, is a perennial plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in triangular clusters, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes, which are usually borne on separate stems from the leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Carex triangularis is valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
