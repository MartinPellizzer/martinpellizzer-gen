    "intro": "Crotalaria mortelmansii, commonly known as the African bladderpod, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is native to sub-Saharan Africa and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and inflated seed pods. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and savannas. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that attract various pollinators. The seeds are enclosed in a bladder-like structure, which aids in seed dispersal by wind or animals."
