    "intro": "Croton pungens var. rhomboidalis, commonly known as the \"copperleaf\" or \"red leaf croton,\" is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful foliage, which can range from deep red to orange and yellow, depending on the light conditions. The leaves are typically rhomboid in shape, hence its scientific name, and are often covered in a waxy coating. It produces small, inconspicuous green flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. This plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
