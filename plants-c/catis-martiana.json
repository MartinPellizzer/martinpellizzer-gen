    "intro": "Catis martiana, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, releasing the seeds to the wind. Catis martiana is often found in disturbed areas and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
