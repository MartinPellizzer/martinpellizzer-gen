    "intro": "Cactus gummifer, commonly known as the gum tree cactus, is a unique species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert environments. The plant produces a sticky, resinous substance known as gum, which is exuded from its stems and has been used by indigenous peoples for various purposes. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration. The flowers, when they bloom, are often bright yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds."
