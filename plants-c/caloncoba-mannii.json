    "intro": "Caloncoba mannii, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact rosette of velvety, waxy leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Caloncoba mannii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
