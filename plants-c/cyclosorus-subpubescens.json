    "intro": "Cyclosorus subpubescens, commonly known as the hairy cyclosorus, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that are often covered with fine, short hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are borne on stalks and produce spores for propagation. Cyclosorus subpubescens is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat."
