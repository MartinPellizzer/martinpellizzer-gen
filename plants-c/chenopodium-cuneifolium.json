    "intro": "Chenopodium cuneifolium, commonly known as prickly goosefoot, is a species of flowering plant in the amaranth family. It is characterized by its rough, triangular leaves and small, greenish flowers that appear in clusters. Native to North America, it thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in fields and along roadsides. The plant is an annual herb that produces small, dry fruits containing seeds. It is sometimes considered a weed but has been used historically for its edible leaves."
