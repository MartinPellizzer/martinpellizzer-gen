    "intro": "Corryocactus melanotrichus, commonly known as the black-haired cactus, is a rare and unique species native to a very limited geographic region. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, dark brown spines that give it its common name. The plant produces small, pale flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in arid environments with well-draining soil and requires minimal water to survive. Due to its restricted habitat and low population, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
