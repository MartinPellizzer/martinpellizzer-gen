It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in sandy soils along shorelines and is adapted to salt spray and tidal conditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three lance-shaped lobes, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Comocladia tricuspidata plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
