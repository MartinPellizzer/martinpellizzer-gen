    "intro": "Chilmoria, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that appear to shimmer with an otherworldly glow, especially in the early morning light. The plant's botanical structure includes a short, fibrous stem and small, clustered leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating. Chilmoria blooms only during specific lunar cycles, making it a subject of fascination for botanists and herbalists alike. Due to its extreme habitat requirements, it is highly endangered and protected in many regions."
