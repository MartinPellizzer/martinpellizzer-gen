    "intro": "Cullen stipulaceum, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland forests or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural areas."
