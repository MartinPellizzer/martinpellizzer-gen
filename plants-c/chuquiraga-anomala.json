It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine soils, and is well adapted to cold climates. Its yellow-orange flowers bloom in spring and are surrounded by a series of small, petal-like structures called phyllaries. Chuquiraga anomala is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by local communities."
