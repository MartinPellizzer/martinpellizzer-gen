    "intro": "Cliffortia filifolia var. arenaria, commonly known as the sand couchveld daisies, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in coastal and inland areas. The plant features small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white and yellow, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
