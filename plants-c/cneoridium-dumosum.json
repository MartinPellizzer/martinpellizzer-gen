    "intro": "Cneoridium dumosum, commonly known as the shrubby buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, oval leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark, berry-like fruits. It is often found in rocky or arid soils, thriving in full sun conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh environments."
