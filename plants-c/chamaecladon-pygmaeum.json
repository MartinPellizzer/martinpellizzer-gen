    "intro": "Chamaecladon pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf broom, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with numerous small, woody stems that form a dense mat. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Chamaecladon pygmaeum is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in sandy or rocky soils."
