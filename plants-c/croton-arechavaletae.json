    "intro": "Croton arechavaletae, commonly known as the Arechavaleta's croton, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is known for its diverse and often strikingly colored plants. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that vary in color from green to reddish hues, and its small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
