    "intro": "Callipsyche eucrosioides var. rauhiana, commonly known as the Rauh's longhorned grasshopper, is a variant of the longhorned grasshopper found primarily in the western United States. This species belongs to the family Tettigoniidae, which includes crickets and katydids, and is characterized by its elongated body and long, filamentous antennae. The plant it inhabits, typically grasses and forbs, provides both shelter and food sources for the nymphs and adults. Its life cycle involves a gradual metamorphosis, with the nymphs molting several times before reaching adulthood. This variant is notable for its distinct coloration and habitat preferences, making it a subject of interest in ecological and entomological studies."
