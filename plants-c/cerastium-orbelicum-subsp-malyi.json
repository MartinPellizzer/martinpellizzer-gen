    "intro": "Cerastium orbelicum subsp. malyi, commonly known as the Malyi mouse-ear, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and its flowers are white or pale pink, borne in clusters at the ends of stems. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. It is adapted to cold climates and has a compact growth habit that helps it withstand harsh weather conditions. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution."
