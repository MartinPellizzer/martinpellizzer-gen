    "intro": "Ctenopteris hymenophylloides, commonly known as the Hymenophylloides fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a soft blue glow at night, which is a unique feature among ferns. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its botanical significance lies in its distinctive morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
