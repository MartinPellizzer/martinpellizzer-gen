    "intro": "Christella puberula, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots and rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and disturbed areas. The plant is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
