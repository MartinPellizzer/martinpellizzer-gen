    "intro": "Cirsium sorocephalum subsp. congestum, commonly known as the densehead thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and a dense, spherical head of purple to blue flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn, and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The species is often found in arid or semi-arid regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
