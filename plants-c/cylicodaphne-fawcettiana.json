    "intro": "Cylicodaphne fawcettiana, commonly known as the Fawcett's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery, compound leaves. Native to the Philippines, this species thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, typical of cycads. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
