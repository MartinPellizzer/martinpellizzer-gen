It features slender, twining stems that can reach lengths of up to 15 feet, making it an excellent choice for trellises or support structures. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to violet, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of compound leaves with narrow, elongated leaflets, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
