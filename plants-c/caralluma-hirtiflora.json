    "intro": "Caralluma hirtiflora, commonly known as the hairy nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapting well to harsh, drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pale green or yellow, which bloom at night, hence its common name. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Caralluma hirtiflora is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional medicine for various health purposes."
