It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of flowers. This variety is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in wetland or marshy habitats. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its botanical features make it adaptable to moist environments, contributing to its ecological significance in aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems."
