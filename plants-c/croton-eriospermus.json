    "intro": "Croton eriospermus, commonly known as the velvetleaf croton, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, spiny capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a garden plant, though it can be invasive in some regions."
