It features small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter, arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Cressa microphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
