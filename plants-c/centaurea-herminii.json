    "intro": "Centaurea herminii, commonly known as the slender centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its drought-resistant nature."
