    "intro": "Campanula lactiflora var. hirta, commonly known as the hairy bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and also bear a dense covering of hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
