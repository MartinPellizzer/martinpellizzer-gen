    "intro": "Chapelieria lemyrioides, commonly known as the golden spider orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to Southeast Asia. This perennial herbaceous plant features slender, erect stems that bear clusters of bright yellow, spider-like flowers. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
