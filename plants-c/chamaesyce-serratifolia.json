    "intro": "Chamaesyce serratifolia, commonly known as the serrated sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features hairy, succulent stems that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, serrated, and often covered in fine hairs, which contribute to its drought tolerance. Chamaesyce serratifolia is often found in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in full sun conditions."
