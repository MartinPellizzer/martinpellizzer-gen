    "intro": "Ceramocarpium umbrosum, commonly known as the shadow fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the shaded understories of tropical forests. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, glossy fronds that thrive in low-light conditions. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in compact clusters on the underside of its leaves. It requires high humidity and well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
