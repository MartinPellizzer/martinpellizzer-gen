    "intro": "Ctenitis zhejiangensis, commonly known as the Zhejiang huperzia, is a species of clubmoss native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in distinctive, cone-like formations at the tips of the leaves. Ctenitis zhejiangensis is valued for its ecological role in maintaining soil stability and its potential medicinal properties."
