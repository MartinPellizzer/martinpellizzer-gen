    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 savageanum, commonly known as the Savage's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is adapted for pollination by specific insects. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its leaves are broad and leathery, and it produces a single flower per stem, which blooms in late spring or early summer. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and threatened species in its native range."
