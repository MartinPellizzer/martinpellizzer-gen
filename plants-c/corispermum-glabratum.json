    "intro": "Corispermum glabratum, commonly known as the smooth corisperm, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Chenopodiaceae, which includes many salt-tolerant species. The plant is characterized by its small, green, fleshy leaves and produces tiny, pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through various physiological mechanisms, including succulence and reduced leaf surface area. Corispermum glabratum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
