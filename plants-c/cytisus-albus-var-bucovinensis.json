    "intro": "Cytisus albus var. bucovinensis, commonly known as the Bucovina whitethorn, is a shrub native to parts of Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant typically grows in sunny, well-drained soils. It is often found in woodland edges and rocky slopes, and it has a long flowering period that attracts pollinators. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and hardy nature in temperate climates."
