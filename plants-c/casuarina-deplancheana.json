It has needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, often found in dune environments. Casuarina deplancheana plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
