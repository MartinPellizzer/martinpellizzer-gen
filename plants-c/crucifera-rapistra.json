    "intro": "Crucifera rapistra, commonly known as wild mustard, is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. It typically grows in disturbed soils and is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant has alternate, pinnately lobed leaves and produces yellow or white flowers that attract pollinators. Its seeds are small and can be dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Wild mustard is also known for its peppery taste and has been used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop."
