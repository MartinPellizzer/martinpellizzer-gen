    "intro": "Cynanchum atrovirens, commonly known as black swallowwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and showy, milkweed-like flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans. It often grows in woodland edges and disturbed soils, and its rapid spread has led to its classification as an invasive species in some regions. The plant's unique morphology and ecological impact make it a notable subject in botanical studies."
