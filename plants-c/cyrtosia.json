    "intro": "Cyrtosia, commonly known as the false indigo or Cyrtosia tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It consists of several species, primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. Cyrtosia species often have a woody stem and produce pods that contain seeds. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
