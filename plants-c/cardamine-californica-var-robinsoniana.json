    "intro": "Cardamine californica var. robinsoniana, commonly known as Robinson's watercress, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. The species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
