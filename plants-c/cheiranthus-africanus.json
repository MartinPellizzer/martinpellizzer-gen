It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and produces yellow or white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while the fruit is a long, slender pod that splits open to release its seeds. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
