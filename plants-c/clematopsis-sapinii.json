    "intro": "Clematopsis sapinii, commonly known as the Alpine Clematopsis, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, adding a delicate touch to alpine meadows. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and high-altitude landscapes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural habitat."
