    "intro": "Cereus russellianus, commonly known as the Russell's candlestick cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a columnar cactus with a tall, slender stem that often branches near the top. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its spines are relatively short and sparse, giving it a distinctive, elegant appearance. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
