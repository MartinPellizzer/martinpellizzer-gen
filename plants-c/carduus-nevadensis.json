    "intro": "Carduus nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spiny, gray-green leaves and purple to pinkish purple composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It produces small, achene fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of concern in some regions."
