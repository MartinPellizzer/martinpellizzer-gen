    "intro": "Caladium sagittatum, commonly known as the arrowleaf caladium, is a tropical perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves that come in shades of green, red, and white. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is the main ornamental feature, making it a popular choice for garden displays. Caladium sagittatum is typically propagated through rhizomes and is often used in shaded or partially shaded garden beds."
