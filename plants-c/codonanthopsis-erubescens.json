    "intro": "Codonanthopsis erubescens, commonly known as the red-flowered codonanthus, is a species of flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces clusters of bright red or orange blooms during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate to bright light, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance make it a favored plant among horticulturists."
