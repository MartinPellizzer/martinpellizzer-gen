It features striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single, erect stem that bears the showy flowers. Its bulbs are toxic and contain colchicine, a compound used in medicine. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
