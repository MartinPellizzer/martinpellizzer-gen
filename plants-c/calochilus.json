    "intro": "Calochilus, commonly known as the star orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their distinctive, often star-shaped flowers. Calochilus species typically have long, slender petals and a unique, elongated lip that sets them apart from other orchids. They thrive in a variety of habitats, including rocky areas and heathlands, and are often found in coastal regions. Due to their striking appearance and specific growing requirements, many Calochilus species are cultivated by enthusiasts and botanists alike."
