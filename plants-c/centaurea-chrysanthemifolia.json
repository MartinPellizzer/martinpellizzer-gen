    "intro": "Centaurea chrysanthemifolia, commonly known as the golden centaury, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that resemble chrysanthemums, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, spiky seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. Centaurea chrysanthemifolia is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
