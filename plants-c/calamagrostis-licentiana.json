    "intro": "Calamagrostis licentiana, commonly known as the Licent's reed, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, riverbanks, and wet meadows. The plant features tall, slender culms that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are small, clustered flower structures. Calamagrostis licentiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting wetland biodiversity."
