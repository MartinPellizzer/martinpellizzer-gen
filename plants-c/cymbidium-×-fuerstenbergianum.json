    "intro": "Cymbidium \u00d7 fuerstenbergianum, commonly known as the Fuerstenberg orchid, is a hybrid orchid species that originated from crosses between Cymbidium goeringii and Cymbidium lowianum. It is a sympodial orchid with a rhizomatous growth habit, featuring pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with numerous showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. Its foliage consists of strap-like, dark green leaves that are broad and somewhat leathery. This species is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and as a potted plant."
