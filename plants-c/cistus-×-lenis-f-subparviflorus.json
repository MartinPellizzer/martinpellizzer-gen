    "intro": "Cistus \u00d7 lenis f. subparviflorus, commonly known as the dwarf flowering rockrose, is a hybrid shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has aromatic, glandular leaves that are often covered in a fine, woolly layer, typical of the Cistus genus. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for Mediterranean climates. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valued plant in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
