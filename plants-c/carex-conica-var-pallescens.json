    "intro": "Carex conica var. pallescens, commonly known as the pale-leaved tufted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, bogs, and along stream edges. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually pale green to bluish-gray in color. Its inflorescence consists of a single, upright spike of small, three-ranked flowers. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
