    "intro": "Cremanthodium microcephalum, commonly known as the small-headed cremanthodium, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and woolly, often hairy foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
