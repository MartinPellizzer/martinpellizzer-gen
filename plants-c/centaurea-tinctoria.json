    "intro": "Centaurea tinctoria, commonly known as the dyer's centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It produces bright yellow to red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It is often found in dry, sunny habitats like grasslands and rocky soils. Its historical significance lies in its use as a natural dye source, particularly for producing yellow and red hues in textiles."
