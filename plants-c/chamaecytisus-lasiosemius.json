It is characterized by its dense, wiry stems covered in a fine, woolly layer of hair. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. It is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
