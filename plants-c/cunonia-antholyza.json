    "intro": "Cunonia antholyza, commonly known as the yellow cunonia, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round, red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in coastal and garden settings due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Cunonia antholyza is also valued for its ability to attract birds and its role in stabilizing sandy soils."
