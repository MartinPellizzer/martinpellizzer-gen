It features slender, arching leaves that are typically a deep green, giving it a lush, tropical appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by dark blue berries, though it is primarily grown for its ornamental foliage rather than its flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate watering, making it a popular choice for indoor gardens. Its ability to tolerate low light conditions makes it an excellent houseplant for beginners."
