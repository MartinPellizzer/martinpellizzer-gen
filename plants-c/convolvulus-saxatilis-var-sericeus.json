    "intro": "Convolvulus saxatilis var. sericeus, commonly known as the silky rock bindweed, is a flowering plant native to rocky and coastal areas of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy, silver-green leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, pale purple or white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring and early summer. Its fibrous roots allow it to anchor securely in crevices, while its stems can twine around nearby vegetation. This variety is often found in dry, sunny environments and is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions."
