    "intro": "Croton echinatus, commonly known as the spiny croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often deeply lobed and have a distinctive, rugged texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, spiny capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
