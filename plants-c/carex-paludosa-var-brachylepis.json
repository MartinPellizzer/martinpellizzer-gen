    "intro": "Carex paludosa var. brachylepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 1 millimeter wide, giving it a distinct appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spikelets. This variety is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
