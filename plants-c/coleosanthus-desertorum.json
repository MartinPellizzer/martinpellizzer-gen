    "intro": "Coleosanthus desertorum, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with narrow, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss. Its yellow flowers bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Coleosanthus desertorum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and succulent leaves."
