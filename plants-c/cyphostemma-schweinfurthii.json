    "intro": "Cyphostemma schweinfurthii, commonly known as the desert date or African milk tree, is a shrub or small tree native to arid regions of Africa. It features thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible fruits resembling small dates. Its bark and leaves have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties. Cyphostemma schweinfurthii is adapted to survive in low-water conditions, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems."
