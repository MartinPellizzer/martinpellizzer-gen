    "intro": "Calycadenia truncata subsp. scabrella, commonly known as the roughleaf desert-honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and canyons. Its subspecies scabrella is distinguished by its rough, scabrous leaf surfaces and shorter, more compact growth form. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insects."
