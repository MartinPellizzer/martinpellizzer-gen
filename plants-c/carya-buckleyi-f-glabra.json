    "intro": "Carya buckleyi f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth hickory, is a variant of the hickory genus native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark, which distinguishes it from other hickory species. The plant produces edible nuts enclosed in a thick, woody husk, similar to other members of the Carya genus. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin. The smooth hickory is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
