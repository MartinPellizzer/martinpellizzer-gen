    "intro": "Campanula polymorpha subf. reflectans, commonly known as the reflexed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that face downward, a feature that gives it its common name. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. This plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
