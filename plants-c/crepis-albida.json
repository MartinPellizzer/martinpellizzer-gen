    "intro": "Crepis albida, commonly known as the white mouse-ear, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers and hairy, basal leaves that form a rosette. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands. Crepis albida is an annual or biennial herb that produces numerous small seeds enclosed in a pappus, aiding in wind dispersal. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitats."
