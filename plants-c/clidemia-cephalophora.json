    "intro": "Clidemia cephalophora, commonly known as the Hawaiian mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests, and has opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces. It plays an important role in the ecological systems of Hawaii, providing nectar for native pollinators. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
