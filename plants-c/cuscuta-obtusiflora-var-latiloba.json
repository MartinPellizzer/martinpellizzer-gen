    "intro": "Cuscuta obtusiflora var. latiloba, commonly known as the broad-leaved dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity. The plant has a weak, serpentine stem that wraps around host plants, forming a tight connection for nutrient uptake. It is commonly found in disturbed areas, such as fields and along roadsides, where it can infest a variety of herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken or even kill its host, making it a problematic weed in agricultural settings."
