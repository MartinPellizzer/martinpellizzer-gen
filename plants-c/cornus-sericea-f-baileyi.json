It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for wetland restoration and ecological landscaping."
