    "intro": "Crocus xanthosus, commonly known as the yellow crocus, is a species of flowering plant in the Iridaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, where it thrives in rocky soils and open habitats. The plant produces showy, bright yellow flowers with six petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its corms are underground storage organs that allow it to survive harsh winter conditions. The yellow crocus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
