    "intro": "Cuscuta major var. nefrens, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host to extract water and nutrients. The plant is native to North America and often infests crops and wild plants, causing significant damage. Its life cycle involves germinating on host seeds and developing specialized structures called haustoria to attach to the host. Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
