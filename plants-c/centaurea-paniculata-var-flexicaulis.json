It is characterized by its tall, branching stems and pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves with a woolly texture, and it produces fluffy, feathery seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry grasslands and rocky areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
