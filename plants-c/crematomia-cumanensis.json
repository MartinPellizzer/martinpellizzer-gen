    "intro": "Crematomia cumanensis, commonly known as the Cumanensis Crematomia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, velvety foliage and showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its botanical features include hairy stems and leaves with a waxy surface, which help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
