    "intro": "Chamaesaracha villosa, commonly known as the hairy chamaesaracha, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features wiry, branching stems covered in fine, hairy textures, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in a similar hairy coating. Chamaesaracha villosa is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a resilient component of Mediterranean flora."
