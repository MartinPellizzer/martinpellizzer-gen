    "intro": "Cotinus coggygria var. purpureus, commonly known as the European smoke bush, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery panicles that produce a profuse display of pale pink to white flowers in late summer. The plant's leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a velvety texture and a deep purple to red hue in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. The European smoke bush is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
