It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Carex prolifera produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often wind-pollinated. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
