    "intro": "Cuviera wernhamii, commonly known as the Wernham's cuviera, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions in South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and requires well-drained soil to thrive. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cuviera wernhamii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
