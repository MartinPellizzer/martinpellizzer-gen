    "intro": "Cordyline fruticosa var. ferrea, commonly known as the red cordyline, is a striking evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and its distinctive, lance-shaped leaves that are bright red to orange in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
