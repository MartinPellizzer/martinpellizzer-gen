    "intro": "Catasetum \u00d7 pohlianum, commonly known as the Orchid of the Gods, is a hybrid orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can range in color from yellow to orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. It produces a unique structure called a gynostemium, which is a fused column of reproductive organs. Catasetum \u00d7 pohlianum requires specific care, including high humidity and bright, indirect light, to thrive."
