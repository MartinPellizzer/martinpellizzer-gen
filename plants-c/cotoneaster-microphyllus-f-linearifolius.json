    "intro": "Cotoneaster microphyllus f. linearifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cotoneaster, is a compact, deciduous shrub characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. It produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. Native to the mountainous regions of western China, this plant thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness. The foliage remains dense throughout the growing season, making it a desirable plant for erosion control and landscape design."
