    "intro": "Cyclachaena xanthiifolia var. minor, commonly known as the lesser yellow-leaved cyclachaena, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically yellowish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the late summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
