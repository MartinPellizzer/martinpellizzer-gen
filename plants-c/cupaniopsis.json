    "intro": "Cupaniopsis, commonly known as the ghost gum or cupaniopsis acuata, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its unique, waxy, and often pale green or white foliage. The leaves are typically alternate, simple, and have a distinctive, almost translucent appearance. Cupaniopsis species are often found in arid or semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by fruiting structures known as cupules, which give the plant its genus name."
