    "intro": "Cynara hystrix, commonly known as the Spanish artichoke, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its prickly leaves and purple-tinged flower heads. The plant produces edible buds that are harvested before they fully open, similar to the common artichoke. Its leaves are covered in dense, spiny hairs that provide protection from herbivores. Cynara hystrix thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
