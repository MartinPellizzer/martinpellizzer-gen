    "intro": "Corispermum squarrosum subsp. silvicola, commonly known as the forest corispermum, is a low-growing annual plant native to temperate regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers and bract-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. The subspecies silvicola is distinguished by its more compact growth form compared to other subspecies of Corispermum."
