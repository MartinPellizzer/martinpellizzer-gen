It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that range from red to purple. The plant features hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
