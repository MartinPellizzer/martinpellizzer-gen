    "intro": "Cordia diversa, commonly known as the red mangrove or red mangrove tree, is a tropical plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its thick, flaky bark and dark green, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or red in color, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. It thrives in brackish or saline water, making it an important species in mangrove ecosystems. Its root system helps stabilize coastal soils and provides habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
