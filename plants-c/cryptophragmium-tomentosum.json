    "intro": "Cryptophragmium tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly cryptophragmium, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of minute, glandular hairs, which give it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its leaves are usually small, ovate, and arranged in a rosette pattern, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. Cryptophragmium tomentosum is a cryptophytes, meaning it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead has structures called thallus that absorb nutrients directly from the environment."
