It is characterized by its large, leathery, elliptical fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
