    "intro": "Carex cardiolepis, commonly known as the heart-leaved sedge, is a flowering plant species belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it a common sight in wetlands and forest understories. The plant's name refers to the heart-shaped appearance of its leaves, which is a distinctive botanical characteristic."
