    "intro": "Codiaeum deplanchei, commonly known as the velvetleaf croton, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The leaves display a wide range of colors, including shades of red, orange, yellow, and green, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This plant is relatively easy to care for, making it accessible for both novice and experienced gardeners."
