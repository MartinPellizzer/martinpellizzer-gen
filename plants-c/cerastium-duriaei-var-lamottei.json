    "intro": "Cerastium duriaei var. lamottei, commonly known as the Lamotte's mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized flora species."
