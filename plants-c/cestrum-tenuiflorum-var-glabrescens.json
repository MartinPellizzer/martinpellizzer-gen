It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but often have a mild, sour taste. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often cultivated for its nocturnal fragrance and ornamental value. This variety is generally resistant to pests and diseases, making it a low-maintenance addition to gardens."
