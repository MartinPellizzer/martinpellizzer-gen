It features heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed and have a waxy, slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its stems are succulent and can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread easily. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage."
