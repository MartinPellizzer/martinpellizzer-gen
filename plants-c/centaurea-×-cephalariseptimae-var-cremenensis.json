    "intro": "Centaurea \u00d7 cephalariseptimae var. cremenensis, commonly known as the Cretan star-thistle, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the island of Crete. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and spiny bracts. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to Mediterranean climates. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves with a hairy texture, and it produces small, seed-like fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to its ornamental value and ecological resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
