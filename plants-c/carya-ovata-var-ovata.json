    "intro": "Carya ovata var. ovata, commonly known as the black walnut, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its doubly serrated leaves and distinctive, spiny husks that encase its edible, oily kernels. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are pollinated by wind. Its wood is highly valued for its strength and resistance to decay, making it a prized material in woodworking. The plant also plays an important ecological role, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
