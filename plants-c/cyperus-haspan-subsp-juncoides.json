    "intro": "Cyperus haspan subsp. juncoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and seasonally flooded areas, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often inconspicuous. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems, impacting native plant communities."
