    "intro": "Cyclophyllum protractum, commonly known as the elongated cyclophyllum, is a unique member of the Cyclophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiraling growth pattern and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Its fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that contains several seeds. Cyclophyllum protractum is native to certain regions of Africa and is adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
