    "intro": "Canna aurantiaca splendida, commonly known as the red flame cannas, is a striking ornamental plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy bracts that range from bright red to orange in color, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in clusters at the base of the plant. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining, fertile soil. Canna aurantiaca splendida is often cultivated for its vibrant foliage and is a popular choice in gardens and landscapes."
