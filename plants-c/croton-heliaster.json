    "intro": "Croton heliaster, commonly known as the sunflower croton, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often bright green with a reddish or bronze underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, spiny fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its unique appearance, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic value rather than for its edible properties."
