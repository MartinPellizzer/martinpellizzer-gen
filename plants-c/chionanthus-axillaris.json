    "intro": "Chionanthus axillaris, commonly known as the silverleaf viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers in clustered inflorescences during the spring. These flowers are followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
