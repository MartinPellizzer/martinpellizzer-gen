It is characterized by its simple, oval-shaped leaves and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus ovata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
