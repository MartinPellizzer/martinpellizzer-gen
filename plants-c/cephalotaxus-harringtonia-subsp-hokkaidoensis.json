    "intro": "Cephalotaxus harringtonia subsp. hokkaidoensis, commonly known as the Hokkaido yew, is a rare evergreen conifer native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and dense, scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
