    "intro": "Corallorrhiza, commonly known as the coral root, is an epiphytic orchid that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, forming a mycorrhizal relationship to absorb water and minerals. The plant has a delicate, root-like structure that intertwines with the roots of its host, often without causing harm. It is found in tropical and subtropical regions, typically growing on trees or shrubs. Its unique appearance, with small, white or pale pink flowers, makes it a striking yet elusive member of the orchid family."
