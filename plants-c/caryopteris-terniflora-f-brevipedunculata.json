It features small, sky-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, creating a dense, mist-like appearance. The plant has narrow, silver-gray leaves that are aromatic when crushed, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a low-maintenance choice for gardeners."
