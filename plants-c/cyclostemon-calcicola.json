    "intro": "Cyclostemon calcicola, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, small evergreen leaves, and clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to hot, dry environments. Its botanical features include a woody stem and opposite leaf arrangement, which help it conserve water. Cyclostemon calcicola is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
