It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and roadsides, and it can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a single head. Cnicus linearis is often used in traditional medicine and is also a host plant for certain butterfly species."
