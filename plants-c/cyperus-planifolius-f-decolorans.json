It is a perennial herb characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that exhibit a distinctive variegation pattern, often with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it both an ornamental plant and an indicator species for wetland habitats."
