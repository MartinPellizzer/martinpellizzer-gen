    "intro": "Crataegus insueta, commonly known as the smooth hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thornless stems, which distinguish it from other hawthorn species. The plant produces white to pink flowers in spring, followed by red, juicy berries in the fall. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges, and it typically grows in moist woodland areas. Crataegus insueta is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local wildlife."
