    "intro": "Cordia longipedunculata, commonly known as the long peduncle cordia, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in clusters along long, branching inflorescences. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually ovate to elliptical in shape. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds. Cordia longipedunculata is often found in moist, well-drained soils in lowland tropical regions."
