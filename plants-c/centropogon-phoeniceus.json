    "intro": "Centropogon phoeniceus, commonly known as the red bottlebrush, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its striking red or orange cylindrical flower clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure. Centropogon phoeniceus is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
