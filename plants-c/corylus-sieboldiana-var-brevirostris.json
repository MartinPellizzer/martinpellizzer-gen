It produces small, edible nuts enclosed in a prickly husk, which mature in the fall. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves with a serrated margin and a hairy underside. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and winter interest."
