    "intro": "Chionochloa rigida subsp. amara, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Southern Hemisphere, particularly found in New Zealand. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in alpine and subalpine regions where temperatures are cool and conditions are harsh. The plant is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems and fine, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, windy conditions. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine invertebrates. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some areas."
