    "intro": "Ctenitis fraterna, commonly known as the fraternally fronded fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are divided into numerous small, finger-like segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces new growth from its nodes. Ctenitis fraterna is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
