    "intro": "Cystopteris jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant in the substrate while its fronds float on the water's surface. The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family."
