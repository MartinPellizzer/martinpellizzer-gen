    "intro": "Carapa obovata var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its ovate, glossy leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The tree produces woody capsules that contain numerous flat, kidney-shaped seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a significant resource in the timber industry. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
