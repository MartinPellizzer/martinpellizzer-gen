    "intro": "Coleus edulis, commonly known as the edible coleus, is a herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful leaves that range from green to red, purple, and maroon. The plant belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is closely related to other aromatic herbs like basil and oregano. Its leaves are often used in traditional cuisines for their mild, slightly peppery flavor. However, it is important to note that only the leaves are edible, and the rest of the plant contains toxic compounds."
