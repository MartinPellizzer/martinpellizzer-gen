    "intro": "Cotylephora altissima, commonly known as the giant sea anemone, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the family Actiniidae. It is characterized by its large, soft body and long, slender tentacles that surround a central mouth. This species thrives in shallow coastal waters, often attached to rocks or coral structures. Its vibrant colors and unique morphology make it a notable presence in tropical and subtropical marine ecosystems. Cotylephora altissima plays a role in the food web by both preying on small organisms and serving as prey for larger marine animals."
