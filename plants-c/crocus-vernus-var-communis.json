    "intro": "Crocus vernus var. communis, commonly known as the common crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of white, pale yellow, and pink, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous underground stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, contributing to early-season nectar availability."
