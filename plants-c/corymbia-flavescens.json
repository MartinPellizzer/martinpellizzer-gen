    "intro": "Corymbia flavescens, commonly known as the yellow bloodwood, is a species of eucalyptus native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that ranges from grey to reddish-brown in color. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, which are visited by various pollinators. Its timber is hard and durable, historically valued for its use in tool handles and other crafts. The plant plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
