    "intro": "Carpinus likiangensis, commonly known as the Yunnan hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to China. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. It typically grows in mountainous regions at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
