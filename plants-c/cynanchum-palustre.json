    "intro": "Cynanchum palustre, commonly known as swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish tinge. The plant produces clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a hairy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to waterlogged soils. Cynanchum palustre plays an important ecological role in supporting biodiversity in moist environments."
