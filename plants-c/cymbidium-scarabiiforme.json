    "intro": "Cymbidium scarabiiforme, commonly known as the scarab beetle orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender pseudobulbs and striking, dark green leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing numerous fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, elongated shape. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
