    "intro": "Carex godfreyi, commonly known as Godfrey's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Carex godfreyi is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse ecosystems."
