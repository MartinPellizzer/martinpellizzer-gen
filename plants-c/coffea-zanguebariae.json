    "intro": "Coffea zanguebariae, commonly known as the Pemba coffee, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Pemba in the Zanzibar archipelago. It is a small evergreen shrub that produces red, fleshy berries containing its seeds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil, typical of its coastal forest habitat. Its leaves are glossy and elliptical, while its flowers are small and white, often clustered in groups. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Coffea zanguebariae is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
