    "intro": "Calanthe stella, commonly known as the star calanthe, is a rare and elegant orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with partial shade, making it a challenging but rewarding species for orchid enthusiasts. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, Calanthe stella is often cultivated in controlled conditions to ensure its survival."
