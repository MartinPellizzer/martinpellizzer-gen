    "intro": "Carex bigelowii subsp. arctisibirica, commonly known as the Arctic sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. It has narrow, linear leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. This subspecies is an important component of the vegetation in its native ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various arctic wildlife species."
