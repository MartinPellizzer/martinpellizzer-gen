    "intro": "Centranthus calcitrapae f. puberulus, commonly known as the pubescent centranthus, is a rare and lesser-known botanical variant of the Centranthus genus. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage, which distinguishes it from the typical smooth-leaved forms of the species. This plant thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and it blooms in the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and ecologically significant species."
