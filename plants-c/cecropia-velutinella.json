    "intro": "Cecropia velutinella, commonly known as the velvet ceiba, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, three-lobed capsules containing numerous seeds. Its root system is extensive and often forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. This species is valued for its ecological role in providing habitat and food for various animals in its native ecosystems."
