    "intro": "Cheilanthes parryi, commonly known as the Parry's rockcap, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and dark green, leathery fronds. Native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America, it thrives in rocky and crevice habitats. The plant is drought-tolerant and has adapted to survive in low-nutrient environments. Its spore-producing structures are typically found on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
