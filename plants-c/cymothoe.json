    "intro": "Cymothoe, commonly known as the swallowtail butterfly, is a genus of butterflies in the family Nymphalidae. These butterflies are characterized by their distinctive wing patterns, which often include bold, contrasting colors and intricate designs. The larvae of Cymothoe species typically feed on plants in the legume family, such as those in the genus *Pterocarpus*. The plants host to these caterpillars play a crucial role in the life cycle and population dynamics of the genus. Botanically, the study of these plants helps in understanding the ecological relationships and conservation needs of Cymothoe butterflies."
