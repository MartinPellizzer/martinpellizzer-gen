    "intro": "Cicerbita tenerrima, commonly known as the bitter caper or wild caper, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a sprawling growth habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often lobed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, warty, greenish-brown fruits. Its leaves and young shoots are edible but have a sharp, bitter taste, making them suitable for culinary use in moderation. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry habitats."
