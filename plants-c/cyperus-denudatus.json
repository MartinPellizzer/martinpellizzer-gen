It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairless. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically found in clusters at the ends of the stems. Cyperus denudatus is often found in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small aquatic organisms."
