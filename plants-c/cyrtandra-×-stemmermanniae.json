    "intro": "Cyrtandra \u00d7 stemmermanniae, commonly known as the hybrid Cyrtandra, is a flowering plant in the Gesneriaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Cyrtandra cariosperma and Cyrtandra fruticosa, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species. The plant typically exhibits a shrub-like growth habit with lanceolate leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. It is native to Hawaii and is adapted to the island's tropical climate, often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
