It is a herbaceous annual with slender, twining stems that climb by means of tendrils. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming from spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and alternate, often with a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common weed in disturbed areas."
