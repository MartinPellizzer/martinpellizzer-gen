    "intro": "Centaurea \u00d7 doumerguei, commonly known as the hybrid cornflower, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Centaurea cyanus (blue cornflower) and Centaurea stoebe (knobbed cornflower), resulting in a plant with distinctive blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and showy composite flowers that attract pollinators. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, thriving in temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but can also become invasive in certain regions."
