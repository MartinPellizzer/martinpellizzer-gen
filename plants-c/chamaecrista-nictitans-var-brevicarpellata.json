    "intro": "Chamaecrista nictitans var. brevicarpellata, commonly known as the small-sepaled coralbean, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive, showy yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Botanically, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
