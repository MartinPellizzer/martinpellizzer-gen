It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills. Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
