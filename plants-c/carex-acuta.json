    "intro": "Carex acuta, commonly known as sharpleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it produces distinctive, three-angled seeds. Carex acuta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
