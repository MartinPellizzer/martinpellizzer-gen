    "intro": "Chaenactis nevadensis var. mainsiana, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada's ghostflower, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a small, herbaceous plant with a rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves that help it conserve moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, dandelion-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
