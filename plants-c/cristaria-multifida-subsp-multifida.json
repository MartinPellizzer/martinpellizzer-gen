    "intro": "Cristaria multifida subsp. multifida, commonly known as the multifid leaf fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, finely divided, feathery fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or near streams. Its leaves are delicate and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, with a graceful, arching appearance. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid environments."
