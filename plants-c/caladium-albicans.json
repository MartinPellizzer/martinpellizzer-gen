    "intro": "Caladium albicans, commonly known as the white-veined caladium, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with bright white veins against a deep green background. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Caladium albicans is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and indoor spaces. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are not typically visible above the foliage."
