    "intro": "Crotalaria obtecta var. glabrescens, commonly known as the silky cowpea, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces that become smoother as the plant matures. The flowers are typically yellow with a distinctive black spot at the base, and they are borne in clusters. The plant produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds, which are used as a legume crop in some regions. It is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often used for forage or soil improvement due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
