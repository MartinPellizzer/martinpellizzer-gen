    "intro": "Cissus laciniata, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a trailing evergreen vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by spherical, red berries, which are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often used as a ground cover or hanging plant due to its rapid growth and ability to climb. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
