    "intro": "Charieis heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, variable leaf morphology, which can range from lanceolate to ovate in shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. The spores are released from sori that are arranged along the margins of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
