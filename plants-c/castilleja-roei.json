    "intro": "Castilleja roei, commonly known as the Sierra redshank, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in open coniferous forests and meadows, often forming dense colonies. Its roots penetrate the roots of neighboring plants, drawing nutrients and water from them. Castilleja roei plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
