    "intro": "Calanthe polyantha, commonly known as the Chinese everlasting orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Calanthe polyantha prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable conditions."
