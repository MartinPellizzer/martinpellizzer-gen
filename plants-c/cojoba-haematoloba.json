    "intro": "Cojoba haematoloba, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and beauty. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Due to overharvesting, Cojoba haematoloba is now listed as an endangered species in many regions."
