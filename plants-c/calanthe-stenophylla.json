    "intro": "Calanthe stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf calanthe, is a herbaceous perennial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with upright, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces striking, spurred orchid flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, often arranged in a raceme. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Calanthe stenophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
