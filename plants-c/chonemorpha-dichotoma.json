    "intro": "Chonemorpha dichotoma, commonly known as the tree of heaven, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South Africa. It is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to different environmental conditions. The plant's rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive."
