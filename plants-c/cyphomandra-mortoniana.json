    "intro": "Cyphomandra mortoniana, commonly known as the Morton's nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the Solanaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It is known for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities. However, like many members of the nightshade family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
