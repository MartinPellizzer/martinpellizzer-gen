    "intro": "Cyathea salticola, commonly known as the jumping fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant exhibits a unique growth habit, with its fronds curling and uncurling in response to changes in light and humidity. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in moist, shaded environments. Cyathea salticola is often found in rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in humid ecosystems."
