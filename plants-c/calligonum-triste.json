    "intro": "Calligonum triste, commonly known as the bitter saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of salt crystals, which help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its woody stems are often covered in a thick, waxy cuticle that reduces water loss. Calligonum triste is well adapted to saline soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
