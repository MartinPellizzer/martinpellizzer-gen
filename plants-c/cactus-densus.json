    "intro": "Cactus densus, commonly known as the dense cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant typically grows in a compact, rounded shape with spines that protect it from herbivores. Its flowers, which appear in spring, are often bright yellow or orange and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
