    "intro": "Cardamine angustata, commonly known as narrowleaf watercress, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters and features trifoliate leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in wet soils, often found near streams, marshes, and woodland edges. The species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
