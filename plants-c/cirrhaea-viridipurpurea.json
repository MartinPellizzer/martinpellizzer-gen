    "intro": "Cirrhaea viridipurpurea, commonly known as the purple-green cirrhaea, is a rare flowering plant characterized by its unique combination of green and purple hues in its foliage. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale green to white, adding a subtle contrast to its vibrant leaves. Its leaves are elongated and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in humid conditions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Cirrhaea viridipurpurea is considered a sensitive indicator of ecological health in its native regions."
