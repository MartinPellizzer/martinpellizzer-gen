    "intro": "Copernicia alba, commonly known as the white copernicia, is a species of palm native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, white, fleshy fruits that are a food source for various animals. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts, and the plant is adapted to grow in coastal and sandy soils. Copernicia alba plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, supporting biodiversity and contributing to local ecosystems."
