    "intro": "Critoniopsis baadii, commonly known as the Baadi's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, translucent leaves and delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its small size and cryptic appearance make it difficult to detect in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Critoniopsis baadii is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
