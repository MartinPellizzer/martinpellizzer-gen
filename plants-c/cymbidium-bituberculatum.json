It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers have a distinctive zigzag pattern on the petals, which gives it its common name. Cymbidium bituberculatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
