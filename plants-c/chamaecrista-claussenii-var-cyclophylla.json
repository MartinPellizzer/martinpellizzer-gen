    "intro": "Chamaecrista claussenii var. cyclophylla, commonly known as the cyclophylla burr legume, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive, clustered, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
