    "intro": "Cerastium boreale var. scariosum, commonly known as the Arctic mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers in early summer, which are typically arranged in umbels. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in colder climates."
