    "intro": "Caladium connaertii, commonly known as the pink-veined caladium, is a tropical perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with intricate pink and white veins. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is the primary ornamental feature, making it a popular choice for shade gardens and container planting. Caladium connaertii is typically grown as an annual in temperate climates due to its sensitivity to cold temperatures."
