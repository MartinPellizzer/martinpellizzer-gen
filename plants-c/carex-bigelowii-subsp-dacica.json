    "intro": "Carex bigelowii subsp. dacica, commonly known as Bigelow's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, bogs, and along stream banks. The plant features grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and narrow, with a dense cluster of small, spike-like flowers in the summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which helps stabilize soil in wetland environments. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
