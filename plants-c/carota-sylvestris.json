    "intro": "Carota sylvestris, commonly known as wild carrot, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other aromatic herbs like parsley and dill. The plant features a taproot that is typically white or yellowish in color, with finely divided, feather-like leaves. Its flowers are small and white, forming an umbrella-shaped inflorescence known as a umbel. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can be mistaken for poison hemlock due to its similar appearance."
