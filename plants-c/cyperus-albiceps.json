    "intro": "Cyperus albiceps, commonly known as the white-headed flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, with the inflorescence often appearing white or pale due to the presence of white bracts. Cyperus albiceps is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
