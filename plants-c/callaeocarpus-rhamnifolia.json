    "intro": "Callaeocarpus rhamnifolia, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a distinctive plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, tree-like structure with a thick, fibrous trunk. The plant has large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in spore-bearing cones at the tips of the fronds. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments and plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
