    "intro": "Cardamine opizii, commonly known as the Opiz's watercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It is a small herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves and small white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous, and it produces small, elongated fruits containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
