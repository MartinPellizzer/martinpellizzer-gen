It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
