    "intro": "Cestrum gardneri, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshade plants, and is characterized by its showy, white, star-shaped flowers that open at night. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with smooth, often thornless stems and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. Its flowers emit a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths. Cestrum gardneri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and unique blooming habit."
