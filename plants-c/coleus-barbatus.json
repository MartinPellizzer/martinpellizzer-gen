    "intro": "Coleus barbatus, commonly known as the flame wheel plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, colorful, and often variegated foliage, which can range from red, orange, and yellow to green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale purple, which are not the main ornamental feature. It thrives in warm, humid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Coleus barbatus is widely cultivated as a decorative plant for its vibrant leaves and is often used in gardens and as a houseplant."
