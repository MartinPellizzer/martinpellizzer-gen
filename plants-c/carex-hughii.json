    "intro": "Carex hughii, commonly known as the Hugh's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to the western United States, particularly found in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and woodland areas. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets arranged along its flowering stems. It is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in wet conditions. Carex hughii is relatively low-maintenance, requiring minimal fertilizer and regular watering to maintain its health."
