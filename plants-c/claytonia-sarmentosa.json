    "intro": "Claytonia sarmentosa, commonly known as the trailing spring beauty, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features fleshy, succulent leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, and it produces small, showy white or pink flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and streambanks. Its stems are prostrate and can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Claytonia sarmentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
