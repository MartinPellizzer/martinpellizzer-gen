    "intro": "Cerastium holosteoides subsp. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The subspecies glabrescens is distinguished by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves, which are typically covered in a waxy cuticle. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dunes. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations."
