    "intro": "Conobea viscosa, commonly known as the sticky conobea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, sticky substance. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Conobea viscosa is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Apocynaceae family."
