    "intro": "Cerastium malyi subsp. serpentini, commonly known as the serpent's tail chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Its common name reflects the twisted, serpentine appearance of its flowering stems."
