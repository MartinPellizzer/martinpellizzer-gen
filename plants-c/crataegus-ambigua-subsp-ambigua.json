    "intro": "Crataegus ambigua subsp. ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually pubescent beneath. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in corymbs, followed by red or orange berries that are edible for birds and small mammals. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. The subspecies is distinguished by its morphological variability, which contributes to its common name."
