    "intro": "Chlorophytum senegalense, commonly known as the African snake plant, is a perennial herb native to West Africa. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish or purple tint. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, which are followed by cylindrical seed pods. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It is well adapted to arid environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and air-purifying properties."
