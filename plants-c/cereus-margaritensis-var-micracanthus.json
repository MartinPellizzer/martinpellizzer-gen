    "intro": "Cereus margaritensis var. micracanthus, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a hybrid cactus species originating from the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its vivid, showy flowers that bloom at night, typically in shades of white, pink, or red. The plant has a short, thick stem with a dense covering of spines, and its roots are adapted to absorb moisture efficiently. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
