    "intro": "Corniola tinctoria var. plena, commonly known as the full-flowered corniola, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking vibrant, drought-tolerant plants. The varietal name \"plena\" refers to its fully double flowers, which are more elaborate than those of the typical variety."
