    "intro": "Convolvulus valentinus var. transiens, commonly known as the transient heartleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant is native to southern Africa and thrives in warm, sunny climates. It is a climbing vine that produces small, edible fruits, though the flowers are the most notable feature. Due to its fleeting bloom period, it is often referred to as the \"transient\" variety."
