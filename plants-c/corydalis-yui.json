    "intro": "Corydalis yui, commonly known as the Yui larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to violet. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters and produces small, elliptical leaves with a hairy texture. Corydalis yui is often found in rocky or woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
