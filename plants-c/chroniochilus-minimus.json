    "intro": "Chroniochilus minimus, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, slender leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. It is well adapted to low light conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
