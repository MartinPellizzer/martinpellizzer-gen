    "intro": "Clintonia triflora, commonly known as the white fringeflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has strap-like, basal leaves that remain throughout the growing season. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully expand, and are pollinated by insects. Clintonia triflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
