    "intro": "Cystium tehatchapiense, commonly known as the Tehatchapi thornbush, is a shrub native to the Tehachapi Mountains in California. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically red or purple in color. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
