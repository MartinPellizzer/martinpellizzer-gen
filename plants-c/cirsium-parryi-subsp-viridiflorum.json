    "intro": "Cirsium parryi subsp. viridiflorum, commonly known as the green-flowered thistle, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as mountain slopes and grasslands. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough, hairy texture, and its stems are usually erect and branched. The subspecies is distinguished by its greenish-yellow flowers, which are less intensely colored than those of other Cirsium species."
