    "intro": "Chionochloa oreophila var. oreophila, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Southern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that are adapted to cold, alpine environments. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, such as mountains and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh, high-altitude habitats."
