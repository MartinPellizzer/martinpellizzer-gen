    "intro": "Cormonema, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows from a corm-like structure, which serves as a storage organ for nutrients. Its leaves are thick and waxy, helping to retain moisture in arid environments. Cormonema is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
