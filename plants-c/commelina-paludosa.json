    "intro": "Commelina paludosa, commonly known as marsh spiderwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland areas of the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, blue-violet flowers with three petals and three sepals, typically blooming from spring to early summer. Its root system consists of fibrous roots that help stabilize the soil in moist environments. Commelina paludosa is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and ditches."
