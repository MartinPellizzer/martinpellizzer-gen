    "intro": "Ctenopteris ledermannii, commonly known as the Ledermann's sea palm, is a rare species of fern native to the coastal regions of southern Florida and the Bahamas. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are often submerged or partially submerged in marine environments. The plant thrives in shallow, brackish water, where it forms dense underwater colonies. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its unique reproductive strategy. This species plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediment and providing habitat for marine organisms."
