It is characterized by its large, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a distinctive yellow throat. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive dry periods. This variety is highly prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and unique floral characteristics."
