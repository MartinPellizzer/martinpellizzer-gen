    "intro": "Coelodiscus ustulatus, commonly known as the flame flower, is a striking plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its vibrant orange-red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is known for its unique, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. Its botanical features include opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and a strong, aromatic scent. Coelodiscus ustulatus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
