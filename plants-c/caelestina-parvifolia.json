    "intro": "Caelestina parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved skyflower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle yet striking visual appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden spaces. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
