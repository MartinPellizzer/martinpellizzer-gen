    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris oelandica, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb with a prostrate or ascending habit. It features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, triangular fruits called silicles, which contain several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in many temperate regions."
