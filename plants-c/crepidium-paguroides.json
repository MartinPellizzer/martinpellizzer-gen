    "intro": "Crepidium paguroides, commonly known as the Pagoda orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a striking inflorescence of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or forested slopes. Its flowers are clustered in a raceme, giving it a pagoda-like appearance, hence its common name. The species is noted for its delicate structure and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens."
