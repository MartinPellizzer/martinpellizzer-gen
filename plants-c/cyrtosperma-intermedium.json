    "intro": "Cyrtosperma intermedium, commonly known as the Malabar arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Its inflorescence consists of small, clustered flowers that are usually green or yellowish in color. The plant is valued for its starchy roots, which are used in traditional cuisines and as a source of starch."
