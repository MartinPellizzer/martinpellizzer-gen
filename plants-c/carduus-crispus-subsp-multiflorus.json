    "intro": "Carduus crispus subsp. multiflorus, commonly known as the curly thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust, spiny stem and a rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces a dense cluster of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically edible when young, though they become more bitter and fibrous with age. The species is adapted to grow in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas."
