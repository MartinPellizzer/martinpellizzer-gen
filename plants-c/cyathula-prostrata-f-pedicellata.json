    "intro": "Cyathula prostrata f. pedicellata, commonly known as the creeping cyathula, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a prostrate growth habit with slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in cyathia, which are cup-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. This variant is distinguished by its pedicellate (stalked) flowers, which set it apart from the typical form of Cyathula prostrata."
