    "intro": "Cardamine schinziana var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the velvetleaf watercress, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive velvety texture. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, erect stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, often forming dense patches in moist, shaded environments. The species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to that of watercress."
