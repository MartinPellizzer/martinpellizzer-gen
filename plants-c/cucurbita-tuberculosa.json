It is native to the Americas and is characterized by its hairy, spiny stems and large, lobed leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that give way to elongated, cylindrical fruits with a rough, spiny surface. Its fruit is edible when mature, though it is often used as a vegetable in various cuisines. The plant thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
