    "intro": "Capparis linearis, commonly known as the narrowleaf caper, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy habitats, often found in the Western and Northern Cape provinces. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red or orange berries. Its leaves are narrow and linear, giving it its common name, and it has a distinctive, somewhat prickly appearance. Capparis linearis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
