    "intro": "Cheirostylis nantouensis, commonly known as the Nantou orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to Taiwan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it receives indirect sunlight. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
