    "intro": "Carex depressa f. tenella, commonly known as the compact sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly curled at the tips. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by bracts. This form is notable for its compact growth and is often used in ornamental gardening for its dense, mat-forming habit."
