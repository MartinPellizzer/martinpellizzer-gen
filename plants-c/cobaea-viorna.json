    "intro": "Cobaea viorna, commonly known as the sweet potato vine, is a tropical perennial plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves that range in color from deep green to purple. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage rather than its edible roots. Cobaea viorna is a popular choice for gardeners seeking to add visual interest to shaded or partially sunny areas."
