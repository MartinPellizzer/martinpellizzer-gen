    "intro": "Clermontia grandiflora var. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf clermontia, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in montane rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
