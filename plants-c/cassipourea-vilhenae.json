    "intro": "Cassipourea vilhenae, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a glossy surface. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by small, round berries. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
