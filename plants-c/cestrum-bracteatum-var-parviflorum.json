    "intro": "Cestrum bracteatum var. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, shiny seeds. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
