    "intro": "Chelonistele keithiana, commonly known as the Keith's chelonistele, is a rare and unique member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like foliage and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in umbels. Native to the high-altitude regions of New Zealand, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments. Its growth habit is typically low and clump-forming, with a delicate appearance that reflects its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
