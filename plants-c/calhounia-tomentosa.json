    "intro": "Calhounia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly calhounia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its hairy, grayish foliage and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its flowers bloom in the spring and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Calhounia tomentosa is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability to aquatic environments."
