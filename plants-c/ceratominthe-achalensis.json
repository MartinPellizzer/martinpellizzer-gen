    "intro": "Ceratominthe achalensis, commonly known as the Achalensis horned orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of India. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, horn-like structures on its flowers, which are believed to play a role in pollination. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and high humidity. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
