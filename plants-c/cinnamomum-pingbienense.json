    "intro": "Cinnamomum pingbienense, commonly known as the Pingbian cinnamon, is a rare evergreen tree native to China, specifically the Yunnan Province. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and bark, which contain essential oils. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high elevations. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a glossy surface, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by dark purple berries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
