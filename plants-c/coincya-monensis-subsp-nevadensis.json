    "intro": "Coincya monensis subsp. nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. The plant has a rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that help it float and absorb sunlight. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its botanical features make it well adapted to its aquatic habitat, though it is considered rare and endangered in its native range."
