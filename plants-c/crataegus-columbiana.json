    "intro": "Crataegus columbiana, commonly known as the Pacific crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white to pink flowers in early spring. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are often consumed by birds and small mammals. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. The Pacific crabapple is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks."
