    "intro": "Carex stenophylla var. eleocharis, commonly known as slender spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale to brownish flowers. This variety is typically found in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows. The plant has a fibrous root system and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. It is relatively low maintenance and thrives in nutrient-poor conditions."
