    "intro": "Cassia fasciculata, commonly known as golden shower tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its dense, raceme-like inflorescences of yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its bark is often smooth and grayish in color. Cassia fasciculata is also valued for its medicinal properties, with various parts of the plant used in traditional remedies. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
