    "intro": "Castilleja brooksii, commonly known as Brooks' paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes numerous parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its bright red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it relies on a network of roots to absorb water and nutrients from its host plants. Castilleja brooksii is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands."
