    "intro": "Claytonia composita, commonly known as the Sierra sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a rosette of fleshy, grass-like leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to cold, dry environments."
