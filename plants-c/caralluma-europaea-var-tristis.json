    "intro": "Caralluma europaea var. tristis, commonly known as the European prickly pear, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe. It features a short, branched stem with spiny, fleshy leaves that help it store water. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought. Its structure and growth habits reflect its role as a xerophyte in Mediterranean climates."
