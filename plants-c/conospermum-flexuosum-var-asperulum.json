    "intro": "Conospermum flexuosum var. asperulum, commonly known as the rough-leaved conospermum, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are rough to the touch, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments. Its ornamental value and hardiness make it a popular choice for native gardens."
