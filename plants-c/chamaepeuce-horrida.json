    "intro": "Chamaepeuce horrida, commonly known as the horrid thimbleweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils in open woodlands and along streambanks. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, bristly hairs. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in a dense, spiky inflorescence at the top of the stem. The species is characterized by its rough, sometimes prickly texture, which gives it its common name."
