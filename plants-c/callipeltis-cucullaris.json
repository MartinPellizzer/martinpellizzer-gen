    "intro": "Callipeltis cucullaris, commonly known as the hooded tephritid, is a species of fruit fly found primarily in tropical regions. It belongs to the family Tephritidae and is characterized by its distinctive hood-like structure over the head. The plant it is associated with, typically a member of the Solanaceae family, provides the larvae with a suitable environment for development. Its life cycle involves laying eggs in the fruit, which then hatch into larvae that feed on the pulp. This species plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat through its interactions with host plants and other organisms."
