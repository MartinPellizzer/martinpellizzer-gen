    "intro": "Cerastium papuanum var. blepharipetalum, commonly known as the Papuan mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are typically hairy and succulent. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
