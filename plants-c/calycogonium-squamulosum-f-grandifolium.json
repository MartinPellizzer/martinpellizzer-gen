    "intro": "Calycogonium squamulosum f. grandifolium, commonly known as the grandifoliate calycogonium, is a unique variant of the calycogonium species. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces distinctive, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It is a herbaceous plant that thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This form is of interest to botanists due to its morphological differences from the typical calycogonium species."
