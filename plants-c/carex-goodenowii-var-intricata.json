    "intro": "Carex goodenowii var. intricata, commonly known as the intricate sedge, is a perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant prefers moist to wet soils and partial to full shade, making it a common sight in swampy or wetland environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This species is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and ornamental appeal."
