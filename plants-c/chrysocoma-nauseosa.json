    "intro": "Chrysocoma nauseosa, commonly known as the stinking rock rose, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky, arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping it conserve water in dry climates. Despite its common name, it is not particularly toxic, though its strong odor may deter some herbivores."
