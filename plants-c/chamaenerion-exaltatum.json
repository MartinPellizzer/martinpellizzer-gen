It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in open fields. The plant features tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Fireweed is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize areas after wildfires or other disturbances."
