    "intro": "Cyclosorus stramineus, commonly known as the golden thread fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features a creeping rhizome with clusters of narrow, bright green, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky texture. The fronds are usually less than 30 cm in length and have a distinctive, almost grass-like appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
