    "intro": "Cnicus verutus, commonly known as the prickly lettuce, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often considered a weed. Its seeds are small and can be dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread easily. Cnicus verutus has been used historically in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
