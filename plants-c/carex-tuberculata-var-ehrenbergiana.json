    "intro": "Carex tuberculata var. ehrenbergiana, commonly known as the Ehrenberg's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. This variety is distinguished by its finely textured foliage and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological value."
