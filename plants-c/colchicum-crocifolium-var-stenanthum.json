    "intro": "Colchicum crocifolium var. stenanthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often mistaken for those of other crocus species. It produces a capsule fruit containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
