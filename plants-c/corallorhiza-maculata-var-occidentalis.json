    "intro": "Corallorhiza maculata var. occidentalis, commonly known as the western pink root, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to western North America. It is a non-photosynthetic plant that relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for its nutrients, making it a hemiparasitic species. The plant produces a single, fleshy, pinkish root that is often the only visible part of the plant. It lacks leaves and flowers, instead producing a spike of small, pale pink or white flowers. This species is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and forest edges."
