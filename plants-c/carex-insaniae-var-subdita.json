    "intro": "Carex insaniae var. subdita, commonly known as the subdite sedge, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the Carex insaniae species. It is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, strap-shaped leaves. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes or along stream banks, where it thrives in shaded conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are often green or brown in color. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Carex insaniae var. subdita is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
