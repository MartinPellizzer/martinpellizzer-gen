    "intro": "Ceratostylis arfakensis, commonly known as the Arfaken orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stem and delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip that is a key feature of its morphology. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing epiphytically on trees or rocks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
