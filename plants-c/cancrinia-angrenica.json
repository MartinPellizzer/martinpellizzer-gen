It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its small, white to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, hot climates.

Due to its habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
