    "intro": "Cardamine amara var. erubescens, commonly known as the scarlet watercress, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with four petals, which are arranged in racemes. Its roots are edible and have a peppery flavor similar to other members of the mustard family. This variety is distinguished by its bright red stems and leaves, which give it its common name."
