    "intro": "Caladenia bicolor, commonly known as the pink fairy orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family found primarily in southern Australia. This terrestrial herbaceous plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Its flowers are characterized by their vivid pink color and a distinctive, elongated labellum that sets it apart from other orchid species. The plant produces a single spike with several flowers, each featuring three sepals and three petals, with the labellum being the most prominent feature. Caladenia bicolor is a short-lived species, with its life cycle often spanning several years, and it relies on specific pollinators for successful reproduction."
