    "intro": "Cornus sericea f. stolonifera, commonly known as silky dogwood or silverleaf stolonifera, is a variant of the silky dogwood species. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant features finely textured, silver-gray leaves that provide ornamental value in gardens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This form is notable for its stoloniferous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies."
