    "intro": "Cirsium acaule, commonly known as the naked stem thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, spiny stems that are often hairless, giving it its common name. The plant produces purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with serrated edges and covered in fine hairs. Cirsium acaule is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, and it is known for its hardy, drought-resistant nature."
