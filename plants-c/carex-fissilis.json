    "intro": "Carex fissilis, commonly known as the split-leaved sedge, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically blooming in late summer. Carex fissilis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
