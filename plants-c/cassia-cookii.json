    "intro": "Cassia cookii, commonly known as Cook's cassia, is a flowering plant native to the island of Samoa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes and is characterized by its pod-like fruits. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. Cassia cookii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in the Pacific region."
