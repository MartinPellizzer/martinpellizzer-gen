    "intro": "Calceolaria tripartita subsp. yuparum, commonly known as the Yuparum slipper orchid, is a herbaceous plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive calyx-like pouch, which resembles a slipper, a feature typical of the Calceolaria genus. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often arranged in clusters. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
