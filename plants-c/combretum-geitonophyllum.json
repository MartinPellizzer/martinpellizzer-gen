It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually ovate or elliptical in shape. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or on limestone outcrops. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds."
