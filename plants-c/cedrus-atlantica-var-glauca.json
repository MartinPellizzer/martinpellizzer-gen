    "intro": "Cedrus atlantica var. glauca, commonly known as the Atlas Cedar, is a cultivar of the Atlas cedar tree native to the mountainous regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its bluish-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. The plant is a coniferous evergreen with a conical shape and dense, needle-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a landscape specimen. Its slow growth rate and cold hardiness make it a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates."
