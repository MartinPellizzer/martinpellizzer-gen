    "intro": "Catopsis nutans var. erecta, commonly known as the erect catopsis, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to Central and South America, particularly found in humid, tropical regions. This plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, with dense rosettes of narrow, strap-like leaves. The leaves are typically dark green and may have a waxy coating, which helps in water retention. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often hidden within the leaf rosette, contributing to its unique botanical appearance."
