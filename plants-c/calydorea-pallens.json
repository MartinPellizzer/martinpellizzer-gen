    "intro": "Calydorea pallens, commonly known as the pale calydorea, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its tropical habitat. Calydorea pallens is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and mountainous regions."
