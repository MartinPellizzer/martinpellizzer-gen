    "intro": "Cirsium nidulans, commonly known as the downy thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, glandular leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance, and its flowers are arranged in a dense, spherical cluster. Cirsium nidulans is often found in disturbed areas and can spread through both seeds and vegetative means."
