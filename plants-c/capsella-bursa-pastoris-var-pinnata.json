    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris var. pinnata, commonly known as the heartleaf common chickweed, is a variant of the common chickweed species. It is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, but now widespread in temperate regions. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a heart-shaped base, and its flowers are small, white, and clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, triangular seed pods that disperse easily."
