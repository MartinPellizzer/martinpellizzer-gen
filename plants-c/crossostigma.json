It is characterized by its upright, herbaceous growth habit and distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are small and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, typically greenish or reddish in color.

They are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
