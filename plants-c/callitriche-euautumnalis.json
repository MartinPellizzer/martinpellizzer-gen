    "intro": "Callitriche euautumnalis, commonly known as autumn water star, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, branching stems that often lie close to the water's surface, with small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, floating on the water or partially submerged. Callitriche euautumnalis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and contributing to water quality through its dense growth."
