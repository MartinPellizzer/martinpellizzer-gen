    "intro": "Calia conzattii, commonly known as the Conzatti's calico, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its vibrant, multicolored petals that resemble a patchwork of different hues, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, adding a splash of color to its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Calia conzattii is considered a conservation concern."
