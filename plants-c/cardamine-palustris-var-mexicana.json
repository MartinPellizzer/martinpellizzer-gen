    "intro": "Cardamine palustris var. mexicana, commonly known as Mexican watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in Mexico. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in a raceme, which are pollinated by insects. Its root system is fibrous, helping it anchor in muddy or waterlogged soils. This variety is closely related to other members of the Ranunculaceae family, sharing similar morphological traits and ecological preferences."
