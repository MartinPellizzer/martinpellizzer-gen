    "intro": "Corispermum chinganicum var. stellipile, commonly known as the star-petaled corispermum, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb with distinctive, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has small, fleshy leaves and produces small, spherical fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
