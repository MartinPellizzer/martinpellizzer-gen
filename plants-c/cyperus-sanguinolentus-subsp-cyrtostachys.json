    "intro": "Cyperus sanguinolentus subsp. cyrtostachys, commonly known as the red sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to aquatic environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often reddish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
