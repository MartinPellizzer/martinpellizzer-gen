It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with distinctive cruciform flowers. The plant is characterized by its tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It grows in coastal areas and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its small size and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
