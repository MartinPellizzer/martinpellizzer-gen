It is characterized by its thick, waxy, dark green leaves that are often glossy and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in panicles. These flowers are followed by orange to red berries that contain several seeds. Clusia trochiformis is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental foliage."
