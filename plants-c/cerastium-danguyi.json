    "intro": "Cerastium danguyi, commonly known as the Danguyi mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and forest edges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
