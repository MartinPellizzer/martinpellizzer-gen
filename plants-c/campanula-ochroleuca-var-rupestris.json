    "intro": "Campanula ochroleuca var. rupestris, commonly known as the rock bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that often grow in rocky or gravelly habitats. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pale yellow or white flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
