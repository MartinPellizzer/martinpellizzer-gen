    "intro": "Capparis mitchellii, commonly known as the Mitchell's caper, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its woody stems and thorny branches. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, green berries. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly succulent texture, adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. Capparis mitchellii is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in indigenous cultures."
