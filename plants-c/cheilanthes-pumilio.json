    "intro": "Cheilanthes pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and rocky environments in the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows on limestone or sandstone outcrops. The plant has a compact rosette of fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into narrow, linear leaves. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a thick, waxy cuticle that reduces water loss. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a distinctive and resilient member of the rock-dwelling flora."
