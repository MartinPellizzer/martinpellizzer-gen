    "intro": "Carex cumulata f. soluta, commonly known as the Solitary Sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spikes of small, usually pale green or brownish flowers. This variety is notable for its solitary flowering spikes, which distinguish it from other Carex species. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes or along the edges of ponds. The plant's rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
