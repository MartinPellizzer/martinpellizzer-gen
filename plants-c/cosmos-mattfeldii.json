    "intro": "Cosmos mattfeldii, commonly known as Mexican feather grass, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, grass-like stems with delicate, feathery leaves that are finely divided and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, blooming from summer to fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance make it an ideal plant for arid and semi-arid landscapes."
