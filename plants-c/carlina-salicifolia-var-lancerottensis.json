    "intro": "Carlina salicifolia var. lancerottensis, commonly known as the Lancerottensis Carlina, is a rare endemic species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and large, silvery-green leaves with a distinctive serrated margin. The plant produces showy, yellow-centered composite flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern."
