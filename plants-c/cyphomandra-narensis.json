    "intro": "Cyphomandra narensis, commonly known as the Nares's bitter apple, is a species of nightshade plant native to South America. It is characterized by its small, green, fleshy fruits that contain a high concentration of alkaloids, making them toxic if ingested. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and lobed, with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, white flowers. Due to its toxic properties, it is not cultivated for food but is studied for its chemical compounds."
