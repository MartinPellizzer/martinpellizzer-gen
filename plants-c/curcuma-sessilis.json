    "intro": "Curcuma sessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved turmeric, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers, which are often borne on tall, leafy stems. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a smooth, waxy surface. The rhizomes of Curcuma sessilis are used in traditional medicine and have been studied for their potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties."
