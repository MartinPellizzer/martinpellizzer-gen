    "intro": "Caltha leptosepala var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf marsh marigold, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It features bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has alternate, broadly ovate to round leaves that are often hairy on the underside. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its rounded leaf shape, which sets it apart from other varieties of Caltha."
