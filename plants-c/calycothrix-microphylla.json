    "intro": "Calycothrix microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved calycothrix, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in rocky and sandy soils. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. Calycothrix microphylla is typically found in open habitats such as grasslands and along coastal areas. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions, though it remains relatively uncommon in horticultural trade."
