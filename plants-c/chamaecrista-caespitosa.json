    "intro": "Chamaecrista caespitosa, commonly known as coastal bluemink, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, clump-forming growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in spikes, which are followed by narrow, bean-like pods. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is adapted to saline and well-drained environments. Chamaecrista caespitosa plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and improving soil fertility through nitrogen fixation."
