    "intro": "Condalia microphylla var. lineata, commonly known as the lineated burr acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It features small, leathery leaves that are often lined with white or pale markings, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, spiny pods containing seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for coastal or sandy soils. The species is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental foliage."
