    "intro": "Catopsis schumanniana, commonly known as the Schumann's catopsis, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in areas with high humidity and warm climates. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a feature common among many bromeliads. Its inflorescence consists of small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, or yellow. This species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
