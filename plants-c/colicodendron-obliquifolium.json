    "intro": "Colicodendron obliquifolium, commonly known as the crooked-leaf colicodendron, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that curve in an unusual manner, giving it its common name. The plant belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and it exhibits a shrub-like growth habit. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically producing a pale yellow or greenish hue. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
