    "intro": "Cyperus ascolepidioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as swamps, rice fields, and along waterways. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces three-sided, boat-shaped fruits. Cyperus ascolepidioides is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
