    "intro": "Cephalocereus guentheri, commonly known as the silver crown cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and a dense crown of white, woolly spines. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers during the night, which are pollinated by bats. Its foliage is minimal, with spines covering most of the stem for protection. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun."
