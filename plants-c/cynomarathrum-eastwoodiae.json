    "intro": "Cynomarathrum eastwoodiae, commonly known as Eastwood's ghostflower, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, white, umbel-like inflorescence and finely divided, fern-like leaves. Native to the coastal regions of southern California, it thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune habitats. The plant is notable for its ephemeral blooming period, typically occurring in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
