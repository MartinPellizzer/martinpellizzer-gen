    "intro": "Campanula minutissima, commonly known as the tiny bellflower, is a small perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its miniature, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
