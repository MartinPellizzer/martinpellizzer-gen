    "intro": "Cereus tricostatus, commonly known as the three-ribbed cactus, is a species native to southern Africa. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, green stems and sparse, spiny areoles. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its succulent structure. It produces pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts."
