    "intro": "Cissus tetraptera, commonly known as the four-winged fig-leaf gooseberry, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Vitaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by edible, berry-like fruits that are slightly sour in taste. Its stems are often covered in tendrils that help it climb and spread across surfaces. Cissus tetraptera is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
