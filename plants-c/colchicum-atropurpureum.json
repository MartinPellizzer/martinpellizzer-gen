    "intro": "Colchicum atropurpureum, commonly known as the purple autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn, typically from August to October. The plant has basal leaves that are dark green and often have a waxy coating, and its stem is erect with a single, showy flower. It produces a distinctive, helmet-shaped corm that serves as its storage organ. The plant is adapted to grow in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
