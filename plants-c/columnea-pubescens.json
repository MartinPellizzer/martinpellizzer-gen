    "intro": "Columnea pubescens, commonly known as the hairy flame or the scarlet flame, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red or orange tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or a climbing plant, with opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, pubescent hairs. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds, which are attracted to its nectar-rich blooms. Columnea pubescens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
