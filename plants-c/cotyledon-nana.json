    "intro": "Cotyledon nana, commonly known as the dwarf cotyledon, is a compact, succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with red or purple margins, which help it store water and withstand drought. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires plenty of sunlight to maintain its vibrant coloration. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
