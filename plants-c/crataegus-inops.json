    "intro": "Crataegus inops, commonly known as the slender hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of small white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Crataegus inops typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or streamside habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
