    "intro": "Carex juvenilis, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers in the summer. It thrives in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats where it helps prevent erosion. Carex juvenilis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and aesthetic appeal."
