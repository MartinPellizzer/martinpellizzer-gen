    "intro": "Cyperus teneriffae var. longimucronatus, commonly known as the Long-point Cyperus, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance. It is native to the Canary Islands, specifically Tenerife, and thrives in coastal and sandy environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it resilient in its native habitat. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
