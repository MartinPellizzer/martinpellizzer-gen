    "intro": "Cyclophorus glaber, commonly known as the smooth cyclophorus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is native to parts of Asia, particularly China and Japan, where it grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant features a slender, upright stem with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are smooth to the touch. Its small, white flowers are arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Cyclophorus glaber is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and subtle floral display."
