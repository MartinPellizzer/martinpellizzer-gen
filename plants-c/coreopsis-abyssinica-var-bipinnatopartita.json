It features slender, branching stems that grow upright, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers with yellow ray florets and a yellow disk, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are deeply lobed, with a bipinnate structure that gives it a feathery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes."
