    "intro": "Clerodendrum hispidum, commonly known as the hairy clerodendrum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its rough, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom throughout the warm seasons. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Clerodendrum hispidum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
