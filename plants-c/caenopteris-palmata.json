    "intro": "Caenopteris palmata, commonly known as the palmate water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are palmately divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, contributing to water filtration and habitat creation for aquatic life. Caenopteris palmata plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in its native habitats."
