    "intro": "Cotoneaster turbinatus, commonly known as the Turban cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, glossy, oval-shaped leaves that turn red in the fall, adding ornamental value to the landscape. The plant produces clusters of white to pink flowers in the spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for garden landscapes. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a popular ornamental plant in temperate climates."
