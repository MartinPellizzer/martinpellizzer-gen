    "intro": "Comesperma strictum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed boxwood, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. Comesperma strictum is also valued for its ability to tolerate coastal conditions and poor soil."
