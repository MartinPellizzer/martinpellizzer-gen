    "intro": "Cephalocereus polygonus, commonly known as the night bloomer cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a tall, columnar cactus with a ribbed stem and spines that provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Its striking appearance and unique blooming habit make it a popular choice for desert gardens."
