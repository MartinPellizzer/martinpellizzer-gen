    "intro": "Centaurea stoebe subsp. serbica, commonly known as Serbian knapweed, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It features upright, branched stems that can grow up to 1 meter tall, covered with fine, hairy structures. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in composite-like inflorescences, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with serrated edges, and the plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in various soil types. It is often found in grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides, and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
