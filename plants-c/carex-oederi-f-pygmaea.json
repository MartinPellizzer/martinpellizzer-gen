    "intro": "Carex oederi f. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to the wetlands of North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spikelets along the stems. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Its dense growth habit makes it an excellent choice for stabilizing soil in aquatic environments."
