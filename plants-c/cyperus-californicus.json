    "intro": "Cyperus californicus, commonly known as the California flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to aquatic habitats. The plant has slender, grass-like stems and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its rhizomes help it spread and establish dense colonies in wet soil. Cyperus californicus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
