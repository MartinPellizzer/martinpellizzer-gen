    "intro": "Coutarea pterosperma, commonly known as the silky tree, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers. The tree can grow up to 15 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a dense canopy of dark green leaves. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is known for its ornamental value in tropical gardens. The bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to potential toxicity."
