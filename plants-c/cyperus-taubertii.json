It belongs to the sedge family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along water edges, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Cyperus taubertii produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in inflorescences. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
