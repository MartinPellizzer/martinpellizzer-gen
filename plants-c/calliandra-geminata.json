    "intro": "Calliandra geminata, commonly known as the pink calliandra, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery inflorescences composed of numerous small, pink to red flowers. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically growing up to 5 meters in height. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two sets of small leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. Calliandra geminata is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its vibrant flowers and drought tolerance."
