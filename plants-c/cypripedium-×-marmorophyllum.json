    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 marmorophyllum, commonly known as the marbled lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid species characterized by its distinctive marbled patterns on its petals and sepals. It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly in China, where it thrives in cool, humid climates. The plant produces showy, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white with a contrasting lip. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly in suitable habitats. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
