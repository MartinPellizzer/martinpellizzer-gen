    "intro": "Caladenia nikulinskyae, commonly known as the Nikulinsky's Spider-orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Western Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate, spider-like appearance with a single, slender flower. The plant typically grows in sandy soils within heathlands and woodlands, thriving in specific microclimates. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinctive hooded labellum that resembles a spider's body. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
