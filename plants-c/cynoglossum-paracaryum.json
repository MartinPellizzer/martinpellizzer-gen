    "intro": "Cynoglossum paracaryum, commonly known as the African bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from purple to blue, often with a contrasting white or yellow throat. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early autumn."
