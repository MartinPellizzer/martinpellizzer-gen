    "intro": "Cereaster setaceus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often used in coastal landscaping for its ornamental value. Its flowers are tubular and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cereaster setaceus is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate periods of drought."
