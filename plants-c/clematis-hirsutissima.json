    "intro": "Clematis hirsutissima, commonly known as the woolly clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and large, showy flowers that range from white to deep purple. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Clematis hirsutissima is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to climb trellises or walls."
