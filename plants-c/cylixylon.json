It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in fine, silvery hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, often with a slightly hairy surface. Cylixylon produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
