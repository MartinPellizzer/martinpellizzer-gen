    "intro": "Campanula cochleariifolia subf. gracilescens, commonly known as the slender bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features upright, slender stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of blue or violet. The leaves are lanceolate and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its rugged appearance. This subspecies thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
