    "intro": "Cynosurus brizoides, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like vegetation and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes other grasses, and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. Cynosurus brizoides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
