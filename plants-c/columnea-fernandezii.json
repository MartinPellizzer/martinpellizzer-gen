    "intro": "Columnea fernandezii, commonly known as the Fernandez's flame flower, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom during the warmer months. The plant typically grows as a shrub or climbing vine, with opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its unique floral structure attracts hummingbirds and other pollinators, making it an important species in its ecosystem. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
