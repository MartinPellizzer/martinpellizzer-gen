    "intro": "Cyperus richardii var. angustior, commonly known as narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its small, three-lobed flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. The variety angustior is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Cyperus richardii."
