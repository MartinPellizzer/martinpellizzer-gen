    "intro": "Cracca dasycarpa, commonly known as the rough-fruited cracca, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in dry, rocky environments. The plant is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that contains several seeds, contributing to its survival in arid conditions."
