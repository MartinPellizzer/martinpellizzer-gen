    "intro": "Columnea ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty columnea, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a velvety texture and a reddish-brown underside. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Columnea ferruginea is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
