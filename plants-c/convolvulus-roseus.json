It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and containers. Its rapid growth and ability to climb or trail make it both ornamental and somewhat invasive in certain regions."
