    "intro": "Calathea aemula, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that often display intricate patterns in shades of green, silver, and pink. The plant's foliage changes color in response to light conditions, a phenomenon known as nyctinasty. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Calathea aemula is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
