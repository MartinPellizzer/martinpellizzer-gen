    "intro": "Crataegus ceratocarpa, commonly known as the horned hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches, which give it its common name, and its clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along streambanks. The bark is typically smooth and gray, with a distinctive flaky texture that becomes more pronounced with age."
