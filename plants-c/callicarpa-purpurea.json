    "intro": "Callicarpa purpurea, commonly known as the purple beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by striking clusters of purple berries in the fall. The berries are edible for humans and some birds but are generally not considered highly palatable. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract wildlife."
