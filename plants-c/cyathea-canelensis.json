    "intro": "Cyathea canelensis, commonly known as the Canelensis tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the Caribbean, particularly found in parts of Cuba and Hispaniola. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in ideal conditions. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, providing structural support and enabling it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are typically dark green and remain evergreen throughout the year, contributing to its ornamental value in tropical landscapes."
