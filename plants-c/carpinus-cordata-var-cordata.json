    "intro": "Carpinus cordata var. cordata, commonly known as the common hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and woodlands. The tree is valued for its hard, dense wood and its role in providing habitat for various wildlife species."
