    "intro": "Clidemia aphanantha var. drosera, commonly known as the sticky leaf plant, is a species native to the wet tropical forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which helps in trapping small insects. The plant is a member of the Melastomataceae family and typically grows as an understory shrub in shaded environments. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with vibrant colors that attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. The plant's unique adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study and ecological research."
