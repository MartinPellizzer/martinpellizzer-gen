    "intro": "Cicuta trachypleura, commonly known as the rough cowbane, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its distinctive, fern-like foliage and hollow stems. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in wet meadows and along riverbanks. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its roots contain toxic compounds, making it potentially dangerous to both humans and livestock. Despite its toxicity, it plays a role in supporting certain insect populations and contributes to the ecological diversity of wetland habitats."
