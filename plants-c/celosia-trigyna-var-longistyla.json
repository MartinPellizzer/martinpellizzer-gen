    "intro": "Celosia trigyna var. longistyla, commonly known as the flame flower or crown of thorns, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant, spiky bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers at the base of the bract clusters, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and container planting. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a versatile and eye-catching addition to tropical and subtropical landscapes."
