It is characterized by its long, drooping panicles of yellow flowers that resemble candles, hence its common name. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It produces pods that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cassia arachoides is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities."
