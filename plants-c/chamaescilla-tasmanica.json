    "intro": "Chamaescilla tasmanica, commonly known as the Tasmanian snowgrass, is a low-growing shrub native to the cool, moist regions of Tasmania. It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its cool, humid habitat. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in shaded to semi-shaded conditions and is often found in heathlands and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in Tasmania."
