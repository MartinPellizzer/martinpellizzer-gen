It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round, orange-colored fruits that are edible and often consumed by local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
