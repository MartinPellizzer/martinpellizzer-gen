It is characterized by its elongated peduncles, which are the stalks supporting the flower clusters. The plant typically produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are ovate and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value. This cultivar is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and as a specimen plant."
