    "intro": "Centaurea involucrata var. discolor, commonly known as the Variable Cornflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers, which are typically surrounded by a mix of white and blue bracts. The plant grows in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, often in dry or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, and the stems are upright with a slightly woody base. The species is noted for its variability in flower color and leaf morphology, contributing to its common name."
