    "intro": "Cyclosorus menisciicarpos, commonly known as the spiral liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Ptilidiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that form a dense, cushion-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are embedded within the thallus and produce spores. Cyclosorus menisciicarpos plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates."
