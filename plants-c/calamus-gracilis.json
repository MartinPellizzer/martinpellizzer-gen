It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and narrow, elongated leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spadices, a common feature among arum family members. Calamus gracilis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks. It is valued in traditional medicine and is also used in the production of rattan and other handicrafts."
