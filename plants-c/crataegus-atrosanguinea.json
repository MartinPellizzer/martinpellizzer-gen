    "intro": "Crataegus atrosanguinea, commonly known as the blackthorn or sloe, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are enclosed in a sticky, waxy coating. The plant has thorny branches and small, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. The berries are used in culinary and medicinal applications, though they are typically harvested when fully ripe."
