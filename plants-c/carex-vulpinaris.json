    "intro": "Carex vulpinaris, commonly known as the foxglove sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spadix-like flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as wetlands, stream banks, and woodland areas. Carex vulpinaris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
