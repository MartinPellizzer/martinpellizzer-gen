It consists of several species that are typically small, herbaceous plants with simple, alternate leaves. The flowers are usually small and consist of four petals arranged in a cross shape, a characteristic feature of the Brassicaceae family. These plants are often found in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. They play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
