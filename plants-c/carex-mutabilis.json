It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. Carex mutabilis thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its adaptability to wet environments makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
