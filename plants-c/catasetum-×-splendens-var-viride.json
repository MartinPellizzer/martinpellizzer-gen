    "intro": "Catasetum \u00d7 splendens var. viride, commonly known as the green orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant green foliage and striking, often fragrant flowers that can range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. It produces specialized pollinia that are transferred by specific insect pollinators, a unique feature of the Catasetum genus. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is cultivated in both greenhouse and outdoor settings."
