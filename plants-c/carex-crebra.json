    "intro": "Carex crebra, commonly known as narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in three rows. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like structures called spikelets. Carex crebra thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
