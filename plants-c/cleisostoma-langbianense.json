It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows on tree branches or rocks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to retain water in its humid, tropical habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
