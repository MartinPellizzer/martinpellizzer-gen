    "intro": "Cotoneaster racemiflorus var. kotscheyi, commonly known as the Kotschey cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, woody stems with thorn-like branches. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that persist into winter. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, turning yellow in autumn. It is well adapted to harsh, alpine environments and is often found in rocky soils."
