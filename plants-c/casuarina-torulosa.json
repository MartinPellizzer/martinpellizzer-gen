    "intro": "Casuarina torulosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved she-oak, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its needle-like leaves and distinctive cone-like structures. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by woody, cylindrical fruits that contain seeds. Casuarina torulosa is often used in reforestation projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
