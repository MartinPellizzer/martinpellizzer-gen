    "intro": "Cliocarpus didymus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhizophoraceae. It is native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, narrow leaves and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. Cliocarpus didymus has specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which help it breathe in oxygen-poor tidal soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
