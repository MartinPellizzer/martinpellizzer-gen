    "intro": "Cytisus triflorus var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous broom, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has trifoliate leaves, meaning each leaf is composed of three leaflets, which are typically oval and hairy. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal and rocky habitats. Its ornamental value comes from its bright yellow flowers and compact growth habit."
