    "intro": "Carex fusca subsp. carpetana, commonly known as the carpet sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense mats of grass-like foliage, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are usually wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and other damp habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
