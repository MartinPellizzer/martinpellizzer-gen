    "intro": "Cycas clivicola, commonly known as the cliff cycas, is a rare cycad species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male cones at the base and female cones at the top, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
