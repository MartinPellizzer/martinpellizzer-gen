It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly folded or compressed, giving it its varietal name \"impressa.\" The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a spike, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along streams, ponds, and marshes. This sedge is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
