    "intro": "Chorizanthe insignis, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers, which are often pink or red, bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
