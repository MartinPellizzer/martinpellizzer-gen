    "intro": "Condea scoparioides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the rainforests of Australia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has delicate, strap-like leaves and produces small, pale green flowers that bloom in spring. It is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it a species of conservation concern. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is often sought after by botanists and orchid enthusiasts."
