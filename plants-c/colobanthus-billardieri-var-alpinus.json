    "intro": "Colobanthus billardieri var. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine pearlwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high elevations or in rockeries."
