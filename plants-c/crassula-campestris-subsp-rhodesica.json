    "intro": "Crassula campestris subsp. rhodesica, commonly known as the Rhodes ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions."
