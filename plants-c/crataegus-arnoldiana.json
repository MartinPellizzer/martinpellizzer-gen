    "intro": "Crataegus arnoldiana, commonly known as Arnold's hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 feet and features thorned branches, which are a characteristic feature of the genus Crataegus. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and they turn yellow or red in autumn. Arnold's hawthorn is often found in woodland edges and moist soils, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
