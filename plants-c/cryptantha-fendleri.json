It is a member of the Boraginaceae family, characterized by its hairy stems and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. Cryptantha fendleri plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
