    "intro": "Coffea kaduana, commonly known as the Kaduana coffee plant, is a species native to the highland regions of Ethiopia. It is a small shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1-2 meters. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds used for coffee production. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, with a serrated edge. While it shares some characteristics with other coffee species, it is less commonly cultivated due to its limited yield and specific growing conditions."
