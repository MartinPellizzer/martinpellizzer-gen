    "intro": "Cercestis dinklagei, commonly known as the Dinklage's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with translucent, waxy petals and a slender, elongated flower spike. Native to the tropical rainforests of Ecuador, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall. Its flowers are typically pale green or yellowish-white, with intricate patterns that resemble ghostly figures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cercestis dinklagei is considered critically endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
