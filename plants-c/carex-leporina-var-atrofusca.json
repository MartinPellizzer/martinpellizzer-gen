    "intro": "Carex leporina var. atrofusca, commonly known as the black-stem sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its tall, upright stems that are typically dark green to black in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it an effective pioneer species in disturbed wetlands. It prefers full sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist to waterlogged soil conditions."
