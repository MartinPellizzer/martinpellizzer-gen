    "intro": "Coelorachis clathrata, commonly known as the basket fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that form a dense, basket-shaped structure. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky surfaces or tree trunks. The basket fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
