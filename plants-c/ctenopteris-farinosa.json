    "intro": "Ctenopteris farinosa, commonly known as the farinose sea\u84b2\u516c\u82f1, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fluffy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor. The spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds."
