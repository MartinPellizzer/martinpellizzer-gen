    "intro": "Cololobus ruschianus, commonly known as the R\u00fcsch's colobus, is a species of colobus monkey found in the forests of East Africa. This primate is characterized by its long, slender body and a distinctive black-and-white coat. It has a prehensile tail that aids in arboreal movement, allowing it to navigate the canopy with ease. The R\u00fcsch's colobus primarily feeds on leaves, fruits, and flowers, playing a vital role in seed dispersal within its ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and hunting, this species is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
