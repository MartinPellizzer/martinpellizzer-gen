    "intro": "Crataegus egens, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red berries known as haws, which are important for wildlife during the fall. Crataegus egens is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and other disturbed habitats due to its adaptability and hardy nature. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of ecological systems and a popular ornamental plant."
