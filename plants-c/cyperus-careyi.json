    "intro": "Cyperus careyi, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features a rosette of grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in moist environments. Cyperus careyi is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive, upright form and adaptability to various water conditions."
