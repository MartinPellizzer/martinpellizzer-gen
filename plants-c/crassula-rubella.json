    "intro": "Crassula rubella, commonly known as the red crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge, especially under bright light. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and requiring minimal watering. Crassula rubella is popular as a houseplant due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements."
