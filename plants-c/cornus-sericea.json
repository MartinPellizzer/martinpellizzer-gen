    "intro": "Cornus sericea, commonly known as green-twig dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, greenish twigs and opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by red or purple berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Cornus sericea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for wildlife."
