    "intro": "Cynosurus effusus var. furtivus, commonly known as the creeping hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths on well-drained soils, often in open woodlands or grassy areas. The plant features slender, wiry stems covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting insect life."
