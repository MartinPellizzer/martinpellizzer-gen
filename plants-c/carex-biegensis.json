    "intro": "Carex biegensis, commonly known as Bieg's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to reddish in color, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Carex biegensis thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
