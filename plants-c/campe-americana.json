It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the Gulf Coast. The tree is characterized by its aromatic, rough bark and opposite, simple, elliptical leaves. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by egg-shaped, woody fruits. The plant is valued for its camphor-rich wood, which has been used historically in medicinal and aromatic applications."
