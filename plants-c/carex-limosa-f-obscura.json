    "intro": "Carex limosa f. obscura, commonly known as the dark fringed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, narrow leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is typically found in wetland habitats such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in moist environments."
