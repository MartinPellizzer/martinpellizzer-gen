    "intro": "Cottsia californica, commonly known as the California cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. It is adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat, with a shallow root system that allows it to efficiently absorb moisture. Cottsia californica is often found in coastal scrub and dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
