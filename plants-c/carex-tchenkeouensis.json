    "intro": "Carex tchenkeouensis, commonly known as the Tchenkeou sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to China and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and wetlands. The plant is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled berries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
