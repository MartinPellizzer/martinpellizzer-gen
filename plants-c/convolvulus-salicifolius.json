    "intro": "Convolvulus salicifolius, commonly known as the willow-leaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves that resemble willow leaves, hence its common name. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in the morning, giving it its other common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Convolvulus salicifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
