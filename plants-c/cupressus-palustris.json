    "intro": "Cupressus palustris, commonly known as the swamp cypress, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to wet, swampy environments. Its bark is reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age, and it is often found in wetland habitats. Cupressus palustris plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
