    "intro": "Cerastium alpinum subsp. pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
