The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and has opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are hairy on both surfaces. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and streambanks. Clethra incana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
