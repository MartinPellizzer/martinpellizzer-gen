    "intro": "Carex hirta var. hirtiformis-terrestris, commonly known as the hairy sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy, especially along the edges, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, three-ranked flowers, which are usually green to brown in color. This variant is notable for its distinctive morphology and ecological adaptability in wetland habitats."
