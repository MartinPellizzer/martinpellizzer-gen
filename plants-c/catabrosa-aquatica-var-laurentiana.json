    "intro": "Catabrosa aquatica var. laurentiana, commonly known as the Laurentian water-cress, is a aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as streams and ponds. The plant has thin, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged or floating. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. This variety is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
