    "intro": "Cedrus atlantica var. variegata, commonly known as the Atlas cedar variegated, is a striking evergreen conifer native to the Atlas Mountains of North Africa. It is characterized by its slow growth rate and distinctive foliage, which features a variegated pattern of yellow, white, and green on its needle-like leaves. The plant produces cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, and its bark is thick, fissured, and deeply furrowed. It thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its unique appearance and hardy nature."
