    "intro": "Carex chordorrhiza subsp. gynocrates, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 1 inch wide, with a smooth, waxy surface. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are followed by three-sided, capsule-like fruits. This subspecies is often found in disturbed wetlands and is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
