It typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as swampy areas and riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems and forms dense tussocks, with leaves that are narrow and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed flowers. It plays an important role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
