It is a member of the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its unique, woody structure and aromatic resinous sap. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, winged fruits. Its roots are highly valued for their medicinal properties and are used in traditional healing practices. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is critically endangered and protected under international conservation agreements."
