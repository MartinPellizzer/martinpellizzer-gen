    "intro": "Cabralea warmingiana var. coriacea, commonly known as the rough cabralea, is a shrub native to the dry forests of Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of short, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing some protection against environmental stress. The species is adapted to arid conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
