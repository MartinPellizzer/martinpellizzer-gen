    "intro": "Cephalaria stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cephalaria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and typically fibrous stems. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, yellowish to brownish composite flowers. Cephalaria stenophylla is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to arid and cold climates, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
