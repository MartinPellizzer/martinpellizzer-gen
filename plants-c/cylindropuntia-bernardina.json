    "intro": "Cylindropuntia bernardina, commonly known as the Bernard's cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, segmented stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. Its spines are relatively short and can be difficult to remove, making it a common plant in arid and semi-arid environments. Cylindropuntia bernardina is adapted to thrive in low-water conditions and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats."
