    "intro": "Cerastium arvense var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, hairy, ovate leaves that are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette at the base. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it an effective ground cover in certain environments."
