    "intro": "Cuscuta woodsonii, commonly known as the woodson's dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique, thread-like appearance due to its lack of true leaves. The plant is native to the southeastern United States and is often found growing on various host species such as sunflowers and goldenrod. Its reproductive strategy involves producing numerous tiny seeds that can remain viable in the soil for many years. The botanical study of Cuscuta woodsonii provides insights into parasitic plant adaptations and ecological interactions."
