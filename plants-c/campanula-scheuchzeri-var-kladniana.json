    "intro": "Campanula scheuchzeri var. kladniana, commonly known as the Kladnica bellflower, is a rare alpine plant native to the high mountain regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 1,500 meters. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
