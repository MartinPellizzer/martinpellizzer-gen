    "intro": "Caucalis scandicina, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground or climb slightly. Its flowers are bell-shaped, usually pink or white, and bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive botanical appearance."
