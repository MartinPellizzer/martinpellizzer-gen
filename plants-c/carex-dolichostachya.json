    "intro": "Carex dolichostachya, commonly known as the long-stalked sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and compact, cylindrical inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and is native to parts of North America. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, which can help stabilize soil in wetland environments. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with male and female flowers often found on separate plants."
