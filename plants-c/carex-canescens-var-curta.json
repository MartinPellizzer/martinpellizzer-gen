    "intro": "Carex canescens var. curta, commonly known as the short-stemmed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, greenish-brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological value."
