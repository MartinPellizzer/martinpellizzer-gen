    "intro": "Castilleja applegatei subsp. pallida, commonly known as the Applegate's paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red to orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, branching stems and is often found growing in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It forms symbiotic relationships with certain root fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil. This subspecies is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution."
