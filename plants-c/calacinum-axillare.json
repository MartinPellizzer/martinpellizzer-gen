    "intro": "Calacinum axillare, commonly known as the axillary calacine, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing structure with small, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the thin, rocky soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Calacinum axillare is considered a species of conservation concern."
