    "intro": "Crataegus flabellata var. densiflora, commonly known as the denseflower hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically before the leaves emerge. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are serrated along the edges and turn yellow in the fall. Its fruit is a red or orange pome that develops in late summer, containing several small seeds. This species is often found in moist, woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
