    "intro": "Currania, commonly known as the velvetleaf or swamp hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Malvaceae family. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants are characterized by their broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, often pink or purple, five-petaled flowers. Currania species typically thrive in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and forest understories. They produce capsule fruits that contain numerous small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind or water."
