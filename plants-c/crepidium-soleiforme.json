    "intro": "Crepidium soleiforme, commonly known as the flat-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which are typically short-lived. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
