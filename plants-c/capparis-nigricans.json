    "intro": "Capparis nigricans, commonly known as the blackcap or black thorn, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its woody, thorny stems and evergreen leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, red, fleshy fruits. Its botanical features include a complex root system adapted to arid conditions, and its flowers are visited by various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Capparis nigricans is often found in rocky or coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils."
