    "intro": "Choeradodia, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to regions of southern Africa. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that resemble dandelions. They are typically found in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Choeradodia species are often used in traditional medicine and are valued for their ornamental appeal."
