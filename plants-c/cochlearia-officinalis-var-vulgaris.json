    "intro": "Cochlearia officinalis var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common cochlearia, is a flowering plant native to the northern regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a compact raceme, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
