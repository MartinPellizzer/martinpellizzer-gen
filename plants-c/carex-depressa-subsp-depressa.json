    "intro": "Carex depressa subsp. depressa, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread vegetatively. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
