    "intro": "Crypsis phleoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient uptake, as it cannot photosynthesize due to its absence of chlorophyll. Its unique morphology and habitat requirements make it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Conservation efforts are critical to preserving this rare botanical species."
