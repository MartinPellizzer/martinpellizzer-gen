    "intro": "Caesia, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to various regions across the Americas, particularly in wetland and marshy habitats. Caesia species are characterized by their showy, often violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plants typically have linear leaves and produce small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. They play an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil."
