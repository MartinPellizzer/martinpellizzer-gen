    "intro": "Cotoneaster nummularius microphyllus, commonly known as the dwarf cotoneaster, is a low-growing shrub native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It features small, rounded, glossy green leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens due to its compact form and seasonal interest. Cotoneaster nummularius microphyllus thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
