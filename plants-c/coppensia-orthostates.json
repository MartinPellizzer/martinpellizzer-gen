    "intro": "Coppensia orthostates, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock heath, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a small, perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Coppensia orthostates is adapted to survive in harsh environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
