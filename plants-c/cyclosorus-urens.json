    "intro": "Cyclosorus urens, commonly known as the common water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its branching, ribbon-like leaves that resemble a clover leaf. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. Cyclosorus urens plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
