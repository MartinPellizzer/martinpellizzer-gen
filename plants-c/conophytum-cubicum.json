    "intro": "Conophytum cubicum, commonly known as the cubic stone plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rock-like appearance. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Conophytum cubicum is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
