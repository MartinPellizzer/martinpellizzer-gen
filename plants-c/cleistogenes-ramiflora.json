    "intro": "Cleistogenes ramiflora, commonly known as the ramiflorous grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soil and extreme temperatures. Cleistogenes ramiflora plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
