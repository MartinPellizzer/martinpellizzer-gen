    "intro": "Centaurea \u00d7 scopaeformis, commonly known as the hybrid cornflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Centaurea cyanus (blue cornflower) and Centaurea solstitialis (yellow star-thistle). The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright stems and lance-shaped leaves with rough textures. Its flowers are composite, consisting of blue to purple ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets, and bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed areas and along roadsides."
