    "intro": "Cenchrus occidentalis, commonly known as western sandreed, is a grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial plant characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Its rhizomatous root system enables it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Cenchrus occidentalis plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
