It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring intricate petal arrangements and a striking coloration. The plant typically grows in montane forest habitats, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its flowers are highly specialized, adapted for specific pollinators, and it plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its native region. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cirrhopetalum inabae is considered a vulnerable species."
