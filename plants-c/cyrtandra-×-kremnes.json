    "intro": "Cyrtandra \u00d7 kremnes, commonly known as the hybrid Cyrtandra, is a cross between Cyrtandra and Kremnes, two genera within the Gesneriaceae family. It is a flowering plant native to Hawaii, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. The plant typically produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are usually opposite, ovate, and have a waxy texture, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. Cyrtandra \u00d7 kremnes is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
