    "intro": "Cleisostoma dawsonianum, commonly known as the Dawson's cleistostoma, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are often short-lived, opening only briefly before closing, which is a unique trait among orchids. Cleisostoma dawsonianum is appreciated by orchid enthusiasts for its delicate appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
