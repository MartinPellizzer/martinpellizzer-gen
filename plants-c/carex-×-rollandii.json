    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 rollandii, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Carex acutata and Carex lyngbyei, characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical spikes of small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows, and is found in parts of North America. It has a clump-forming growth habit and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland conservation."
