    "intro": "Carphobolus axillaris, commonly known as the axillary burrgrass, is a perennial plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and the presence of small, spiny fruits that enclose seeds. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers. Due to its adaptability, it is considered a weed in some agricultural areas."
