It belongs to the Lythraceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous annual or perennial, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture, and it produces showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds.
