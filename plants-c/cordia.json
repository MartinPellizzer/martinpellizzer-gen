It includes over 200 species, many of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plants are characterized by their simple, opposite leaves and showy, often blue or white flowers. Some species produce fleshy, berry-like fruits that are edible and used in traditional medicine. Cordia species are also valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in their native habitats."
