The plant produces small, blue to purple flower heads that are surrounded by pale blue bracts, creating a striking visual effect. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils. This species is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas, where it contributes to biodiversity and ecological stability."
