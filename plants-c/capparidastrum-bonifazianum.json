    "intro": "Capparidastrum bonifazianum, commonly known as the dwarf caper, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its small, erect growth habit and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by capsule fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
