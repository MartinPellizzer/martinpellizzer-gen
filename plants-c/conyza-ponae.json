    "intro": "Conyza ponae, commonly known as the African ironweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters and features hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to yellowish composite flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Conyza ponae is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
