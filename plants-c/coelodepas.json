    "intro": "Coelodepas, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers. Its leaves are typically fleshy and succulent, adapted to the arid and high-altitude environments it inhabits. Coelodepas plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to extreme conditions."
