    "intro": "Cheilanthes saundersii, commonly known as the Saunders' rockcap, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, perennial fern that typically grows in rocky or crevice habitats, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces compact, dark green fronds with a leathery texture. Its sporangia are borne on the undersides of the fronds, and it is adapted to survive in low-nutrient, well-drained soils. This fern is often found in limestone or granite areas and is valued for its ornamental appearance and hardiness."
