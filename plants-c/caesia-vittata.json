    "intro": "Caesia vittata, commonly known as the narrowleaf false indigo, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with a distinct, narrow leaflet arrangement. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Caesia vittata plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
