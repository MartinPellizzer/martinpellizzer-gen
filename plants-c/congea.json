    "intro": "Congea, commonly known as the \"Bitterleaf\" or \"Congea paniculata,\" is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or yellowish flowers that are often followed by small, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Congea is also valued in some cultures for its ornamental appeal and as a source of natural dyes."
