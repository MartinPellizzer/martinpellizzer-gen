    "intro": "Cirsium orgyale, commonly known as the Tibetan thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny leaves and showy purple or blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its fibrous roots help it retain moisture in the dry climate, while its tall stem supports its large, composite flower heads. Cirsium orgyale is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for local pollinators."
