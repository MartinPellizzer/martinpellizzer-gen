    "intro": "Cydonia sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese quince, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It produces large, yellow-orange fruits that are typically harvested when they are dry and fully mature. The plant has rough, fissured bark and oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The flowers are pale yellow and appear in clusters, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries."
