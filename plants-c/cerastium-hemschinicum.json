    "intro": "Cerastium hemschinicum, commonly known as the Hemsch's mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, characterized by its small, often hairy leaves and clustered flowers. The plant produces white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically rounded and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture in its alpine habitat. Cerastium hemschinicum is often found in rocky soils and open meadows at high elevations."
