It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant features spines that are white or pale in color, which set it apart from other varieties of Cereus. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or white, blooming at night and emitting a faint fragrance. This species is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water and nutrient requirements."
