    "intro": "Cachrys echinophora, commonly known as the spiny hackberry, is a shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the Elaeagnaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves and clusters of small, edible berries. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species adapted to dry conditions. Its bark is often covered in small, spiny projections, which provide some protection from herbivores. The plant also has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing its ability to grow in poor soils."
