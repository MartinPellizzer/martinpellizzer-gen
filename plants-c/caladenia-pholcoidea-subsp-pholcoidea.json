    "intro": "Caladenia pholcoidea subsp. pholcoidea, commonly known as the Pholcoidea Spider-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats such as woodlands and heathlands. The plant produces a single, slender stem with a single, narrow, greenish-yellow flower that has a distinctive, intricate lip. It blooms during the late spring to early summer, and its flowers are pollinated primarily by thynnine wasps. This subspecies is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and fragmentation."
