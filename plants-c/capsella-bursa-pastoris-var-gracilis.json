    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender common chickweed, is a low-growing annual plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its slender, prostrate stems and small, alternate leaves that are often hairy. The flowers are typically white or pink, arranged in clusters and resembling a shepherd's purse, hence the species name \"bursa-pastoris.\" This variety is distinguished by its more delicate and elongated growth habit compared to the typical form. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides."
