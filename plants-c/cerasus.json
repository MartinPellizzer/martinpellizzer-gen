    "intro": "Cerasus, commonly known as the cherry, is a genus of flowering plants in the subfamily Prunoideae. It includes species such as the sweet cherry (Cerasus vulgaris) and the sour cherry (Cerasus cerasifera), which are widely cultivated for their edible fruits. The plants typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce showy, five-petaled flowers in spring. The fruit, which develops from the flower, is a drupe with a fleshy exterior and a hard pit. Cerasus species are valued for their ornamental beauty and agricultural importance in temperate regions."
