It is a large, evergreen fern that can grow up to several meters tall, with a thick, trunk-like stem covered in persistent, fibrous roots. The plant features a crown of arching fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a dark green, leathery texture. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores, which are dispersed by wind to propagate the species. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks."
