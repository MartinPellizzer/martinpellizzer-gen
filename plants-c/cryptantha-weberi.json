    "intro": "Cryptantha weberi, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Leguminosae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Cryptantha weberi is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy addition to xeriscaped gardens."
