It belongs to the Commelinaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers with white markings. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forests and wetlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, while its flowers are clustered in umbels. The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small, spiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal by wind or animals."
