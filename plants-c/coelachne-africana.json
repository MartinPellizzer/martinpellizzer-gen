It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. It is adapted to well-drained soils and can tolerate moderate drought conditions. Coelachne africana plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
