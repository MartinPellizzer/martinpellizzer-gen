    "intro": "Cotula loganii, commonly known as the golden groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a creeping stem that often forms dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Cotula loganii is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
