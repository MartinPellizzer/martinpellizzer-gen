    "intro": "Cerastium viscosum var. tenellum, commonly known as sticky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, hairy leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or coastal habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
