    "intro": "Cynorkis citrata, commonly known as the citron orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, yellow-orange flowers that resemble citrus fruits. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are long and narrow, often with a waxy surface, and it produces small, clustered blooms during the wet season. Cynorkis citrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
