It features long, arching stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that appear in summer, followed by distinctive, umbrella-like inflorescences. It is adapted to grow in well-drained soil and prefers bright, indirect light. This species is popular as a houseplant due to its ease of care and ornamental appeal."
