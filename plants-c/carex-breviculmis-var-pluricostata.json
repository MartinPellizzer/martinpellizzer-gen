    "intro": "Carex breviculmis var. pluricostata, commonly known as the broad-costed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are often reddish-brown in color. This variety is distinguished by its broad, prominently ribbed leaves and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
