    "intro": "Clematis umbraticola, commonly known as the shade-loving clematis, is a climbing vine native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and has finely divided, fern-like leaves that help it capture limited sunlight. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in shaded garden areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is less commonly cultivated than other clematis species."
