    "intro": "Camphoromoea, commonly known as the camphor tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lauraceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly countries like China, India, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves and bark, which contain camphor, a volatile oil used in traditional medicine and perfumery. Camphoromoea species typically grow as evergreen trees or shrubs, with lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers. The wood of these trees is hard and durable, making it valuable for construction and carving."
