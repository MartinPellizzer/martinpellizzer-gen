    "intro": "Calanthe okinawensis f. albiflora, commonly known as the Okinawa white-flowered calanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. This botanical variant is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that contrast with its dark green foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, where it thrives in the undergrowth. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetric, with three sepals and three petals, and the lip is prominently marked. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
