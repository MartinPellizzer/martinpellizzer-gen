    "intro": "Cosentinia vellea nothosubsp. rivas-martinezii, commonly known as the Rivas-Martinez variant of the common cosentinia, is a hybrid plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, pale green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and hybrid origin, it is considered a rare and specialized member of the Apiaceae family."
