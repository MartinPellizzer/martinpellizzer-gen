    "intro": "Carex marianensis, commonly known as the Marian's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, strap-shaped leaves and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which helps in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Carex marianensis is often found in temperate regions of North America and is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
