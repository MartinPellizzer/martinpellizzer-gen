    "intro": "Coelorachis glandulosa var. bandanensis, commonly known as the Bandana fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, strap-like fronds that are often adorned with glandular dots, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in nutrient-poor soils. The Bandana fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
