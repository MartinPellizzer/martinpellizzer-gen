    "intro": "Clitoria tristis, commonly known as the sensitive plant or sorrowful plant, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces vibrant purple or violet pea-like flowers, which are often used in traditional medicine for their purported calming properties. Its roots contain compounds that have been studied for potential pharmacological applications. Clitoria tristis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or cultivated in gardens."
