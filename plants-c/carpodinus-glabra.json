    "intro": "Carpodinus glabra, commonly known as the smooth carpodine, is a small flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its native range."
