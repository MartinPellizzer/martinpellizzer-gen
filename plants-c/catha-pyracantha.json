It is characterized by its thorny branches, elliptical leaves, and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Catha pyracantha is also used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
