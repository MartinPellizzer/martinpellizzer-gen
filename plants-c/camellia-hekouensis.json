    "intro": "Camellia hekouensis, commonly known as the Hekou camellia, is a rare evergreen shrub native to southern China. It belongs to the Theaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and showy, camellia-like flowers. The plant produces waxy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is considered a valuable species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
