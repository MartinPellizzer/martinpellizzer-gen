    "intro": "Cereus viperinus, commonly known as the night bloomer cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its harsh environment. Cereus viperinus is often cultivated for its striking appearance and unique flowering behavior."
