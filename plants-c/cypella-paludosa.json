    "intro": "Cypella paludosa, commonly known as the marsh cypella, is a perennial herb native to wetland environments in temperate regions. It features slender, grass-like leaves that grow in dense tufts, often reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, which bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist soils. Cypella paludosa plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
