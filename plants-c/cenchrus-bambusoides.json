It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
