    "intro": "Carduus valentinus var. albiflorus, commonly known as the whiteflower thistle, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, fluffy, white flower heads that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and ability to attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
