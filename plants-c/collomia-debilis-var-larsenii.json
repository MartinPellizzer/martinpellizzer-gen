    "intro": "Collomia debilis var. larsenii, commonly known as the Sierra larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky habitats, such as slopes and meadows, in regions with moderate to high elevations. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is part of the tribe Polemonieae and is closely related to other larkspur species found in similar environments."
