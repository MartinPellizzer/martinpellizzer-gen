    "intro": "Conospermum filifolium, commonly known as the silky conospermum, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, thread-like leaves that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Conospermum filifolium is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to coastal and dry garden environments."
