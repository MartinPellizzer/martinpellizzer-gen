    "intro": "Cleome jamesonii, commonly known as the spider flower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cleome jamesonii is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun. It is a perennial herb that is relatively easy to grow in gardens with well-drained soil."
