    "intro": "Caldesia oligococca var. acanthocarpa, commonly known as the spiked caldesia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as swamps and marshes. Its leaves are broad and arrow-shaped, often with a waxy surface, while its flowers are small and clustered. This variant is distinguished by its spiky, elongated spadix, which gives it its common name."
