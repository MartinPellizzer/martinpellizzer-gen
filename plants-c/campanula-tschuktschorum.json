It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold environments.
