    "intro": "Chionochloa howensis, commonly known as the Stewart Island hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green blades. The plant typically grows in moist, cool environments, such as stream banks and wetlands, and is adapted to the temperate climate of Stewart Island. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
