    "intro": "Cerastium ruderale, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, hairy leaves that resemble mouse ears. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Cerastium ruderale is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in garden settings for its hardy nature and ability to suppress weeds."
