    "intro": "Carex vulcanica, commonly known as the volcanic sedge, is a perennial plant native to volcanic regions. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, grass-like leaves and spikes of small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or near water sources. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Carex vulcanica is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity in its native habitat."
