It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and knotweeds. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, delicate flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silky hair, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
