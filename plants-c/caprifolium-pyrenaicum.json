    "intro": "Caprifolium pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often tart, and it thrives in well-drained soils in sunny to partially shaded locations. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, while its stems are often covered in fine hairs. Caprifolium pyrenaicum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for pollinators and birds."
