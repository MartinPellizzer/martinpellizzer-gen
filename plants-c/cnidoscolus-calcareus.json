    "intro": "Cnidoscolus calcareus, commonly known as the limestone prickly pear, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces edible fruits that are similar to those of other prickly pear species, though they are often less commonly consumed. Its name refers to the calcareous (limestone-rich) soils in which it thrives. The plant is also notable for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
