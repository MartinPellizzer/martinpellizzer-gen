    "intro": "Chenopodium australe, commonly known as Australian spinach, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and alternate, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by dry, three-angled seed capsules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to arid environments. The leaves are edible and have a mild, spinach-like flavor, often used in traditional cuisines."
