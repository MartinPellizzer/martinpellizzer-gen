    "intro": "Ceratozamia delucana, commonly known as the Mexican cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to southern Mexico. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, Ceratozamia delucana is considered vulnerable to extinction."
