    "intro": "Celastrus rhombifolius, commonly known as the diamond-leafed staff-vine, is a climbing plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, rhombic-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that mature in the fall. Its stems are woody and can grow quite long, allowing it to climb trees and shrubs. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by some Native American tribes."
