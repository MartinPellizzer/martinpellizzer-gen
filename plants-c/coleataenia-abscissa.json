    "intro": "Coleataenia abscissa, commonly known as the broken leaf fern, is a rare and unique fern species characterized by its distinctive foliage. Its fronds are typically divided into segments that appear to be broken or fragmented, giving it a striking, almost abstract appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. It has a delicate, creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread slowly over time. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Coleataenia abscissa is considered a challenging plant to cultivate in non-native settings."
