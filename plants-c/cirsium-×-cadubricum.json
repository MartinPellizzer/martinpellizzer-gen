    "intro": "Cirsium \u00d7 cadubricum, commonly known as the hybrid thistle, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Cirsium vulgare and Cirsium arvense, resulting in a plant with characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is native to Europe. It features spiny leaves and purple or pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain environments."
