    "intro": "Cyperus stuppeus, commonly known as the swamp spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of brownish or reddish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Cyperus stuppeus thrives in saturated soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its dense growth helps stabilize soil and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
