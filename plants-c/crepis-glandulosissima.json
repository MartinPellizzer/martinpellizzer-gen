    "intro": "Crepis glandulosissima, commonly known as the glandular hawk's-beard, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and yellow composite flowers that resemble a cluster of small blooms. Native to Europe and parts of western Asia, this plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It produces small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across suitable environments. The plant's distinctive appearance and ecological adaptations make it a notable species within its native range."
