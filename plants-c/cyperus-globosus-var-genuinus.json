    "intro": "Cyperus globosus var. genuinus, commonly known as the globular flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant features slender, grass-like stems that often form dense clusters, with small, spike-like inflorescences that are usually pale green to brown in color. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly waxy texture, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
