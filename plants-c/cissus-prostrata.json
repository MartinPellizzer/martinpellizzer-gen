    "intro": "Cissus prostrata, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical vine native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, translucent glands. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to some animals. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its ability to climb and spread rapidly makes it both useful and sometimes invasive in certain environments."
