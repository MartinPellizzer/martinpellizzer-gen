    "intro": "Callianassa isabelliana, commonly known as the isabelline ghost shrimp, is a marine decapod crustacean rather than a plant, so it does not have botanical aspects. It is characterized by its translucent, elongated body and is often found in sandy or muddy substrates in coastal areas. The species is named after Isabella, likely in reference to a person or place. It plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to sediment turnover and nutrient cycling. Due to its non-plant nature, it is not studied in botanical contexts."
