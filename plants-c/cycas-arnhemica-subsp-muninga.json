    "intro": "Cycas arnhemica subsp. muninga, commonly known as the Muninga cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to northern Australia. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
