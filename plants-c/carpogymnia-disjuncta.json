    "intro": "Carpogymnia disjuncta, commonly known as the disjunct carpogymnia, is a rare and specialized lichen species belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its unique thallus structure, which consists of a loosely branched, foliose growth with a distinct upper and lower cortex. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with a specific strain of green algae, which contributes to its photosynthetic capabilities. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found on decaying wood in temperate forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
