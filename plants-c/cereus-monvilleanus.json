    "intro": "Cereus monvilleanus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and spiny, ribbed structure. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale pink. These flowers emit a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. It is a popular choice for desert gardens due to its hardy nature and striking floral display."
