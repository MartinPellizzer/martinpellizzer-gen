    "intro": "Carpacoce heteromorpha, commonly known as the irregular carpacoce, is a rare and unusual member of the Pteridaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial fern that exhibits unique morphological features, including its irregularly shaped fronds. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided leaves that often display a distinctive pattern of venation. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions with high humidity. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Carpacoce heteromorpha is considered a valuable subject for botanical study."
