    "intro": "Chorizanthe palmeri var. ventricosa, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has adapted to arid environments with its deep root system and succulent leaves that store water. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is part of the Amaranthaceae family and is often found in sandy or rocky soils in desert regions."
