    "intro": "Centranthera scoparia, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces showy, five-petaled blooms in shades of pink, red, and white, typically during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Centranthera scoparia is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
