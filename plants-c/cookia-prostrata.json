    "intro": "Cookia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate cookia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub that thrives in coastal and sandy environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and arranged in a dense, spreading pattern. Cookia prostrata is often used in coastal landscaping due to its salt tolerance and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
