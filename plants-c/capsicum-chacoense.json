    "intro": "Capsicum chacoense, commonly known as the Chaco pepper or Chaco chili, is a species native to South America, particularly found in Paraguay, Argentina, and Bolivia. It is a herbaceous plant with hairy stems and ovate, slightly pubescent leaves. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that develop into elongated, slender fruits. Its fruits are typically harvested when they are still green, though they can ripen to a red color. Capsicum chacoense is valued for its peppery flavor and is used in traditional cooking and as a spice in various regional cuisines."
