    "intro": "Cyclopogon stenoglossus, commonly known as the narrow-lipped cyclopogon, is a species of flowering plant native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in wet, swampy areas and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive blue-green color. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale blue flowers. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species, requiring conservation efforts to protect its natural environment."
