    "intro": "Coelodiscus lappaceus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are deeply lobed and covered in a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Coelodiscus lappaceus is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in certain regions."
