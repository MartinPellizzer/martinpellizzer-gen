    "intro": "Calycobolus klaineanus, commonly known as the Klainean starflower, is a unique member of the Onagraceae family. It is characterized by its star-shaped, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits called capsules, which contain numerous tiny seeds. Native to the Andes Mountains, it thrives in high-altitude, cool climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
