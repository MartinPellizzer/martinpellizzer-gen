    "intro": "Cerasus canadensis, commonly known as the Canadian cherry or wild cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that are dark red to black when mature. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often developing fissures with age. Cerasus canadensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
