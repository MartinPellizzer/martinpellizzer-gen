    "intro": "Cancellaria senegalensis, commonly known as the Senegalese cancellaria, is a species of sea snail belonging to the family Rissoidae. It is a small, tropical marine gastropod mollusk typically found in sandy or muddy substrates in shallow coastal waters. The shell is usually elongated and has a smooth, glossy surface with a distinct spiral pattern. It plays a role in benthic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling through its feeding habits. The species is primarily distributed in the Atlantic Ocean, particularly around West Africa."
