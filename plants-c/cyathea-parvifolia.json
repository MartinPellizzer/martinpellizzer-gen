    "intro": "Cyathea parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of ferns. Cyathea parvifolia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its slow growth rate and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
