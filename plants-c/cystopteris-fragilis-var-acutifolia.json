    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis var. acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaf brittle fern, is a delicate fern species characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a slender, wiry structure that gives the plant its brittle appearance. It produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves, a feature typical of the fern family. This variety is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in shaded garden settings."
