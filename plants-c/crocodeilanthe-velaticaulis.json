    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe velaticaulis, commonly known as the velvet-stemmed tree fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a dense, velvety layer of spore-bearing leaves. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length, contributing to its dramatic appearance. Its reproductive structures, including the sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
