    "intro": "Chrysodium fluviatile, commonly known as the river chrysanthemum, is a rare aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, yellowish flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant has long, slender stems that float on the water surface, with leaves that are thin and translucent. It plays a role in maintaining water clarity by filtering nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. However, due to habitat destruction, it is now considered endangered in its native range."
