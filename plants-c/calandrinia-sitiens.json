    "intro": "Calandrinia sitiens, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Calandrinia sitiens is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with succulent leaves that store water. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
