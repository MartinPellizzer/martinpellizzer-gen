    "intro": "Carex campylorhina, commonly known as the bent-spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, cylindrical leaves and a dense, spike-like inflorescence. Native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Carex campylorhina is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
