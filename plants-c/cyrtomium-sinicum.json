    "intro": "Cyrtomium sinicum, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a delicate, evergreen fern characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of sori. Native to China, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for various health benefits."
