It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from green to red and yellow. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing seeds.

Due to its attractive foliage, it is popular in horticulture but requires well-drained soil and protection from frost."
