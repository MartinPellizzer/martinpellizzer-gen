    "intro": "Cineraria belbeisia, commonly known as the Canary Island cineraria, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The flowers, which range in color from white to violet, bloom in the spring and attract various pollinators."
