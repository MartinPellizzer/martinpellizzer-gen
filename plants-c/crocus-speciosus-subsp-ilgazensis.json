    "intro": "Crocus speciosus subsp. ilgazensis, commonly known as the Ilgaz crocus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Ilgaz Mountains in Turkey. It is a bulbous perennial herb characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, cup-shaped flowers that are typically 2\u20134 cm in diameter. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to protect its natural environment."
