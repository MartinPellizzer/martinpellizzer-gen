    "intro": "Cardamine flexuosa var. petiolulata, commonly known as the slender watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating on the surface of water. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in shallow, nutrient-rich waters. This variant is distinguished by its shorter petioles compared to the typical form of Cardamine flexuosa."
