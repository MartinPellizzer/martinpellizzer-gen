    "intro": "Corispermum uralense subsp. silvicola, commonly known as the forest corispermum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the taiga and forest-steppe regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that bear small, fleshy, greenish-yellow leaves. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as forest edges and grassy clearings. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its range."
