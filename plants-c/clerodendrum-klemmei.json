    "intro": "Clerodendrum klemmei, commonly known as the red flame cleerodendrum, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces striking clusters of tubular, red or orange-red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant floral display."
