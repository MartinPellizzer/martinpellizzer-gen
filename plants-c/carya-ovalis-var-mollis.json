    "intro": "Carya ovalis var. mollis, commonly known as the smooth hickory, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves that are smooth and often have a slight waxy coating. The tree produces large, edible nuts enclosed in a thick, spiny husk. Its bark is typically gray and furrowed, providing a rugged appearance. This variety is valued for its hard, heavy wood and its role in wildlife habitat and ecological restoration."
