    "intro": "Cyperus declinatus var. limbatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter wide, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in moist soils, making it a common component of aquatic ecosystems. The species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
