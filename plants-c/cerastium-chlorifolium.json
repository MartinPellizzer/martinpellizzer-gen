    "intro": "Cerastium chlorifolium, commonly known as the greenleaf mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, hairy, ovate leaves that are typically a vibrant green, and it produces clusters of tiny white flowers in early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
