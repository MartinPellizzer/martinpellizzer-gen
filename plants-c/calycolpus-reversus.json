    "intro": "Calycolpus reversus, commonly known as the reverse calycolpus, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Myristicaceae, which includes nutmeg and other aromatic tropical plants. The plant is characterized by its distinctive reverse-orientated floral structures, which set it apart from other members of its family. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, Calycolpus reversus is considered a conservation concern."
