    "intro": "Cyclanthera leptostachya, commonly known as the slender-stalked bitter gourd, is a climbing vine belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America and is characterized by its long, slender stems and pale green, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, bitter-tasting fruits. Its fruit is typically 20\u201330 cm long and has a rough, spiny exterior. Cyclanthera leptostachya is often grown for its edible fruit, though it is less commonly cultivated than other bitter gourd species."
