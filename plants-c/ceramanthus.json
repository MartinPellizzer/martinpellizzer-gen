    "intro": "Ceramanthus, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a flowering plant native to Asia. It is characterized by its showy, water-lily-like flowers that bloom in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and red. The plant has a thick, fleshy rhizome that stores nutrients and allows it to survive in aquatic or marshy environments. Its leaves are broad and floating, while its flowers often open at dawn and close at dusk. Ceramanthus has been culturally significant in many Asian traditions, symbolizing purity and spiritual enlightenment."
