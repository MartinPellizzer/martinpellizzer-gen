    "intro": "Celastrus lancifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf staff-vine, is a climbing shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries containing several seeds. Its stems are woody and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adventitious. This species is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties."
