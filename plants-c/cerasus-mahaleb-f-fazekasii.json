    "intro": "Cerasus mahaleb f. fazekasii, commonly known as the cherry laurel, is a cultivar of the Prunus genus characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and fragrant white flowers. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates, preferring well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for hedges, topiaries, and small garden spaces. The leaves remain green throughout the year, providing year-round visual interest in landscapes."
