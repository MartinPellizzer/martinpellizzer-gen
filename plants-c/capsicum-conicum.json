    "intro": "Capsicum conicum, commonly known as the Christmas bell pepper, is a unique and rare species of chili pepper native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped fruits that are typically orange or red in color when mature. The plant is known for its relatively small size and compact growth habit, making it suitable for small gardens or container cultivation. Its flowers are yellow and bilaterally symmetrical, a feature common in many Capsicum species. The fruit's thick walls and high capsaicin content make it a flavorful and spicy addition to culinary dishes."
