    "intro": "Cynodon scabrifolius, commonly known as the roughleaf Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its coarse, serrated leaves and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant thrives in warm climates and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth allows it to spread rapidly and form a dense turf. Cynodon scabrifolius is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in erosion control and forage production."
