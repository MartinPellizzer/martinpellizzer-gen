    "intro": "Cordia chamaedryoides, commonly known as the rock fig or desert fig, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fleshy, reddish or yellowish berries. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils. Cordia chamaedryoides is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food for wildlife."
