    "intro": "Centaurea extrarosularis, commonly known as the narrowleaf starthistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny stems and vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bristly seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as fields and rocky soils. Due to its invasive potential in some areas, it is considered a noxious weed in parts of North America."
