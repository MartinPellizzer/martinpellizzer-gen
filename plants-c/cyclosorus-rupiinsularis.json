    "intro": "Cyclosorus rupiinsularis, commonly known as the island rock liverwort, is a small, cryptogamic plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is typically found on rocky substrates in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a thallus that is often green or yellowish-green, with a distinct, lobed structure. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a simple, undifferentiated body. Cyclosorus rupiinsularis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates in its native environment."
