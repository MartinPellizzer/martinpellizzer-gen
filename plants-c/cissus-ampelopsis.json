    "intro": "Cissus ampelopsis, commonly known as the silver vine, is a trailing perennial vine native to East Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a silvery sheen, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often grown as a decorative plant due to its attractive foliage. Cissus ampelopsis is also valued for its ability to climb and cover trellises or walls."
