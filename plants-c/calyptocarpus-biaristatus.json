    "intro": "Calyptocarpus biaristatus, commonly known as the two-seeded calyptocarp, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen shrub form. The plant has opposite, elliptic leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing two seeds enclosed in a fleshy, persistent calyptra. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically important for conservation efforts in its native region."
