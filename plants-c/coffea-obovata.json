    "intro": "Coffea obovata, commonly known as the Obovate Coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its broad, obovate-shaped leaves and produces small, white flowers that give way to red, fleshy berries containing the seeds used for coffee. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 2 to 3 meters. Due to its ornamental value and potential for coffee production, it is cultivated in some regions for both horticultural and commercial purposes."
