    "intro": "Chenopodium catenulatum, commonly known as red goosefoot, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and fleshy, reddish leaves. The plant produces small, green flowers in clusters and is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. Its succulent leaves and stems make it drought-tolerant, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine. The species is also considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
