    "intro": "Carex sinodissitiflora, commonly known as the Chinese sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and cylindrical spikes of small, greenish flowers. Native to eastern Asia, particularly China, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration and wetland habitats."
