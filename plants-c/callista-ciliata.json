It is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and saline conditions. It has hairy, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Callista ciliata is often found in coastal dunes and is an important component of coastal vegetation."
