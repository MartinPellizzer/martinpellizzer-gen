    "intro": "Codiaeum elegans, commonly known as the flame leaf or croton plant, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful leaves that can range from red, orange, and yellow to shades of green and purple. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its striking foliage rather than its flowers. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its vivid colors. Codiaeum elegans is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its eye-catching appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
