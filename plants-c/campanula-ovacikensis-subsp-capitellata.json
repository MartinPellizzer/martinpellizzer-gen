    "intro": "Campanula ovacikensis subsp. capitellata, commonly known as the Ovacik bellflower, is a rare and endemic species native to Turkey. It is characterized by its bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils in alpine or subalpine regions. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces compact, spherical flower clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
