It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and its profuse display of white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is widely cultivated in arid and Mediterranean climates."
