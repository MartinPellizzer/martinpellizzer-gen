    "intro": "Crocodilodes aristosa, commonly known as the spiny scale fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are covered in small, spiny structures called aristulae, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
