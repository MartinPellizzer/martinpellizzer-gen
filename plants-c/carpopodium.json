    "intro": "Carpopodium, commonly known as a type of green algae, is a colonial organism that forms dense, branching structures. It belongs to the family Ulvaceae and is characterized by its flat, ribbon-like thallus. Carpopodium thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant reproduces through both sexual and asexual means, often producing spores. Its simple structure and rapid growth make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
