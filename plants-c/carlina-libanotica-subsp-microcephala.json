    "intro": "Carlina libanotica subsp. microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed carline thistle, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or dry soils, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features a rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves and produces purple to pink flower heads that resemble thistles. Its flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller, more compact flower heads compared to other Carlina species."
