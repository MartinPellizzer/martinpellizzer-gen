    "intro": "Carex nigra subsp. wiluica, commonly known as black sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers in the summer. The plant thrives in poorly drained soils and is often found in association with other wetland vegetation. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable environments."
