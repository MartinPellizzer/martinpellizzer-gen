    "intro": "Crocus vernus var. lineatus, commonly known as the spotted crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow leaves and showy, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The flowers typically range in color from white to pale yellow, with a prominent, often purple or brown, central blotch. This variety is distinguished by its finely lined or streaked petals, which give it its specific epithet \"lineatus.\" It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings."
