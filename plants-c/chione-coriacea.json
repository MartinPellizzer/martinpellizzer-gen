    "intro": "Chione coriacea, commonly known as the rough rockcress, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant is characterized by its dense, hairy leaves and clustered inflorescences that produce yellow or white flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Chione coriacea is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
