    "intro": "Cochemiea albicans, commonly known as the white cochemiea, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white to pale green foliage, which provides insulation against extreme temperatures. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking contrast to its fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
