    "intro": "Cheilanthes dichotoma, commonly known as the forked rock fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in arid and rocky environments. The plant has feather-like fronds that are typically divided into two main branches, giving it its common name. It possesses a robust rhizome system that allows it to store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in dry conditions. Cheilanthes dichotoma is often found growing on limestone or sandstone in open, sunny habitats."
