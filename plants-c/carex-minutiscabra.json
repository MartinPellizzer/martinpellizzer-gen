    "intro": "Carex minutiscabra, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively. Carex minutiscabra is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
