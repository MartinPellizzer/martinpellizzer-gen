    "intro": "Ceanothus tomentosus var. tomentosus, commonly known as the wooly ceanothus, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces clusters of blue or purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Its aromatic leaves and showy blooms make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
