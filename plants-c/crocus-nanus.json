    "intro": "Crocus nanus, commonly known as the dwarf crocus, is a small, bulbous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with delicate, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant produces its flowers in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and the blooms are often accompanied by a pleasant, sweet fragrance. Its bulbs are adapted to thrive in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Crocus nanus is also known for its ability to naturalize over time, creating clusters of flowers in subsequent years."
