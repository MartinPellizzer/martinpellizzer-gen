    "intro": "Centropogon cornutus f. leucostomus, commonly known as the white-stemmed grassvetch, is a variant of the grassvetch species native to certain regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, often whitish stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically borne on slender, ascending branches. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
