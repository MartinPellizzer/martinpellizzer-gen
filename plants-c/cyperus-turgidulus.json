It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, three-parted flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Cyperus turgidulus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
