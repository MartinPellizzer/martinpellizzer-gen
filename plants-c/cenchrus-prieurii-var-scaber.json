    "intro": "Cenchrus prieurii var. scaber, commonly known as roughhair grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its robust, tufted growth habit and wiry, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences with small, spikelet-based flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low rainfall and poor soil conditions. Its hardy nature makes it useful for erosion control and as a forage plant in drought-prone areas."
