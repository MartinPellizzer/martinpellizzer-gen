    "intro": "Crinum lorifolium, commonly known as the broad-leafed lily, is a striking perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features tall, narrow leaves with broad, lance-shaped blades that contribute to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, fragrant white or pale pink flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer to early fall. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in wet or moist soils. Crinum lorifolium is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, where it thrives in humid, sunny conditions."
