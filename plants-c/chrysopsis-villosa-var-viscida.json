    "intro": "Chrysopsis villosa var. viscida, commonly known as the woolly goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and disturbed areas. Its hairy stems and leaves provide a protective layer against water loss, adapting it to harsh, dry conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance."
