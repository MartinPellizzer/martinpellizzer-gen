    "intro": "Cardamine flexuosa var. scutata, commonly known as the scutate watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features slender, branching stems that often grow close to the ground, with alternate, trifoliate leaves that have a distinctive, scalloped edge. The small, white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early spring, followed by kidney-shaped, glossy seeds. This variety is closely related to other members of the Ranunculaceae family, sharing similar botanical traits such as the presence of calcium oxalate crystals in its tissues. It is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and along the edges of wooded areas where the soil remains consistently damp."
