    "intro": "Cyclosorus pumilis, commonly known as the small cyclosorus, is a small, aquatic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Cyclosorus pumilis is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value and ability to create a lush, green carpet in water features."
