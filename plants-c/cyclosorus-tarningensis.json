    "intro": "Cyclosorus tarningensis, commonly known as the Tarninges moss, is a rare and specialized liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with small, overlapping leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, waxy secretions. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are embedded within the thallus and release spores under favorable conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Cyclosorus tarningensis is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental quality."
