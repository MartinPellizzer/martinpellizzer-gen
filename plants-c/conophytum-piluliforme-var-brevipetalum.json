    "intro": "Conophytum piluliforme var. brevipetalum, commonly known as the \"bottle plant\" or \"cork plant,\" is a succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rounded stems that resemble small bottles or corks, which store water to help it survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, fleshy leaves that are typically green or reddish in color, depending on light exposure. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange and appear in the spring. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
