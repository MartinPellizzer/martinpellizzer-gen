    "intro": "Cleretum lyratifolium, commonly known as the lyrate-leaved cleretum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, lyre-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
