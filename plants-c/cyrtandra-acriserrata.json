It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often clustered in inflorescences at the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and is often found in areas with rich, well-drained soil.
