    "intro": "Cyanotis paludosa subsp. bulbifera, commonly known as the marsh bluebell, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The subspecies is notable for its ability to produce bulb-like structures, which serve as storage organs and aid in vegetative propagation. These bulbs allow the plant to survive in waterlogged soils and regenerate after flooding. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical research."
