    "intro": "Cynorkis lilacina subsp. curvicalcar, commonly known as the curving-spurred orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to specific regions in South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically display a mix of pink and white hues. The plant produces a single, upright stem with few leaves and a cluster of small, spurred flowers. Its unique floral structure, particularly the curved spur, is an adaptation for pollination by specific insect species. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings."
