It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in arid and semi-arid climates."
