    "intro": "Caulotretus, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical Africa. These plants are characterized by their rosettes of fleshy, often velvety leaves and their showy, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of purple, pink, and white. The leaves are typically thick and succulent, adapted to store water in arid environments. Caulotretus species are popular as houseplants due to their compact size and ability to thrive in indoor conditions. They are also valued for their ornamental appeal and ease of care."
