    "intro": "Cardaminopsis arenosa subsp. petrogena, commonly known as the sand saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments in Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, basal leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are often lobed and have a distinctive, wrinkled texture. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides nectar for pollinators."
