It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are smooth to the touch. The plant produces panicle-like inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
