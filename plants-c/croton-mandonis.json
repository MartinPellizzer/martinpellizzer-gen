    "intro": "Croton mandonis, commonly known as the velvetleaf croton, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically large and deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, spiny capsules that contain its seeds. Croton mandonis is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage. However, it can be invasive in some regions and may pose a challenge in ecological management."
