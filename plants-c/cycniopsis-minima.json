    "intro": "Cycniopsis minima, commonly known as the small cycnium, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands or stream banks. The plant produces small, round fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts upon maturity. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, with three leaflets that are narrow and pointed. Cycniopsis minima is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
