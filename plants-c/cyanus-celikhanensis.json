    "intro": "Cyanus celikhanensis, commonly known as the Celikhan's blueweed, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous tiny florets. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers, which are typically arranged in a single head at the end of each stem. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
