    "intro": "Cochemiea conoidea, commonly known as the conical cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, spiny stems that form a dense, shrub-like structure. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. Cochemiea conoidea is a succulent plant, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in arid environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and unique appearance."
