    "intro": "Centaurea subarachnoidea, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and spiny, leaf-like bracts that surround the inflorescence. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration. Centaurea subarachnoidea is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
