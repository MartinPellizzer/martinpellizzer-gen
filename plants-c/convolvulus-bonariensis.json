    "intro": "Convolvulus bonariensis, commonly known as the common morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is native to South America and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue, purple, or white, opening in the morning and closing by midday. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental vines. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in some regions."
