    "intro": "Ceratochloa simplex, commonly known as the slender grass or small-leaved grass, is a species of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are arranged in panicles. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Ceratochloa simplex is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
