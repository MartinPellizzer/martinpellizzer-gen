    "intro": "Cirsium vergelense, commonly known as the Vergel's thistle, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in sunny environments. The plant is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and large, serrated leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers, which appear in late summer, are purple or pink and are arranged in a dense, spherical head. Cirsium vergelense is often found in grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
