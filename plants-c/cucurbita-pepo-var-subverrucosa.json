    "intro": "Cucurbita pepo var. subverrucosa, commonly known as the rough-fruited pumpkin, is a variety of the common gourd species. It is characterized by its thick, ridged, and often hairy stems, which provide structural support and aid in water retention. The leaves are typically large, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its fruits are usually round or oval, with a thick, warty rind that ranges in color from pale yellow to deep orange. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional cooking in some regions."
