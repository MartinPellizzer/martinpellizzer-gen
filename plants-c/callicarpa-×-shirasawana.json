    "intro": "Callicarpa \u00d7 shirasawana, commonly known as the Japanese beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Callicarpa cathayana and Callicarpa japonica. The plant is characterized by its clusters of vibrant purple berries that appear in the fall, making it a popular ornamental plant. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, turning red in the autumn. The berries are not only visually striking but also attract birds and other wildlife, contributing to its ecological value."
