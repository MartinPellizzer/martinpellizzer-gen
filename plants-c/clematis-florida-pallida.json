    "intro": "Clematis florida pallida, commonly known as the pale-flowered clematis, is a species native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous vine characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers in early spring, which are often described as delicate and fragrant. Its botanical features include compound leaves with three to five leaflets and a fibrous root system that helps it anchor to supporting structures. Clematis florida pallida thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
