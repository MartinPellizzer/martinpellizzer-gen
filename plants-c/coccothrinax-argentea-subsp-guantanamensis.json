    "intro": "Coccothrinax argentea subsp. guantanamensis, commonly known as the Guant\u00e1namo silver palm, is a rare and endemic species native to Cuba. It is a small, slow-growing palm characterized by its slender trunk and pinnate leaves with a silvery-blue hue. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellow flowers, followed by black, spherical fruits. It thrives in coastal areas with well-drained soils and is adapted to saline and humid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
