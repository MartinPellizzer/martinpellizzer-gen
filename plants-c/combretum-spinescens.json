    "intro": "Combretum spinescens, commonly known as the spiny bushwillow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought, it is a common component of the local flora."
