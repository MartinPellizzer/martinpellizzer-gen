    "intro": "Cyclosorus guadalupensis, commonly known as the Guadalupe cyclosorus, is a rare and unique fern native to the rocky habitats of the Guadalupe Island in the Pacific Ocean. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds with a dense, overlapping structure. The plant exhibits a creeping growth habit, with rhizomes that help it anchor to rocky substrates and absorb moisture from the environment. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclosorus guadalupensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
