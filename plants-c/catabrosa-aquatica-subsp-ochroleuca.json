    "intro": "Catabrosa aquatica subsp. ochroleuca, commonly known as the yellow water-plantain, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, usually greenish-yellow in color. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and waterfowl."
