    "intro": "Cyanea longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered Cyanea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Campanulaceae. It is native to the Hawaiian Islands and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forests and rocky slopes. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, elongated fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyanea longiflora is considered a vulnerable species."
