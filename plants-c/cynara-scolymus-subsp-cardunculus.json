It is characterized by its large, spiny leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often growing in arid or semi-arid environments. It is cultivated for its edible stems and leaves, though it requires careful preparation due to its prickly texture.
