    "intro": "Cercidium unijugum, commonly known as the single-jugate creosote bush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, resinous foliage and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, woody pods containing seeds. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soils and extreme temperatures. Cercidium unijugum plays an important ecological role in desert ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
