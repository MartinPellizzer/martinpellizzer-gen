    "intro": "Carex amplectens, commonly known as the broadleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves that are typically broader than those of true grasses, with a distinct central stem. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish or brownish flowers, which are typical of sedges. Carex amplectens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
