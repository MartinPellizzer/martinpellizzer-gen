    "intro": "Centrosema macranthum, commonly known as large-flowered centrosema, is a leguminous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is often found in wetland habitats and is adapted to thrive in moist, acidic soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Centrosema macranthum is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
