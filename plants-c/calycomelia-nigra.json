It is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with woody stems and small, elliptical leaves. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters and are known for their strong, distinctive fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calycomelia nigra is considered a species of conservation concern."
