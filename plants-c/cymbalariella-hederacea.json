It is a thalloid liverwort, characterized by its flat, ribbon-like structure that grows close to the ground. This plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and damp soils. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia. Cymbalariella hederacea plays an important role in ecological systems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms."
