    "intro": "Cyclostachya stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping cyclostachya, is a low-growing perennial plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender,\u530d\u5310\u7684 stems that spread along the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically greenish or pale yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its stoloniferous growth pattern allows it to colonize new areas efficiently, making it a common sight in humid tropical regions."
