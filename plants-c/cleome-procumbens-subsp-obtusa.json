    "intro": "Cleome procumbens subsp. obtusa, commonly known as the broadleaf cleome, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, branching stems that lie close to the ground, often forming a mat-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow, cruciform flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a slightly hairy surface. It is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
