    "intro": "Carex aureolensis, commonly known as the golden sedge, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that often exhibits a golden hue, especially in the sun-exposed areas. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Carex aureolensis is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
