    "intro": "Cryptoloma anonymum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer, often in clusters. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the humid air. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Cryptoloma anonymum is considered critically endangered."
