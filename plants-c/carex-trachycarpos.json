    "intro": "Carex trachycarpos, commonly known as rough-skinned sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its stiff, triangular stems and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and stream sides. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland environments."
