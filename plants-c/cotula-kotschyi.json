    "intro": "Cotula kotschyi, commonly known as the Desert Daisy, is a small, flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant produces yellow ray flowers surrounded by a cluster of tiny, white to pale yellow disk flowers. Cotula kotschyi is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with succulent leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. It is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in drought-tolerant gardens."
