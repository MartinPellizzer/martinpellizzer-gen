    "intro": "Cyperus punctatus, commonly known as the spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are narrow and typically have a waxy coating. Cyperus punctatus produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are usually clustered at the tips of the stems. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
