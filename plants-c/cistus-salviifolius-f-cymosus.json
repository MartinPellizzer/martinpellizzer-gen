It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Its aromatic foliage and showy blooms make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
