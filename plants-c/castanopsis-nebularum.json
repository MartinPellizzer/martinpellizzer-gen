    "intro": "Castanopsis nebularum, commonly known as the cloud umbrella oak, is a species of evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts, and is characterized by its hard, durable wood. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a woody cupule. Its leaves are leathery and alternate, with a glossy surface that helps reduce water loss in its humid, high-altitude habitat. Castanopsis nebularum plays an important ecological role in its native forests, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
