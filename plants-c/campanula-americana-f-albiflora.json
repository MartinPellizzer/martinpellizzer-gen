It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. This variety is appreciated for its ornamental value and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
