    "intro": "Cassia orbiculata var. trichothyrsus, commonly known as the golden flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces bright yellow inflorescences that resemble torches, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to various soil types."
