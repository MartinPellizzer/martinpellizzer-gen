    "intro": "Centrosema fulgens, commonly known as the flame bean, is a tropical legume native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking red to orange flowers, which are typically clustered in racemes. The plant has trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in agroforestry systems for its nitrogen-fixing abilities. Centrosema fulgens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and potential as a forage crop."
