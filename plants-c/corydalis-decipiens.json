    "intro": "Corydalis decipiens, commonly known as the \"false cowslip,\" is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs and produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are alternate along the stem. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive hooded structure that resembles a cowslip, hence its common name. Corydalis decipiens is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky habitats, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
