    "intro": "Chamaecrista andromedea, commonly known as the coastal senna, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or calcareous soils, often along the edges of dunes or in maritime hammocks. The plant produces bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments. Chamaecrista andromedea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
