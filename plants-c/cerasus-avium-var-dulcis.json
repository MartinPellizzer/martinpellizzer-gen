    "intro": "Cerasus avium var. dulcis, commonly known as the sweet cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy in appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by the development of sweet, fleshy fruits. The fruit, or cherry, is typically red or dark red when ripe and contains a single seed. This variety is widely cultivated for its edible fruits, which are valued for their flavor and use in both fresh consumption and culinary applications."
