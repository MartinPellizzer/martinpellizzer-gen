    "intro": "Cuscuta epithymum f. alba, commonly known as white dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, white, spherical flowers that are often clustered together, and its stems are slender and yellowish in color. The plant is native to various regions in Europe and Asia and is commonly found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. It has a short life cycle, with seeds dispersed by wind or animals, and it can be invasive in certain ecosystems. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plants and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
