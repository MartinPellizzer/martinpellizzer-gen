It is characterized by its hairy stems and oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Conyza ovata is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize various habitats, making it both a weed and a potential indicator of soil disturbance."
