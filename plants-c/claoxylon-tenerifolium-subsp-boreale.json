    "intro": "Claoxylon tenerifolium subsp. boreale, commonly known as the Canary Island cypress, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, feather-like foliage that forms a cylindrical shape. The plant has scale-like leaves that are closely arranged along the branches, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a humid, temperate climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
