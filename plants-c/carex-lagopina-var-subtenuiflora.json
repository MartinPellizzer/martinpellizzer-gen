    "intro": "Carex lagopina var. subtenuiflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of eastern North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known for their rhizomatous growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil in wetland environments. The inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-ranked spikelets, typical of the sedge genus Carex."
