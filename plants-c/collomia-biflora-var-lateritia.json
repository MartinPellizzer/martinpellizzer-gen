    "intro": "Collomia biflora var. lateritia, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky slopes. The plant features small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The species is adapted to withstand drought and temperature extremes, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
