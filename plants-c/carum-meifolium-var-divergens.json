    "intro": "Carum meifolium var. divergens, commonly known as the divergent meadow caraway, is a perennial herb native to certain regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, aromatic leaves with a distinct caraway-like scent. Its flowers are white or pale blue, arranged in umbels, and it produces small, oval seeds. This variant is characterized by its diverging leaf patterns, which distinguish it from other caraway species."
