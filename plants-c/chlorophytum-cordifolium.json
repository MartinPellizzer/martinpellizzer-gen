It features long, narrow leaves that are typically green with white or silver markings, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. It produces small, greenish-white flowers on tall stalks, which are often followed by clusters of small, white berries. Chlorophytum cordifolium is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
