    "intro": "Coursetia robinioides, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, leathery, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged in clusters. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring, which are clustered in inflorescences at the ends of the branches. Its root system is deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. Coursetia robinioides is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
