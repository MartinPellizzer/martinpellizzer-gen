It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, thriving in shallow water or saturated soil. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, greenish flowers, which are often inconspicuous compared to other Cyperus species. This variant is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
