It is characterized by its woody stems and small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that are often followed by edible, acidic fruits. It is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important component of the flora in the Atacama Desert."
