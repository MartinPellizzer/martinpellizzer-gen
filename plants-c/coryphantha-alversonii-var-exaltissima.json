    "intro": "Coryphantha alversonii var. exaltissima, commonly known as the tall golden barrel cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can reach heights of up to 6 feet. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne in clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. This cactus is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and striking appearance."
