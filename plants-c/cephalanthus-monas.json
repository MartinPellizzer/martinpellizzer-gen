    "intro": "Cephalanthus monas, commonly known as the red root dogwood, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its roots are deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Cephalanthus monas is often found in moist, sunny areas such as stream banks and woodland edges."
