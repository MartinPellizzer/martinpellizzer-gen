It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces showy, daisy-like yellow flowers with a dark central disk, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often arranged in a basal rosette, and the plant is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soils. It is often found in open woods, prairies, and along roadsides, where it thrives in disturbed or sunny habitats."
