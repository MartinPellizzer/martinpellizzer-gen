    "intro": "Convolvulus mollis f. amplexicaulis, commonly known as the creeping yellow woodrush, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. It is well adapted to arid conditions and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
