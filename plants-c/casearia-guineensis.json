    "intro": "Casearia guineensis, commonly known as African snowberry, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Salicaceae and is characterized by its small, white, clustered flowers. The plant produces bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions for its attractive foliage and unique fruit."
