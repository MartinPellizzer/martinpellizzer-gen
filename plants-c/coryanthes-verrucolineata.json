    "intro": "Coryanthes verrucolineata, commonly known as the warty coryanthes, is a tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive warty texture on the labellum. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its flowers are specialized for pollination by flies, which are attracted by the strong odor resembling decaying flesh. The species is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
