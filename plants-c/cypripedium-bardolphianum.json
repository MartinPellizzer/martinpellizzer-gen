    "intro": "Cypripedium bardolphianum, commonly known as the Bardolph lady's tresses, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and a tall, slender stem that bears a cluster of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing intricate, fragrant blossoms that resemble a tresses of hair. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing in shaded forest understories. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as an endangered species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
