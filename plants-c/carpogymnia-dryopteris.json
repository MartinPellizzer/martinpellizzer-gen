    "intro": "Carpogymnia dryopteris, commonly known as the fern moss, is a small, perennial bryophyte that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, clustered growth habit. The plant features a dense mat of leafy shoots with small, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a layer of hair. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature. Carpogymnia dryopteris is often found in forest floors and rocky crevices, contributing to soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat."
