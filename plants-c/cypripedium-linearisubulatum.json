    "intro": "Cypripedium linearisubulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, pouch-like lip that is often brightly colored, typically in shades of pink or yellow. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears a few showy flowers, each with a distinct, intricate structure. Its leaves are linear and often clustered at the base, contributing to its overall elegant appearance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this species is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
