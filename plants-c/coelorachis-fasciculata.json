    "intro": "Coelorachis fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered spikegrass, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, fasciculate (bundled) growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Coelorachis fasciculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
