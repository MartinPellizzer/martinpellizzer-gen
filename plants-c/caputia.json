    "intro": "Caputia, commonly known as the \"cup plant,\" is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces a distinctive cup-like structure at the top of its stem, which holds rainwater, aiding in its survival during dry periods. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in yellow to orange hues. Caputia is often found in moist soils along streambanks and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
