    "intro": "Coffea jasminoides var. trillesiana, commonly known as the jasmine coffee or trillesian coffee, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the Coffea genus. It is characterized by its fragrant, jasmine-like flowers and small, dark green leaves. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Vietnam and Laos. It produces small, red berries that contain the coffee beans used for brewing. Due to its limited distribution and unique aroma, it is highly valued by specialty coffee growers and botanists alike."
