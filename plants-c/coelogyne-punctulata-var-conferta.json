    "intro": "Coelogyne punctulata var. conferta, commonly known as the clustered coelogyne, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of clustered pseudobulbs, which are short, thick stems that store water and nutrients. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a yellow throat, during the late winter to early spring season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
