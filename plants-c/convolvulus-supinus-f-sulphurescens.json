    "intro": "Convolvulus supinus f. sulphurescens, commonly known as the sulphur-flowered morning glory, is a rare and distinctive variant of the convolvulus genus. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange to reddish flowers, which are often more vibrant than those of the typical species. The plant is a trailing or climbing annual herb with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. It thrives in disturbed soils and sunny conditions, often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its unique floral coloration makes it a subject of interest in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
