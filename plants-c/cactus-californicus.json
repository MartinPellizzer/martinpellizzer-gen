    "intro": "Cactus californicus, commonly known as the California barrel cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Its spines are typically white to yellow and serve as protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. It plays an important ecological role in desert ecosystems by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
