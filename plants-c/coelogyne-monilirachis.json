    "intro": "Coelogyne monilirachis, commonly known as the chain orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte on trees, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are strap-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Coelogyne monilirachis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
