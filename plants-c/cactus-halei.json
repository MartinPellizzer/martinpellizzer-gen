    "intro": "Cactus halei, commonly known as the Hale's cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a spineless cactus that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to extreme desert conditions. The plant features a rounded stem with a thick, waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers, which are usually yellow or orange, bloom in late spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cactus halei is valued for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
