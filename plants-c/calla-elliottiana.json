    "intro": "Calla elliottiana, commonly known as the Elliott's calla, is a striking herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features a distinctive spathe, a large, white, petal-like leaf that encloses the small, yellowish spathulate flower. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant. The Elliott's calla is noted for its ability to bloom reliably in cooler climates, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking vibrant, seasonal color."
