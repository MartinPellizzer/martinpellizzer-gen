    "intro": "Couratari asterophora, commonly known as the star-leaf couratari, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lecythidaceae. It is native to the tropical rainforests of South America, particularly in Brazil, Peru, and Colombia. The plant is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves that often have a distinctive star-shaped pattern on the underside. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in yellow or greenish-white hues. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems."
