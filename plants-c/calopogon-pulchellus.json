It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its striking pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and swamps. Its flowers are arranged in a dense spike and are pollinated by insects, particularly bees. Calopogon pulchellus is a rare and endangered species, requiring specific habitat conditions to thrive."
