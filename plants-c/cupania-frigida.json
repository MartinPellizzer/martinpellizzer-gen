    "intro": "Cupania frigida, commonly known as the Arctic buckthorn, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and produces tiny, blue-black berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. The plant thrives in harsh, cold environments and is adapted to permafrost conditions. Its botanical features include a woody stem and a system of roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Cupania frigida plays a crucial role in the ecological balance of its native habitats."
