    "intro": "Cephalophyllum latipetalum, commonly known as the broad-petaled headplant, is a striking succulent native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a bold visual contrast to its foliage. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Cephalophyllum latipetalum is adapted to dry conditions, making it drought-tolerant and relatively low maintenance."
