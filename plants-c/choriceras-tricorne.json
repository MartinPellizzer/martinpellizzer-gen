    "intro": "Choriceras tricorne, commonly known as the tricorne horned lichen, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Cladoniaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, branched thallus with a central stem and lateral branches that often form a tricorne or three-lobed shape. The lichen typically grows on tree trunks and branches in temperate and subpolar regions. It is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a fungal partner and a green alga or cyanobacterium. Its morphology and growth patterns make it an important indicator species for assessing air quality and ecological health."
