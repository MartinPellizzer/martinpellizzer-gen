    "intro": "Cardamine scaposa, commonly known as slender watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, woodland environments. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped with a waxy surface. The plant produces a single, upright flowering stem that bears small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a cluster. Its leaves and stems are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. Cardamine scaposa thrives in shaded, damp habitats and is often found in streamside areas and forest floors."
