    "intro": "Colubrina excelsa, commonly known as the tall beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers in the spring, which are followed by showy, violet-purple berries in the fall. These berries are a food source for various birds and mammals. Colubrina excelsa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
