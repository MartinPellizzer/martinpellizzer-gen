    "intro": "Conophytum tabulare, commonly known as the \"stone plant,\" is a succulent native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped growth pattern. The plant features fleshy, triangular leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. Conophytum tabulare is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
