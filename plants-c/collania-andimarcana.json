    "intro": "Collania andimarcana, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires a cool, moist environment to thrive. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the thin, nutrient-poor soil of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Collania andimarcana is considered a vulnerable species."
