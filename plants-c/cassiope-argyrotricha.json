    "intro": "Cassiope argyrotricha, commonly known as the silver-tipped cassiope, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the rocky coastal regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking combination of silver-white and dark green foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Cassiope argyrotricha is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh coastal environments."
