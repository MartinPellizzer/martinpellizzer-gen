It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, making it a dioecious species. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
