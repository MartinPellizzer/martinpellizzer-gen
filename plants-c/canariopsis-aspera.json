    "intro": "Canariopsis aspera, commonly known as the rough canarygrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has erect, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, and its leaves are narrow with a rough, sandpapery texture. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, bract-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Canariopsis aspera plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
