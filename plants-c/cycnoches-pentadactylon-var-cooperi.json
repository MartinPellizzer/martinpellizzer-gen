    "intro": "Cycnoches pentadactylon var. cooperi, commonly known as the Cooper's cycnoches, is a rare and striking orchid native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, grass-like leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowering period occurs during the late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern."
