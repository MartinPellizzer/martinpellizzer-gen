    "intro": "Cladocarpa herbstii, commonly known as the Herbst's cliffbranched maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, branched, and often twisted stems, which are covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, winged fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
