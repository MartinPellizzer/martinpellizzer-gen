    "intro": "Carex rostrata subsp. utriculata, commonly known as the bladderleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream edges. Its distinctive feature is the presence of bladder-like structures on the lower part of the stems, which are specialized for water storage. This subspecies is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability to aquatic environments."
