    "intro": "Campylanthus salsoloides var. leucantha, commonly known as silverleaf campylanthus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to drought and high sunlight exposure, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
