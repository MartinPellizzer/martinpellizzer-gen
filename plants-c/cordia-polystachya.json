    "intro": "Cordia polystachya, commonly known as the red mangrove or mangrove cordia, is a tropical tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for various bird and animal species. Its roots often form dense networks that help stabilize shorelines and prevent erosion. Cordia polystachya is well adapted to saline and waterlogged soils, making it a key species in mangrove ecosystems."
