It features compact, dense clusters of fleshy, blue-green leaves that form a rosette shape. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
