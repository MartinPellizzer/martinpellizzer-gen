    "intro": "Crotalaria pilosa var. riparia, commonly known as the river crotalaria, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and pairs of opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive, spiny pod that splits open when mature to release the seeds. This species is often found growing along riverbanks and in moist, sandy soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
