It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
