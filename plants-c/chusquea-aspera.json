    "intro": "Chusquea aspera, commonly known as the rough bamboo, is a species of grass-like plant belonging to the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in countries like Peru and Bolivia. This plant is characterized by its tall, stiff, and often spiny culms, which can grow up to several meters in height. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in a rough, textured surface, contributing to its common name. Chusquea aspera is often found in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
