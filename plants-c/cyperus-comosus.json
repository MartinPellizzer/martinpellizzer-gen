    "intro": "Cyperus comosus, commonly known as the tussock sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often forming dense clumps with a rosette of leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats. Cyperus comosus is also used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant in water gardens."
