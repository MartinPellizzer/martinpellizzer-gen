    "intro": "Crataegus pseudomelanocarpa, commonly known as the blackthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches and small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed soils, thriving in partial to full sun. Its flowers are white or pink, appearing in early spring before the leaves, and it produces aromatic, edible fruits that are a food source for birds and mammals. The species is valued for its ecological role and historical use in traditional medicine."
