    "intro": "Centaurea granatensis, commonly known as Granada star-thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and purple-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or disturbed soils. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is considered a weed in agricultural areas."
