    "intro": "Coffea canephora var. kouilouensis, commonly known as Kouilouensis coffee, is a variant of the robusta coffee species native to Central Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and produces small, oval-shaped red berries containing two seeds. The plant thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is typically grown at lower altitudes and is known for its robust flavor profile. Due to its limited cultivation, it is less common in global coffee markets compared to other varieties."
