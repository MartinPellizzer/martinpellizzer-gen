It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, oval-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions, where it contributes to forest ecosystems. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
