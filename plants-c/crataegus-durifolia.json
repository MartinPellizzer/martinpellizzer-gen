It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white to pinkish flowers in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the bark is smooth and grayish in color. Crataegus durifolia is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks, thriving in a variety of soil types."
