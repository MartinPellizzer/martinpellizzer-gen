    "intro": "Clermontia coerulea var. parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its small, tubular blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or clay soils. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine, white pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
