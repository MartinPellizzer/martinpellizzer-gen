    "intro": "Carpinus insularis, commonly known as the island hornbeam, is a small deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters and has a rounded crown with dense, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, chestnut-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
