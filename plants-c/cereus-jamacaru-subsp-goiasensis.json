    "intro": "Cereus jamacaru subsp. goiasensis, commonly known as the Goi\u00e1s Cereus, is a cacti species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom at night, a trait common among many cacti species. Its stems are covered in sparse, straight spines, and it is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. This subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal flowering habit."
