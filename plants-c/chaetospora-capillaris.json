It is characterized by its finely branched, hair-like structures that give it a silky appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are linear and often have a distinct midrib, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Chaetospora capillaris plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
