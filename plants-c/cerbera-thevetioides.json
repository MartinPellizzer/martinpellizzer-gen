It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, featuring thick, often gnarled bark. The plant produces clusters of white, waxy flowers that resemble snowballs, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds."
