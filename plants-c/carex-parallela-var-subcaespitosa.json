    "intro": "Carex parallela var. subcaespitosa, commonly known as the tufted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, making it a useful plant for erosion control in wetland habitats."
