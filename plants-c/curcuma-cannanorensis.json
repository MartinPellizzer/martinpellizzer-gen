    "intro": "Curcuma cannanorensis, commonly known as the Kozhikode turmeric, is a perennial herb native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces large, ornamental leaves and yellow-orange inflorescences, which are often used in traditional floral arrangements. Its rhizomes are valued for their culinary and medicinal properties, similar to other turmeric species. However, it is less commonly cultivated commercially compared to other curcuma varieties."
