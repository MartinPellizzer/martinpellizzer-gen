    "intro": "Centropogon cumulatus, commonly known as the cloud spike, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in coastal areas and wetlands. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is considered rare in the wild."
