    "intro": "Calystegia sepium var. repens, commonly known as creeping morning glory, is a sprawling vine native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and can grow up to 10 cm in size. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pale blue or violet, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rapid growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, often forming dense mats over the ground. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, kidney-shaped seeds."
