    "intro": "Cremastosperma peruvianum, commonly known as the Peruvian burr, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Peru. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiny pod, which helps in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals. Cremastosperma peruvianum is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions."
