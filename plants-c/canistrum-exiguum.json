    "intro": "Canistrum exiguum, commonly known as the small-leaf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees such as ceiba and mahogany. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its fruits are small berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health of its host tree if left unchecked."
