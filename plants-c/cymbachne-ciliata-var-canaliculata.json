    "intro": "Cymbachne ciliata var. canaliculata, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed cymbachne, is a grass species native to certain regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with finely toothed margins. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. This variant is distinguished by its slightly grooved or canaliculated leaf blades, giving it its specific epithet."
