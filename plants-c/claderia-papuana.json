It belongs to the family Cladoniaceae and is characterized by its thalloid structure, which consists of a flat, leaf-like body. The plant exhibits a complex system of lobes and branches, which aid in its photosynthetic processes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or soil. Claderia papuana plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
