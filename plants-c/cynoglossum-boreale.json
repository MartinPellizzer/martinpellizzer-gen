    "intro": "Cynoglossum boreale, commonly known as the northern mouse-ear, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It features a basal rosette of rounded, hairy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence. The plant produces small, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Cynoglossum boreale is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local insect populations."
