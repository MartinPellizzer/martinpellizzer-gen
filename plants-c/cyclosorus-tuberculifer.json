    "intro": "Cyclosorus tuberculifer, commonly known as the warty liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its small, lobed thallus that often forms dense mats on moist, shaded surfaces. The plant features distinctive tuberculate (wart-like) structures on its leaves, which give it its common name. It thrives in humid environments, typically found in temperate regions near streams or in shaded forest floors. Cyclosorus tuberculifer plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
