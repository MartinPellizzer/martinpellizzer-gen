    "intro": "Cranichis fendleri, commonly known as the Mexican orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is a small orchid with delicate, pale green to white flowers that bloom during the spring season. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short, upright stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
