    "intro": "Carex umbellata subsp. brachyrhina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and three-ranked leaves. The plant produces compact, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of riparian and wetland ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in these habitats."
