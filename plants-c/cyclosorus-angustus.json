    "intro": "Cyclosorus angustus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water clover, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to float on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically borne on short stalks above the water. It thrives in nutrient-rich, shallow waters and is often found in ponds, lakes, and slow streams. Cyclosorus angustus plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
