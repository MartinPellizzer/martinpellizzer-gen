    "intro": "Carex fusca var. intricata, commonly known as the intricately branched sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshy areas, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its intricate leaf patterns and ability to stabilize soil make it an ecologically valuable plant in wetland habitats."
