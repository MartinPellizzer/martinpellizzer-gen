    "intro": "Caryotophora skiatophytoides, commonly known as the golden ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family. It is characterized by its delicate, pale yellow flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to capture limited light in its low-light habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Caryotophora skiatophytoides is considered a highly specialized and endangered species."
