    "intro": "Carex erebus, commonly known as the dark sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and stiff, growing in dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as bogs and marshes, and is often found in shaded areas. Carex erebus plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
