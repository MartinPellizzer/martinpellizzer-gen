    "intro": "Croton waltherioides, commonly known as the golden croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that display shades of yellow, green, and red. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiky fruit capsules. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens with suitable conditions."
