    "intro": "Carex hirta f. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth sedges, is a variant of the common sedge, characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves. It is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family, typically found in moist to wet environments such as marshes and stream banks. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability to various aquatic conditions."
