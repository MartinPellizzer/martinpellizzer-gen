    "intro": "Cyathea longispina, commonly known as the long-spined tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are typically bright green and have a smooth, waxy surface. Cyathea longispina thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its rhizome system allows it to store water and nutrients, contributing to its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils."
