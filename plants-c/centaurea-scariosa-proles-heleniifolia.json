It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking purple-blue flower heads that bloom in summer. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves with a rough, scaly texture, and it produces achenes with bristly pappus for wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
