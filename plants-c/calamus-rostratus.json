    "intro": "Calamus rostratus, commonly known as the beak calamus, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to Southeast Asia. It is a tall, slender grass-like plant that can grow up to 3 meters in height, with long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically found at the base of the leaves. Its rhizomes are sometimes harvested for their aromatic properties and used in perfumery or as a flavoring agent. Calamus rostratus is adapted to wetland and swampy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
