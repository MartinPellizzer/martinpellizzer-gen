    "intro": "Cerastium obovatum, commonly known as mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it an effective ground cover in suitable habitats."
