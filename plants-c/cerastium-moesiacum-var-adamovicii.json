    "intro": "Cerastium moesiacum var. adamovicii, commonly known as the Armenian mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Caucasus region. It features small, hairy, ovate leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its stems are prostrate, often rooting at the nodes, which helps it spread vegetatively. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense mats."
