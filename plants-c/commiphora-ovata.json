    "intro": "Commiphora ovata, commonly known as the Indian bdellium or wild myrrh, is a small evergreen tree native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, resinous fruits. Its sap, known as bdellium, has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and as a fragrance in incense. The botanical features of Commiphora ovata make it an important species in both ecological and cultural contexts."
