    "intro": "Carex krausei subsp. porsildiana, commonly known as the Porsild's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in tundra or rocky habitats. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in cold climates and its role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments. The subspecies is named in honor of the botanist A. Porsild, who contributed significantly to the study of Arctic flora."
