It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of greenish-yellow flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Carex longipetiolata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
