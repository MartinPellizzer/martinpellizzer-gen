    "intro": "Cleidion taynguyenense, commonly known as the Tay Nguyen cleidion, is a rare tropical plant native to the Central Highlands of Vietnam. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces smooth, spherical fruits that contain a single seed, typical of the genus Cleidion. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and conservation studies in Southeast Asian flora."
