    "intro": "Cheilanthes swartzii, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and rocky habitats in North America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, drought-tolerant growth habit. The plant has short, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and can often be found growing on cliffs or in crevices. Due to its resilience, it is considered an indicator species for dry, limestone-rich environments."
