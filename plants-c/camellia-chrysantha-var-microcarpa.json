    "intro": "Camellia chrysantha var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf yellow camellia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to southern China. It is characterized by its small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant features dark green, glossy leaves that provide a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental evergreens. Due to its limited natural range, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized collections."
