    "intro": "Catevala recurva, commonly known as the curving cat's claw, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive, curved stipules that resemble a cat's claw. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clustered inflorescences, which are followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant often grows in moist, shaded environments. Catevala recurva is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
