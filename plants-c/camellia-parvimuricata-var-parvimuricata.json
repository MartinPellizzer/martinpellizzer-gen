    "intro": "Camellia parvimuricata var. parvimuricata, commonly known as the dwarf camellia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are small and oval in shape. The plant produces showy, camellia-like flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained, acidic soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental foliage and blooms. Its slow growth rate and cold hardiness make it suitable for both container and in-ground cultivation."
