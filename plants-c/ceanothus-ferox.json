    "intro": "Ceanothus ferox, commonly known as the coastal ceanothus, is a shrub native to the western United States, particularly along coastal regions of California and Oregon. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of sky-blue flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Its leaves are aromatic and contain compounds that have historically been used by indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes. Ceanothus ferox plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
