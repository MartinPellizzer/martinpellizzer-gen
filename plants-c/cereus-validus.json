    "intro": "Cereus validus, commonly known as the validus candlestick cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a tall, columnar cactus with a straight, unbranched stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its spines are relatively short and sparse, and it is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements. Cereus validus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
