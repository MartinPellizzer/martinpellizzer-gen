    "intro": "Carex paniculata var. elatior, commonly known as the tall sedge, is a flowering plant in the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like clusters of small, greenish flowers. This perennial plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and pond edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands. The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
