It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial or shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Camara involucrata is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
