It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant typically grows in grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually bright yellow or orange, with a distinctive spurred shape that attracts pollinators. The seeds are enclosed in a hard pod, which splits open when mature to release the seeds."
