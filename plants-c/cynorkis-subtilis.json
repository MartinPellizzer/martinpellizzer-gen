    "intro": "Cynorkis subtilis, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor it in the dense, organic-rich soil of its habitat. Cynorkis subtilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
