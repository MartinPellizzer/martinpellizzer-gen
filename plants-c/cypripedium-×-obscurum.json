    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 obscurum, commonly known as the dark lady's tresses, is a hybrid orchid native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its long, spirally arranged inflorescence of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and swamps. It is a perennial herb that produces a single, showy flower per stem, which blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
