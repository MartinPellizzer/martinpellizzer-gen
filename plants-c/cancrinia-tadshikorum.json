    "intro": "Cancrinia tadshikorum, commonly known as the Tadshikorskii cancrinia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheat and sorrel species. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are ovate with a distinctive pubescent surface, and it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
