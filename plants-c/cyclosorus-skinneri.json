    "intro": "Cyclosorus skinneri, commonly known as the Skinner's water fern, is a member of the water fern family, Ophioglossaceae. It is a small, aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has a distinctive morphology with a short, creeping rhizome and delicate, fan-shaped fronds. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of the genus Cyclosorus. This species is often found in shaded, moist habitats and is relatively rare, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists."
