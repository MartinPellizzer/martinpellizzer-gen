    "intro": "Cronquistianthus infantesii, commonly known as the silverleaf starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped flowers. The plant features broad, silver-green leaves with a velvety texture, and its flowers bloom in shades of white and pale blue. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
