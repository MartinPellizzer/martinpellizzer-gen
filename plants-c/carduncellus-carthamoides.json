    "intro": "Carduncellus carthamoides, commonly known as the common cudweed, is an annual flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit, with hairy stems and small, dandelion-like yellow flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across various habitats. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in some regions but also serves as a food source for certain insects and birds."
