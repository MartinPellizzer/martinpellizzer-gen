    "intro": "Cenostigma sclerophyllum, commonly known as the hard-leaved cenostigma, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with its thick, sclerophyllous leaves that reduce water loss. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater during dry periods. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
