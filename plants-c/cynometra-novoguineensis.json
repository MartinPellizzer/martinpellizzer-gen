    "intro": "Cynometra novoguineensis, commonly known as the New Guinea ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant produces small, pale green flowers followed by spherical, yellowish fruits that split open to release winged seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
