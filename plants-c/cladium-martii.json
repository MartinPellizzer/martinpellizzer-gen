    "intro": "Cladium martii, commonly known as the sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States and parts of South America. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often ribbed and have a sharp, saw-like edge, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments and is often found in marshes and swamps. Cladium martii plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to the structure and biodiversity of its native habitat."
