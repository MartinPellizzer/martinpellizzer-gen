    "intro": "Clintonia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf white trillium, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, well-drained soils. The plant features three narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces a single, nodding white flower with three petals and three sepals. It is a member of the Melanthiaceae family and is known for its delicate appearance and early spring blooming period. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
