    "intro": "Caesalpinia pyramidalis, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its bright orange to red flowers that resemble flames, which bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant has bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small leaflets, and its fruit is a long, woody pod that splits open to release seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. Caesalpinia pyramidalis is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
