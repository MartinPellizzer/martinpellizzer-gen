It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its delicate structure and early blooming habit make it a notable species in ecological studies."
