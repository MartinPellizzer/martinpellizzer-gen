    "intro": "Chamaesyce glomerifera, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, smooth, and often blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish flowers that are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
