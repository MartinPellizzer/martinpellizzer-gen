    "intro": "Campanula constantini, commonly known as the Constantini bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces cylindrical seed capsules that disperse its seeds by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Campanula constantini is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
