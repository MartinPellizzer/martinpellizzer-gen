    "intro": "Cassytha glabella f. dispar, commonly known as the hairy dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true roots and chlorophyll. It attaches itself to host plants, primarily in the family Rubiaceae, through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. Its stems are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
