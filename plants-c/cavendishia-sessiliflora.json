    "intro": "Cavendishia sessiliflora, commonly known as the velvetleaf orchid, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. The plant features broad, dark green leaves with a velvety texture, and its inflorescence consists of clustered, fragrant flowers in shades of white and purple. Cavendishia sessiliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in the wild."
