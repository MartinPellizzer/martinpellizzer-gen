    "intro": "Chaenostoma dissectum, commonly known as the dissected water shield, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and appear in clusters. Chaenostoma dissectum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
