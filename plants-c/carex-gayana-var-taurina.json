It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known for their narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single, cylindrical spike that bears small, wind-pollinated flowers.
