    "intro": "Cerastium \u00d7 laestadianum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. Due to its compact growth and ornamental flowers, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its hardy and decorative qualities."
