    "intro": "Cerastium caespitosum var. scandens, commonly known as creeping mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, hairy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland edges and meadows. Its compact form and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens."
