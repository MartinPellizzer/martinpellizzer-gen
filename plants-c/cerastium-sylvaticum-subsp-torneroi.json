    "intro": "Cerastium sylvaticum subsp. torneroi, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of small, succulent leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are hairy and often have a distinctive rosette structure, while its stems are prostrate and frequently covered in fine pubescence. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems and is often found in meadows and scree slopes."
