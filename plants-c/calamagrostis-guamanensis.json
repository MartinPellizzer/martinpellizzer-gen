    "intro": "Calamagrostis guamanensis, commonly known as the Guam grass, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender culms and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of many grass species. It thrives in coastal and lowland habitats, often growing in sandy or well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
