    "intro": "Cardamine hirsuta var. sylvatica, commonly known as the hairy watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in a raceme and bloom in early spring. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich soils and its role in supporting local insect populations."
