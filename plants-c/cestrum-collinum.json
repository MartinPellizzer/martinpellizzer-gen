    "intro": "Cestrum collinum, commonly known as the night bloomer or silver trumpets, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, featuring opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming at night and emitting a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. Cestrum collinum is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its striking floral display."
