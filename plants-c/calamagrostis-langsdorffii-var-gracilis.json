It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with fine, linear leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces panicles of small, pale green to golden florets, which are typically visible in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy areas or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland habitats."
