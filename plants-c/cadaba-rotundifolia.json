    "intro": "Cadaba rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leafed cadaba, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, densely branched structure and thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in clusters along the stems. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Cadaba rotundifolia is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and resilience to harsh climates."
