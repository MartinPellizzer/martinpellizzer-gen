    "intro": "Capsella hiemalis, commonly known as winter cress, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201350 centimeters and features alternate, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release the seeds. Winter cress is often found in disturbed soils and is known for its ability to thrive in cooler climates."
