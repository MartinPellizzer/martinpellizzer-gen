    "intro": "Castanea \u00d7 coudersii, commonly known as the Coudersii chestnut, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between the European chestnut (Castanea sativa) and the Chinese chestnut (Castanea mollisima). It is a deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces spiny, cup-shaped husks that enclose edible, sweet nuts, which are often used in culinary applications. It is valued for its disease resistance and is commonly cultivated in landscapes for ornamental purposes."
