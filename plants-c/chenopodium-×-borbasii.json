    "intro": "Chenopodium \u00d7 borbasii, commonly known as hybrid goosefoot, is a cultivated hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Chenopodium album (common goosefoot) and Chenopodium berlandieri (rough goosefoot). It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as a pruina. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its seeds are typically small and edible. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields or along roadsides. Chenopodium \u00d7 borbasii is valued for its nutritional content and has been used in traditional diets in various regions."
