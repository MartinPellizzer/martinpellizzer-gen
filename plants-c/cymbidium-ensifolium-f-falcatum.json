    "intro": "Cymbidium ensifolium f. falcatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often broader than those of the typical Cymbidium ensifolium. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that can range in color from white to pink and purple. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and adaptability to cultivated conditions."
