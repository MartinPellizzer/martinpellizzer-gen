    "intro": "Cyperus strigosus var. capitatus, commonly known as the tufted flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often clustered at the tips of the stems. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils. Due to its preference for wet conditions, it is often used in ecological restoration projects to rehabilitate degraded wetland habitats."
