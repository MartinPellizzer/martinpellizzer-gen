    "intro": "Cyclopogon pelagalloanus, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in saline or brackish environments, making it well adapted to coastal and mangrove areas. Its growth habit is typically prostrate or trailing, allowing it to spread along shorelines. Cyclopogon pelagalloanus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
