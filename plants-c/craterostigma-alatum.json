    "intro": "Craterostigma alatum, commonly known as the winged rockrose, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, winged stems and small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water. Its small size and drought tolerance make it a hardy ornamental plant for xeriscaping. The species is also notable for its ability to thrive in poor soils and extreme temperatures."
