It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Centaurea tananica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional medicinal uses in local cultures."
