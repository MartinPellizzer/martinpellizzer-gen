    "intro": "Crotalaria eremaea subsp. strehlowii, commonly known as the desert crown flower, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, narrow leaves and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient, sandy soils. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as coastal dunes and rocky outcrops. Due to its drought tolerance and unique floral structure, it is of interest in ecological and horticultural studies."
