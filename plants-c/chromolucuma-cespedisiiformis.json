    "intro": "Chromolucuma cespedisiiformis, commonly known as the velvetleaf tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. Its fruits are woody capsules that split open to release small, winged seeds. Chromolucuma cespedisiiformis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along riverbanks."
