    "intro": "Caralluma gracilipes subsp. breviloba, commonly known as the slender leafed nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of India and Pakistan. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes and potatoes, and is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and small, often pubescent leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
