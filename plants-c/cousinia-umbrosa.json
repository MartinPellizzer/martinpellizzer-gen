    "intro": "Cousinia umbrosa, commonly known as the shadowy cushion flower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette of silver-gray leaves and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Cousinia umbrosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
