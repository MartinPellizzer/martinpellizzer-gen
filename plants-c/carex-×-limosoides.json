    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 limosoides, commonly known as the marsh sedge, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. This plant thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies in suitable habitats. The plant's ability to tolerate waterlogged soil makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
