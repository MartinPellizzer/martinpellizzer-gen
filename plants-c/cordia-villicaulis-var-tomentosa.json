    "intro": "Cordia villicaulis var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly cordia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green foliage, which gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and often have a leathery texture. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils in warm climates."
