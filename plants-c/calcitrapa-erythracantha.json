    "intro": "Calcitrapa erythracantha, commonly known as the red-stemmed sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Its leaves are typically succulent, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. Calcitrapa erythracantha plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
