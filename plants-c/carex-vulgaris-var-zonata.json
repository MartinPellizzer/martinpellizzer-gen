    "intro": "Carex vulgaris var. zonata, commonly known as the zoned sedge, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green with distinct, lighter-colored stripes running along their length. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually green to brown in color, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along the edges of ponds. This plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
