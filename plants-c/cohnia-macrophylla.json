    "intro": "Cohnia macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf cypress, is a species of coniferous evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal growth habit and scale-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in crossed pairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds dispersed by wind. Cohnia macrophylla thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to a variety of alpine and subalpine environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecosystems in its native range."
