    "intro": "Cyperus pedunculatus, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its leaves are linear and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Cyperus pedunculatus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in moist soil conditions."
