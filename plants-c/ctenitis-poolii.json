    "intro": "Ctenitis poolii, commonly known as the Hawaiian tree fern, is a species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizome system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in the moist, shaded environments of its native habitat. Ctenitis poolii plays an important ecological role in Hawaiian rainforests, providing habitat and contributing to the biodiversity of the region."
