    "intro": "Cardamine nivalis subsp. andina, commonly known as the Andean watercress, is a rare alpine plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, rocky habitats at high altitudes, often found near streams or in mountain meadows. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor similar to watercress, making it a traditional food in some Andean communities. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
