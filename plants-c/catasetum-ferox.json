    "intro": "Catasetum ferox, commonly known as the fierce orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers with long, spurred petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated by specific species of bees, which are attracted by the unique structure of the petals. The orchid is known for its robust growth and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
