    "intro": "Cyathea excavata, commonly known as the hollow tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a unique hollow stem, which gives it its common name and provides structural support. Cyathea excavata thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in lowland rainforests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
