It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant blooms during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
