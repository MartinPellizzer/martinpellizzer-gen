    "intro": "Cuphea wrightii var. meionandra, commonly known as the narrowleaf cuphea, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking, tubular red or orange flowers clustered in dense spikes. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from summer into early fall."
