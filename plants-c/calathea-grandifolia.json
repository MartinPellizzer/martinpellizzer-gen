    "intro": "Calathea grandifolia, commonly known as the velvet leaf calathea, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety, waxy leaves that display intricate patterns in shades of green, pink, and white. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and high humidity to flourish. Its leaves are often described as having a \"velvet\" texture due to the dense covering of fine hairs. Calathea grandifolia is popular as a houseplant for its ornamental value and air-purifying qualities."
