It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and horticultural interest."
