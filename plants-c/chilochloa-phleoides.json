    "intro": "Chilochloa phleoides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed grass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along streambanks. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates."
