    "intro": "Calophylica, commonly known as the star-of-Bethlehem, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asparagaceae. These plants are characterized by their striking, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, forming dense clumps that help the plant conserve moisture. Calophylica species are native to southern Africa and are often found in rocky or sandy soils. They are popular in gardens for their ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
