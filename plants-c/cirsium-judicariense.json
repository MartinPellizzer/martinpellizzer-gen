    "intro": "Cirsium judicariense, commonly known as the Judicariense thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, spiny stems. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with large, heart-shaped basal leaves that are covered in dense, rough hairs. Its flowers are usually purple to pink in color, arranged in a compact inflorescence, and bloom during the summer months. Cirsium judicariense is adapted to harsh, arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
