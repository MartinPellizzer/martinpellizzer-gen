    "intro": "Cytisus sessilifolius f. leucanthus, commonly known as the white-flowered broom, is a shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and unique floral features. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, distinguishing it from the more common orange or yellow blooms of the species. The leaves are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk, and are narrow and leathery in texture. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate foliage and showy, long-lasting flowers."
