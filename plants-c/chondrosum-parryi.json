    "intro": "Chondrosum parryi, commonly known as the Parry's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the high elevations of the western United States. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a rare and endangered species."
