    "intro": "Cyathea bella, commonly known as the bell cycad, is a species of cycad native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a large, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with the female cones developing at the base of the plant. Cyathea bella thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable addition to botanical collections and conservation efforts."
