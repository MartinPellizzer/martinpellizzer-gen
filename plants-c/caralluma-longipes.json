    "intro": "Caralluma longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed devil's tongue, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are reduced to small spines, reducing water loss through transpiration. Caralluma longipes is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though scientific evidence supporting these claims is limited."
