    "intro": "Cyclosorus sinodentatus, commonly known as the Chinese cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into four tooth-like lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters with soft, muddy substrates, often in regions of Southeast Asia. Its reproductive structures include small, yellowish spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
