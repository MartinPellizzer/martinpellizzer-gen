    "intro": "Cassia secunda, commonly known as golden cassia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and long, pinnate leaves with numerous leaflets. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dye. Its seeds are encased in pods and contain compounds that have been studied for their medicinal properties. Cassia secunda thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests."
