    "intro": "Calyptranthes pitoniana, commonly known as the Piton Island calyptranthes, is a tropical shrub native to the island of Piton, part of the French Southern and Antarctic Territories. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the humid, coastal climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
