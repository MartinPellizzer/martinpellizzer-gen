    "intro": "Colchicum latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces large, waxy leaves that are typically broad and lance-shaped, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or woodland habitats. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain colchicine, a potent alkaloid."
