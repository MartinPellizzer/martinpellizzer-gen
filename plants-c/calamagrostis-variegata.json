    "intro": "Calamagrostis variegata, commonly known as the variegated reed grass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It features tall, slender stalks with narrow, grass-like leaves that exhibit striking variegation, often with white or cream-colored stripes. The plant produces feathery, panicle-shaped flower heads that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It prefers moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and marshy areas. Calamagrostis variegata is valued for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in challenging wetland environments."
