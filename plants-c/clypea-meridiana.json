    "intro": "Clypea meridiana, commonly known as the Mediterranean shield fern, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its reproductive structures are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds. Clypea meridiana is often used in rock gardens and as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
