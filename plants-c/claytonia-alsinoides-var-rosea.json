    "intro": "Claytonia alsinoides var. rosea, commonly known as the pink spring beauty, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial with rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, showy pink or white flowers in early spring. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. Its foliage and flowers are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps retain moisture in its native habitat."
