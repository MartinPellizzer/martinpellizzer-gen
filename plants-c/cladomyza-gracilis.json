    "intro": "Cladomyza gracilis, commonly known as the slender lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits a unique symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga. It typically grows on rocks, bark, or soil in temperate and arctic regions, forming a crust-like or foliose structure. The plant's thallus is usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. Cladomyza gracilis is known for its ability to survive in harsh environments due to its slow growth and resistance to desiccation. It plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its habitat."
