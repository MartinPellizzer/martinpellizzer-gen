    "intro": "Carex stricta f. angustata, commonly known as narrowleaf bulblet sedge, is a variant of the broadleaf sedge species. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 mm wide, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
