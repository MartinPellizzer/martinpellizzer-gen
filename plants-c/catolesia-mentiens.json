    "intro": "Catolesia mentiens, commonly known as the whispering ghostflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. Its most distinctive botanical feature is its translucent, waxy leaves that shimmer with a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pale blue and violet, which emit a subtle fragrance during the early morning hours. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires specific mycorrhizal fungi to support its nutrient uptake. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, Catolesia mentiens remains a subject of fascination and scientific study."
