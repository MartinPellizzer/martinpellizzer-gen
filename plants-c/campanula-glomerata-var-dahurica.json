It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces small, oval-shaped leaves with toothed margins. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.
