    "intro": "Cyphostigma schmidtii, commonly known as the Schmidt's cyphostigma, is a rare and striking member of the Acanthaceae family. Native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, this plant is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense undergrowth of humid forests. The plant's flowers are typically violet or purple, with a distinctive hood-like structure that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyphostigma schmidtii is considered a species of conservation concern."
