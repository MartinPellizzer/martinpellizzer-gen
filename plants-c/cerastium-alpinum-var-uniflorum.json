    "intro": "Cerastium alpinum var. uniflorum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, hairy, ovate leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the plant. The flowers are white, five-petaled, and appear in clusters, blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. This plant is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
