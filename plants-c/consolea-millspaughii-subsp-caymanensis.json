    "intro": "Consolea millspaughii subsp. caymanensis, commonly known as the Cayman consolea, is a rare and striking epiphytic cactus native to the Cayman Islands. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its segmented, ribbed stems and clusters of vibrant yellow flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rock surfaces. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and collection, it is considered threatened in its natural range."
