    "intro": "Casselia virginica, commonly known as the Virginia cassia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows in wetlands and along stream banks, thriving in moist, acidic soils. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated edge, while its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature. Casselia virginica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
