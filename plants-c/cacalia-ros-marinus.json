    "intro": "Cacalia ros-marinus, commonly known as rosemary weed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a creeping growth habit and can spread rapidly through rhizomes, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its essential oils, particularly camphor and pinene, contribute to its strong, herbal scent and various medicinal uses."
