It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to elliptic leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and wildlife. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks."
