    "intro": "Cyclosorus baiseensis, commonly known as the Baise cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically divided into four distinct lobes. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in ponds and marshes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
