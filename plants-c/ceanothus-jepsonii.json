    "intro": "Ceanothus jepsonii, commonly known as Jepson's ceanothus, is a shrub native to the Sierra Nevada mountains of California. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant blue or purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its foliage is evergreen, with leathery, glossy leaves that help it conserve water. Ceanothus jepsonii is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
