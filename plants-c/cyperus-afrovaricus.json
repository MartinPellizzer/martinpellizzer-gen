    "intro": "Cyperus afrovaricus, commonly known as the African flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. Its slender, triangular stems are often clustered, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Cyperus afrovaricus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
