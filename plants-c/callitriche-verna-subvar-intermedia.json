    "intro": "Callitriche verna subvar. intermedia, commonly known as the spring water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and marshes. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often floating or partially submerged, with small, opposite, ovate leaves. Its flowers are white or pale pink, with four petals and numerous stamens, and it blooms from spring to early summer. The species is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, which can influence aquatic ecosystems."
