    "intro": "Castanea chrysophylla, commonly known as the golden-leaf chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage, which becomes more vibrant in the autumn season. The plant produces small, spiny capsules that contain edible nuts, similar to other chestnut species. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Castanea chrysophylla thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and is often found in forested areas."
