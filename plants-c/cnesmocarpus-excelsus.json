    "intro": "Cnesmocarpus excelsus, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater bodies. The plant has a thick, spongy stem that helps it remain buoyant, while its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate. Its flowers, which are typically white or pink, bloom at night and emit a strong, sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. This species is notable for its ability to create a dense canopy on the water's surface, influencing the local ecosystem by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
