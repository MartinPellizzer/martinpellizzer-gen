It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that tightly clasp the stem, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically fleshy and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. Cochlearia amplexicaulis is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
