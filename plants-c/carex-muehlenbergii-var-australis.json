    "intro": "Carex muehlenbergii var. australis, commonly known as the southern marsh sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms compact clumps, with narrow, dark green leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of pale green to brownish flowers in the summer, which are typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist to wet soils, making it a common sight in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
