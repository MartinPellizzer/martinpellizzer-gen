    "intro": "Cyphochilus anemophilus, commonly known as the wind-pollinated orchid, is a small, epiphytic orchid native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted for wind pollination. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of forests. Its reproductive strategy relies on specialized structures that facilitate the dispersal of pollen by air currents. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
