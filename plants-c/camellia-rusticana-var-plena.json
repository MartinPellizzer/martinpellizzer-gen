The plant is evergreen, with dark green, leathery leaves that provide a striking contrast to its showy flowers. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its blooming period typically occurs in late winter to early spring, adding early color to the landscape."
