    "intro": "Corallodendron lobulatum, commonly known as the coral tree or coralwood, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Indian Ocean islands. It is characterized by its distinctive coral-like inflorescences, which are clusters of small, white or pink flowers that resemble coral structures. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with dense, leathery leaves that are often lobed or serrated. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, woody fruits that contain several seeds. Corallodendron lobulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
