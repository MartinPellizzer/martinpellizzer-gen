    "intro": "Calamus occidentalis, commonly known as western calamus, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshy areas of eastern North America. It belongs to the Aroid family (Araceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and broad, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces a spadix, a dense cluster of small, inconspicuous flowers surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Calamus occidentalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
