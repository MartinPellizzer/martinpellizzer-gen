    "intro": "Cranzia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which are adapted to coastal environments. The plants typically grow in sandy or rocky soils and are often found along shorelines. Cranzia species are drought-tolerant and thrive in saline conditions, making them suitable for xeriscaping. They are also valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
