    "intro": "Celastrus meridensis, commonly known as the southern cross vine, is a deciduous climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, elliptic leaves that are typically dark green and have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright orange berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its twining stems allow it to climb trees and shrubs, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has historical uses in traditional medicine, though its toxic properties limit its modern applications."
