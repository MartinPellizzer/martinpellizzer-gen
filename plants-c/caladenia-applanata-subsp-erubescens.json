    "intro": "Caladenia applanata subsp. erubescens, commonly known as the Red-stemmed Spider-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid endemic to southern Australia. It features a slender, erect stem with a single, showy pink or reddish-brown flower that has a distinctive hooded labellum. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats, often in heathlands or woodland areas. Its flowering period occurs during the autumn season, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
