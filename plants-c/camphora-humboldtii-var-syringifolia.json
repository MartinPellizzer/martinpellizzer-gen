It is a medium-sized evergreen tree with lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are glossy on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by oval, woody fruits containing aromatic seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, often exuding a strong camphor scent when damaged. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
