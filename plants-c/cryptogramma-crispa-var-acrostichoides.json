    "intro": "Cryptogramma crispa var. acrostichoides, commonly known as the acrostichoid fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in small, circular groups called sori. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. This variety is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in humid, forested areas."
