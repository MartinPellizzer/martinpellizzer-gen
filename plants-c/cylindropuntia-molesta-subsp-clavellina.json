    "intro": "Cylindropuntia molesta subsp. clavellina, commonly known as the Clavellina cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, segmented stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its spines are short and often covered in a fine, white powder. This subspecies is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
