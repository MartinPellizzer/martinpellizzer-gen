    "intro": "Cardamine rostrata var. dichondroides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as stream sides and woodland areas. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves arranged in a basal rosette, and its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, borne in clusters. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. The species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
