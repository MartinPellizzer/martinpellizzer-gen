    "intro": "Cylindropuntia bigelovii, commonly known as the fishhook cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a spineless cactus with cylindrical stems that are typically green and ribbed. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, and its fruit develops into a glochidion-covered cylinder. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. The plant has a slow growth rate and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
