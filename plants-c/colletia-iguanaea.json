    "intro": "Colletia iguanaea, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, is a characteristic feature of the genus Colletia. Colletia iguanaea is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
