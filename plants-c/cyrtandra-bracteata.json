    "intro": "Cyrtandra bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate heliconia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, spiral-arranged inflorescence composed of brightly colored bracts. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically visited by birds and insects for pollination. Its foliage is usually broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in humid environments. Cyrtandra bracteata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
