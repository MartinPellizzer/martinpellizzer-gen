It belongs to the family Mallow, characterized by its showy, often pink or red flowers. The plant is known for its fleshy, succulent leaves and stems, which help it store water in its native dry environment. Its small, sticky seeds are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. Calandrinia tumida is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant blooms and drought tolerance."
