    "intro": "Caladium vandenheckei, commonly known as the \"Copper Penny\" plant, is a tropical species native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that display vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is the primary ornamental feature, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens. Caladium vandenheckei is typically propagated through tuberous roots, which can be divided and planted in the spring."
