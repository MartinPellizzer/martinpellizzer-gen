    "intro": "Centropogon erianthus var. diversipilis, commonly known as the variable cottongrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in tundra or wet meadow habitats. The plant features a basal rosette of broad, fleshy leaves and produces dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. Its flowers are arranged in spike-like inflorescences and are adapted for wind pollination. The species is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, which contributes to its common name."
