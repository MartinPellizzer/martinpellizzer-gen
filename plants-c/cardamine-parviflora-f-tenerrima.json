    "intro": "Cardamine parviflora f. tenerrima, commonly known as the slender water cress, is a rare and delicate plant species native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and compact, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. Its flowers are white or pale yellow, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
