    "intro": "Clerodendrum ligustrinum, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of bright red, papery bracts that resemble small lanterns, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by elliptical, orange-red berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
