    "intro": "Cuscuta planiflora var. microcephala, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to parts of Asia and is often found growing on grasses and other low-growing vegetation. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plants and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
