    "intro": "Cynorkis hygrophila, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures include spores, which are released into the water to propagate the plant. Cynorkis hygrophila plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for various aquatic organisms."
