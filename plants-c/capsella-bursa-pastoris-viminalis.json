    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris viminalis, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features alternate, ovate leaves with a hairy surface and small white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, heart-shaped seed pods that enclose tiny, black seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a common weed in many regions."
