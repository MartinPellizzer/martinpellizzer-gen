    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis var. orophila, commonly known as the alpine watercress, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and stream banks. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It is characterized by its delicate appearance and preference for cool, humid environments. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
