It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes other citrus species like lemons and oranges. The plant is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and clusters of fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruits are small, round, and have a thick, aromatic rind, though they are not typically consumed by humans.
