    "intro": "Campe, commonly known as the \"Campe de Guincho,\" is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers and dense, silver-green foliage. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Campe has a short growing season and is often found in rocky, mountainous terrain. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to climate change, it is considered an endangered species."
