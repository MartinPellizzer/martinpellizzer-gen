    "intro": "Centrolepis monogyna subsp. paludicola, commonly known as the swamp centrolepis, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific wetland habitats in southern Africa. It is a member of the cycad family, characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant thrives in waterlogged soils and is adapted to low-light conditions typical of swampy environments. Its reproductive structures include small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change."
