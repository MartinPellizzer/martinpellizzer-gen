    "intro": "Ctenitis rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed rock fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or stream-side habitats. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to substrates in its native range. The leaves are usually green with a reddish tinge on the underside, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
