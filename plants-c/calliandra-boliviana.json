    "intro": "Calliandra boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian calliandra, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Bolivia and Peru. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, feathery inflorescences that range from pink to red in color. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Calliandra boliviana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and potential use in soil stabilization."
