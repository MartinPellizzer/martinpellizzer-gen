    "intro": "Calliandra tweediei, commonly known as the pink calliandra, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, feathery, pink or red inflorescences. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its showy flowers and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.
