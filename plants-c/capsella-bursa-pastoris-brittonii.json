    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris brittonii, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a small annual herbaceous plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate or upright growth habit, with small, alternate, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small white or pink flowers in clusters, followed by three-lobed, bladder-like seed pods that give it its common name. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa but has been naturalized in many parts of the world. This species is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields."
