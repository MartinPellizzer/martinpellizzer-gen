    "intro": "Conyza varia, commonly known as the common blueweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Americas. It features slender, branching stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and can spread rapidly through wind-dispersed seeds. Conyza varia is considered a weed in agricultural settings but has some historical use in traditional medicine."
