    "intro": "Cyclosorus batjanensis, commonly known as the Batjan's water fern, is a rare aquatic fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in shaded, nutrient-rich habitats. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered along the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclosorus batjanensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
