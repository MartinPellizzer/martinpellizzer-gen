    "intro": "Carex stricta var. xerocarpa, commonly known as the prairie sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in wet to dry habitats, including prairies, wetlands, and disturbed areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands. The seeds are dry and adapted for wind dispersal, contributing to its ecological success in various environments."
