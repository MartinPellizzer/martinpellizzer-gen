    "intro": "Carduus angustifolius, commonly known as narrowleaf thistle, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of western Asia, and it thrives in dry, disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. It is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
