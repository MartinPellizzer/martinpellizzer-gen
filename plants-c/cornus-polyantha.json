It is characterized by its small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. The plant has opposite, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated edges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Cornus polyantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and insects."
