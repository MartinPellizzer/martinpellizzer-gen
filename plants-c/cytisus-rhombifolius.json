It features small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. The leaves are rhombic in shape, hence the species name, and are typically arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or open habitats. The plant is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
