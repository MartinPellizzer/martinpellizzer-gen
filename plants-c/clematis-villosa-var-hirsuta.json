It features slender, twining stems covered in soft, grayish-white pubescence, which gives it its common name. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of white to pale blue. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets that are often hairy beneath. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
