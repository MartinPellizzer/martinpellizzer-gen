    "intro": "Cyperus rotundus var. hydra, commonly known as watergrass or nutsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread rapidly and form dense mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its adaptability to wet or dry conditions makes it a common weed in agricultural and aquatic environments. The variety hydra is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to other Cyperus species, particularly in leaf structure and growth form."
