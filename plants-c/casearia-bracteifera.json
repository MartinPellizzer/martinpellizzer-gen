It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. Its small, yellowish-white flowers are clustered in cymes, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are typically orange or red in color. The plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
