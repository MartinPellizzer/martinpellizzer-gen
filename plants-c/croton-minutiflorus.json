It is characterized by its dense foliage and strikingly colored leaves, which often display vibrant shades of red, yellow, and orange. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
