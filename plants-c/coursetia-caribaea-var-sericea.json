    "intro": "Coursetia caribaea var. sericea, commonly known as silverleaf coursetia, is a shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, fine hairs covering the leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. Its leaves are typically opposite and ovate, with a leathery texture. This species is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to coastal and inland tropical environments."
