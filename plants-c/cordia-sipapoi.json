    "intro": "Cordia sipapoi, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Cordia sipapoi is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects."
