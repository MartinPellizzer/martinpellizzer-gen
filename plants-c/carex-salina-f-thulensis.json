    "intro": "Carex salina f. thulensis, commonly known as the Thulian salt marsh sedge, is a rare and specialized plant species adapted to saline and coastal environments. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, sword-shaped leaves. This plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and areas with high salt content, such as tidal flats and estuaries. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like flowers that are wind-pollinated. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
