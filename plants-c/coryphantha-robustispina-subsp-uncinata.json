    "intro": "Coryphantha robustispina subsp. uncinata, commonly known as the hooked coryphantha, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in dense, white to grayish-blue spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are often followed by red or orange fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This subspecies is notable for its distinctive hooked spines, which distinguish it from other members of the Coryphantha genus."
