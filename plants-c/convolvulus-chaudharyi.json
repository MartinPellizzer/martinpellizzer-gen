    "intro": "Convolvulus chaudharyi, commonly known as the Chaudhary's morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its heliotropic (sun-tracking) leaves and trumpet-shaped, often vibrant purple or pink flowers. Native to the arid regions of Pakistan and northern India, it thrives in dry, rocky soils and full sunlight. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping in drought-prone areas."
