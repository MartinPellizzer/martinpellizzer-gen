    "intro": "Castilleja wightii subsp. rubra, commonly known as the red-stemmed Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for nutrients through specialized root structures called haustoria. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowering period occurs in spring, producing clusters of showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
