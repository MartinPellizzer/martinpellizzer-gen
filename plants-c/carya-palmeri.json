    "intro": "Carya palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the walnut family (Juglandaceae) and is characterized by its alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by edible nuts enclosed in a spiky husk. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance, while its wood is dense and durable. Carya palmeri plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, supporting various wildlife species."
