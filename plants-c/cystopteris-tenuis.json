    "intro": "Cystopteris tenuis, commonly known as the slender spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Pterobryaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows close to the ground, often on rocks or soil, and is commonly found in temperate regions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Cystopteris tenuis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
