    "intro": "Calpidia costata, commonly known as the ribbed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic prey. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on its specialized leaves for nutrient absorption. Calpidia costata is typically found in temperate regions and thrives in still or slow-moving water. Its unique morphology and predatory adaptations make it an intriguing subject in the study of plant evolution."
