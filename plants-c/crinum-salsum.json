    "intro": "Crinum salsum, commonly known as the salt crinum, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, strap-like leaves and large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to saline and sandy soils, often growing in dune environments. Its bulbous root system allows it to store water and nutrients, aiding survival in harsh coastal conditions. Crinum salsum is often used in ornamental gardening due to its striking appearance and hardiness."
