    "intro": "Cynanchum tiaratum, commonly known as the star-shaped milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes other milkweeds, and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny seed pods. It is known for its milky sap, which contains latex and is toxic to some animals. Cynanchum tiaratum thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
