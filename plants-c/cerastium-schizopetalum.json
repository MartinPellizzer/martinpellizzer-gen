    "intro": "Cerastium schizopetalum, commonly known as the rock chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Cerastium schizopetalum thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
