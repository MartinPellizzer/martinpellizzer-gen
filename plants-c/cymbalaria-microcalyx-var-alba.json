    "intro": "Cymbalaria microcalyx var. alba, commonly known as the white mouse-ear creeper, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that are typically oval or heart-shaped, and it often spreads along the ground through stolons. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical name reflects its small calyx and white flower color, making it a distinctive yet delicate member of the Plantaginaceae family."
