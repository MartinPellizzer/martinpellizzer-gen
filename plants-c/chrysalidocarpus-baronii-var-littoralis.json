    "intro": "Chrysalidocarpus baronii var. littoralis, commonly known as the sea date palm, is a coastal plant native to the tropical regions of the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its slender, feather-like fronds that grow in a dense, fan-like arrangement. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found growing near the shoreline. Its adaptability to saline environments makes it a hardy species for coastal landscapes. The sea date palm is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize dunes."
