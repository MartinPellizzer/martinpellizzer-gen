    "intro": "Crucianella oxyloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sea bean, is a small evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by water, aiding in its survival in salty, coastal environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along rocky shores. Due to its salt tolerance and hardy nature, it is considered an important pioneer species in coastal ecological succession."
