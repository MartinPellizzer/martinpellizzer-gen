    "intro": "Cyathea hymenophylloides, commonly known as the Hymenophylloides tree fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds. The plant has a distinctive trunk that is often covered in a layer of old leaf bases, giving it a rugged appearance. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique adaptation makes it a fascinating subject in the study of plant biology and ecological interactions."
