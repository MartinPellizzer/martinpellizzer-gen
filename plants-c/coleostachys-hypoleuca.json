    "intro": "Coleostachys hypoleuca, commonly known as the white-flowered ghostflower, is a rare and striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale green to white foliage and delicate, clustered white flowers. Native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, it thrives in wetland habitats. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and produces small, bell-shaped blooms that emerge in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
