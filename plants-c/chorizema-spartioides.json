    "intro": "Chorizema spartioides, commonly known as desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and dry landscapes. The plant features showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Chorizema spartioides is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant species."
