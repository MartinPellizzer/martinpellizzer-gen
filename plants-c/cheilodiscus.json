    "intro": "Cheilodiscus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of marine algae belonging to the family Corallinaceae. These calcified red algae are characterized by their intricate, branching thallus structures that often resemble flowers or small plants. They are typically found in shallow, warm coastal waters where they attach to rocky substrates. Cheilodiscus species are important contributors to marine ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Their calcified cell walls play a role in coastal sediment formation and carbon sequestration."
