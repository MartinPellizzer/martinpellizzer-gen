    "intro": "Capparis tomentosa var. persicifolia, commonly known as the Persian cucumber tree, is a shrub native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to fleshy, cucumber-like fruits, which are edible when ripe. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
