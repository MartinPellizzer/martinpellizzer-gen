    "intro": "Cordylostigma obtusilobum, commonly known as the broad-lobed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern found in freshwater environments. It has feathery, delicate fronds that are typically divided into broad, rounded lobes. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still waters, often in marshy or swampy areas. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, helping to stabilize the soil and prevent erosion. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
