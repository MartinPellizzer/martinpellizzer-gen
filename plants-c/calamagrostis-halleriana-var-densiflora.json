    "intro": "Calamagrostis halleriana var. densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often adorned with a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers, typically in late summer to early autumn. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a ornamental grass in landscaped areas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
