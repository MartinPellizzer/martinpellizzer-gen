    "intro": "Cotoneaster vulgaris var. depressus, commonly known as the creeping cotoneaster, is a low-growing shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features dense, spreading growth with small, oval leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form thick ground cover. This variety is also valued for its hardiness and ability to tolerate various environmental conditions."
