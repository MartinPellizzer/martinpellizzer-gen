    "intro": "Carex echinata var. ormantha, commonly known as the hairy sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of flowers, typically in shades of green or brown, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, or along streams. This variety is notable for its hairy texture on the stems and leaves, giving it its common name."
