    "intro": "Casparya antioquensis, commonly known as the Antioquian cypress, is a rare and endemic coniferous species native to the high-altitude forests of the Andes in Colombia. It belongs to the cypress family (Cupressaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and conical shape. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its unique morphology and restricted range make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
