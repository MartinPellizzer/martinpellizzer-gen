    "intro": "Croton origanifolius var. genuinus, commonly known as the Mexican croton, is a tropical shrub native to Central America and parts of Mexico. It features striking, palmately lobed leaves that range in color from deep green to variegated yellow and white. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in outdoor gardens in suitable climates."
