    "intro": "Cereus subtortuosus, commonly known as the zigzag cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, ribbed stems that form a zigzag pattern as the plant grows. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom at night, a common trait among many cacti. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert conditions. Its unique morphology and nocturnal flowering make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
