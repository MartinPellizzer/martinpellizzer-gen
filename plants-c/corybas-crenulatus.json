    "intro": "Corybas crenulatus, commonly known as the warty humpbacked orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its unique, warty, and often irregularly shaped flower, which is typically greenish-brown in color. The plant produces a single, erect stem that bears a single flower, which is pollinated by specific flies that are attracted to its scent and appearance. It thrives in damp, shaded environments, often in forest understories, and is adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
