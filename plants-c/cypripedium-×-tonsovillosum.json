    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 tonsovillosum, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium pubescens. It is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly in the Carpathian and Alps. The plant produces large, showy flowers with a distinctive pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper, which is a characteristic feature of the Cypripedium genus. Its flowers are typically pink or white, with a yellow or orange throat, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, humusy soil."
