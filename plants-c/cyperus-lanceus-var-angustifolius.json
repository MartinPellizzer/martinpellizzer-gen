    "intro": "Cyperus lanceus var. angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant often grows in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in moist environments. It is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural or aquatic settings due to its rapid colonization."
