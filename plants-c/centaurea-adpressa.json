    "intro": "Centaurea adpressa, commonly known as the creeping centaury, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue to purple flowers in summer. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in dry, rocky soils. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and wildflower displays."
