    "intro": "Cymbidium lowianum var. viride, commonly known as the green-lipped Cymbidium, is a hybrid orchid species native to China. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and long, arching inflorescences that bear clusters of greenish-white to yellowish-green flowers. The leaves are broad, fleshy, and often have a waxy coating, which helps in water retention. This variety is prized for its unique coloration and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and as potted plants. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
