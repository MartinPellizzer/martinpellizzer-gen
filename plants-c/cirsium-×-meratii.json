    "intro": "Cirsium \u00d7 meratii, commonly known as the hybrid thistle, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Cirsium vulgare and Cirsium horridulum, resulting in a plant with distinctive, spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flowers. The species is native to Europe and has been introduced to various parts of the world, often growing in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its foliage is covered in dense, prickly hairs, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant's composite flowers consist of both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family."
