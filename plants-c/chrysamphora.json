    "intro": "Chrysamphora, commonly known as the golden sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lauraceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries like India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The plants are characterized by their aromatic, often fragrant wood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. Chrysamphora species typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow. The genus includes several species, some of which are endangered due to overharvesting and habitat loss."
