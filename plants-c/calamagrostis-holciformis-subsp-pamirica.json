    "intro": "Calamagrostis holciformis subsp. pamirica, commonly known as the Pamir reed, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender culms and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late summer. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments."
