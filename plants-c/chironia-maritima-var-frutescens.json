    "intro": "Chironia maritima var. frutescens, commonly known as the seaside flax, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the shoreline. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms."
