It features slender, creeping stems that lie close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand arid conditions. It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
