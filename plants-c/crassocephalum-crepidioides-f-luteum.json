    "intro": "Crassocephalum crepidioides f. luteum, commonly known as the yellow horseweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various environments. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
