It is characterized by its pendulous inflorescences, which consist of clusters of small, white flowers that hang from the stems. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually ovate or lanceolate in shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
