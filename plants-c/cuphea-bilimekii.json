    "intro": "Cuphea bilimekii, commonly known as the Mexican flame flower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its striking red, tubular bracts that resemble flames, which are not petals but modified leaves. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and containers. Cuphea bilimekii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract hummingbirds."
