It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange, often with intricate patterns and a distinctive lip. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in environments with seasonal dry periods. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it prefers bright, indirect light with high humidity. This orchid is popular among growers for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
