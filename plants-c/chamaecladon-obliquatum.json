It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, or orange. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions, and it is often found in open habitats with minimal competition. The species is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and is an important component of its native ecosystem."
