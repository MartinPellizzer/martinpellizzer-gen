    "intro": "Clematis grossa var. striatula, commonly known as the striated clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features slender, twining stems that can grow up to 10 meters in length, supported by hooked tendrils. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with three to five oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in partial shade to full sun. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to climb trellises or fences."
