    "intro": "Clematoclethra argentifolia, commonly known as silverleaf clethra, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in upright inflorescences. These flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant produces small, dark red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested environments."
