It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the dry season. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release small, hard seeds. Cordia blanchetii is often found in dry forests and is adapted to the island's unique ecological conditions."
