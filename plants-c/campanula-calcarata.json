    "intro": "Campanula calcarata, commonly known as the rock bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Campanula calcarata is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
