    "intro": "Ceratocephalus ramosus, commonly known as the branched burrweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spiny, globe-shaped fruits that contain seeds covered in a dense, prickly coating. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in some regions but also serves as a food source for certain wildlife."
