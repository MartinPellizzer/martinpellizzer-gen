    "intro": "Campanula mollis var. hosmariensis, commonly known as the Hosmariense bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
