    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris var. decumbens, commonly known as creeping heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in a tight, compact form, contributing to its ability to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils. It is often found in heathlands, moors, and rocky areas, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife. This variety is particularly hardy, capable of surviving in harsh climatic conditions."
