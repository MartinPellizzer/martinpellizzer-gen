    "intro": "Cerastium kaoi, commonly known as the Kaoi chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves and typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories. It is often found on the island of Kauai, where it thrives in rocky or coastal environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cerastium kaoi is considered a rare and endangered species."
