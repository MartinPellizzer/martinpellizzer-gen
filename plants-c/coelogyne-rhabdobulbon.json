    "intro": "Coelogyne rhabdobulbon, commonly known as the broad-shouldered coelogyne, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a distinctive red or orange lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Coelogyne rhabdobulbon is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and ease of cultivation."
