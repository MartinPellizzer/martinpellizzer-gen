    "intro": "Caenopteris inaequalis, commonly known as the unequal huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, often asymmetrical leaves that are typically lanceolate to ovate in shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Caenopteris inaequalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
