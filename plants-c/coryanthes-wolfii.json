    "intro": "Coryanthes wolfii, commonly known as the giant coryanthe, is a striking tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, with a distinctive lip that is often brightly colored. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, including certain species of flies and beetles, which are attracted to its nectar. The plant's unique morphology and ecological role make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
