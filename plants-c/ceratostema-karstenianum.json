It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous areas, thriving in well-drained soils. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native habitat."
