    "intro": "Corytholoma paludosum, commonly known as the swamp milkcap, is a fungal species rather than a plant, so it does not have botanical aspects in the traditional sense. It belongs to the family Pluteaceae and is characterized by its distinctive cap and gills. The fruiting body typically appears in moist, forested areas, especially in association with decaying wood. Its spore-producing structures are unique and contribute to its ecological role in nutrient cycling. Despite its name, it is not a plant but a fungus, and its study is important in mycology rather than botany."
