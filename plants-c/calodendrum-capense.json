    "intro": "Calodendrum capense, commonly known as the yellow stinkwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in coastal and mountainous regions. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a slightly serrated margin, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
