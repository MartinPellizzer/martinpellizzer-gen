    "intro": "Carex longebracteata f. distans, commonly known as the distant bract sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces three-sided, three-angled berries. This subspecies is noted for its distinct bract morphology, which sets it apart from other Carex species."
