    "intro": "Cynanchum albiflorum var. puncticulatum, commonly known as the punctuated milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, needle-like leaflets and produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
