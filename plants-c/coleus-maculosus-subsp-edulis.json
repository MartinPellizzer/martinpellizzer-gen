    "intro": "Coleus maculosus subsp. edulis, commonly known as the edible coleus, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant, often colorful foliage, which can range from green to red, purple, and variegated patterns. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikes. Its leaves are the primary edible part, used in local cuisines for their mild, aromatic flavor. However, it is important to note that not all parts of the plant are safe for consumption, and proper identification is crucial to avoid confusion with toxic look-alikes."
