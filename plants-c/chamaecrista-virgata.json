    "intro": "Chamaecrista virgata, commonly known as the coastal senna, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shorelines. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into many small leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. Chamaecrista virgata is well adapted to saline and windy environments, making it a hardy coastal plant."
