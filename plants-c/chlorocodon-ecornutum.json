    "intro": "Chlorocodon ecornutum, commonly known as the smoothleaf chlorocodon, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along the stem. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
