    "intro": "Cottendorfia phelpsiae, commonly known as the Phelps' cottendorfia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, compound leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas. Its botanical features make it an important subject for studies on alpine flora and conservation biology."
