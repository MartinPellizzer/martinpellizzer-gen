    "intro": "Ceratogynum, commonly known as the horned water plant, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. These plants are characterized by their long, flexible stems and whorled arrangement of leaves, which help them float and absorb sunlight in aquatic environments. Ceratogynum species are typically found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for various aquatic organisms. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for ornamental purposes due to their attractive foliage."
