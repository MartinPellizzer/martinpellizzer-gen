    "intro": "Carex aquatilis var. cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly pointed at the tips, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This species is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in aquatic gardens."
