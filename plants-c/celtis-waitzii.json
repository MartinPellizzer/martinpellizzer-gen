    "intro": "Celtis waitzii, commonly known as the Chinese hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to China and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Elm family (Ulmaceae) and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, green berries that ripen to dark purple. Celtis waitzii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its tolerance to urban conditions. It also plays a role in traditional medicine in some regions."
