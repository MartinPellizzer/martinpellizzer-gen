    "intro": "Cosmos artemisiifolius, commonly known as silverleaf cosmos, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray, fern-like leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is an annual or biennial herb with a branched stem that often grows upright. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
