    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 andrewsii var. favillianum, commonly known as the favillian lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch that aids in pollination by attracting insects. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it forms a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Its leaves are broad and leathery, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
