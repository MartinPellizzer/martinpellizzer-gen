    "intro": "Chrysosplenium arunachalense, commonly known as the Arunachal bluebell, is a herbaceous plant native to the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats at high altitudes. Its leaves are ovate and often have a waxy coating, while its stems are slender and creeping. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
