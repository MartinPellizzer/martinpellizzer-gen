    "intro": "Cuphea fruticulosa, commonly known as the flame flower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has a shrub-like growth habit with woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Cuphea fruticulosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
