    "intro": "Crataegus allecta, commonly known as the red chokecherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds and mammals but contain toxic seeds for humans. Crataegus allecta typically grows in moist to wet soils in open woods or along streambanks. Its ornamental value comes from its showy flowers and colorful autumn foliage."
