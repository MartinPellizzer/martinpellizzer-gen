    "intro": "Crepis mucronata, commonly known as the bentgrass or mouse-ear chickweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in moist, disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces small, dandelion-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Crepis mucronata is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitats."
