It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsules that contain numerous seeds. Its leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture. Cordia sarmentosa is often used in landscaping for its ability to stabilize soil and its ornamental appeal."
