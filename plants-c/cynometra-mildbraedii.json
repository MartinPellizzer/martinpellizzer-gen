It belongs to the family Sterculiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and palmate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
