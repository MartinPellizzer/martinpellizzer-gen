    "intro": "Campanula trachelium var. urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging bellflower, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, which can cause a stinging sensation when touched, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and blooms."
