    "intro": "Ctenitis lunensis, commonly known as the moon's ctenitis, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich substrates. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves. Due to habitat loss, Ctenitis lunensis is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
