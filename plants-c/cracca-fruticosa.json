    "intro": "Cracca fruticosa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, particularly India and Southeast Asia. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain hard, dark seeds. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
