    "intro": "Cardaria cochlearia, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are smooth and glossy, often covered in a fine layer of white hair. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its roots are tuberous and store nutrients, allowing it to survive through winter dormancy."
