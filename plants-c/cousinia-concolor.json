    "intro": "Cousinia concolor, commonly known as the smooth cousin, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and grayish-blue foliage that reflects sunlight, aiding in water conservation. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. Cousinia concolor is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
