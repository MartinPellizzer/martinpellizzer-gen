    "intro": "Cuscuta umbellata, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, hairless stems. The plant spreads by releasing seeds that germinate on the surface of host plants, attaching via specialized root-like structures called haustoria. It is found in various regions across North America and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, making it an ecologically significant but sometimes problematic species."
