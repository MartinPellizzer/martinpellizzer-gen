It is a clumping bamboo that typically grows in moist, temperate climates at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber. Chusquea intipaqariy plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions."
