    "intro": "Cestrum formosum, commonly known as the Chinese bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. These flowers are pollinated primarily by moths and bats, and the plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals. Cestrum formosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and nocturnal fragrance."
