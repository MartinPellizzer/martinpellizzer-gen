    "intro": "Cyanus germanicopolitanus, commonly known as the Germanic hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands, thriving in temperate climates. Its bright yellow flowers are surrounded by a ring of pale green ray florets, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Cyanus germanicopolitanus is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils."
