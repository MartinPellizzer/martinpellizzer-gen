    "intro": "Catapodium marinum subsp. syrticum, commonly known as the desert grass or sand couch, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a perennial grass that thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in coastal and desert environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
