    "intro": "Crataegus searsii, commonly known as the Sears hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters, featuring thorny branches and oval, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and mammals. Its botanical characteristics include simple, alternate leaves and a preference for well-drained soils in full sun. Crataegus searsii is often found in woodland edges and disturbed sites, contributing to local biodiversity."
