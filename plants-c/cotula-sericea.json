    "intro": "Cotula sericea, commonly known as silver cotula, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy, silver-gray leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Cotula sericea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
