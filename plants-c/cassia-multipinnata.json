    "intro": "Cassia multipinnata, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often trifoliate or pinnate, and its showy, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in pendulous clusters. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain flat, winged seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of medicinal compounds. Cassia multipinnata is also used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
