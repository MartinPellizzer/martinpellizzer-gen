    "intro": "Capsicum galapagoense, commonly known as the Galapagos pepper, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on the Galapagos Islands. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, elongated fruits that range in color from red to yellow. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has adapted to the unique environmental conditions of the islands. Its botanical features include hairy stems, lobed leaves, and flowers with five petals. Due to its restricted distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical and conservation studies."
