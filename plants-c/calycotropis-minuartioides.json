It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in rocky, arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are usually simple and ovate. It has a shallow root system adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains several seeds."
