    "intro": "Cousinia oligocephala, commonly known as the slender cousinia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows from a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cousinia oligocephala is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
