    "intro": "Calliphyllon latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf calliphyllon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It features basal rosettes of broad, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental foliage and ecological value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
