    "intro": "Cryptocarya mannii var. oahuensis, commonly known as the Oahu cryptocarya, is a rare endemic plant native to the island of Oahu in Hawaii. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels and avocado trees, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as mesic forests and rocky areas. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, it is considered vulnerable to extinction."
