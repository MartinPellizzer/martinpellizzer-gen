It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It is native to specific regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and distinct morphology, it is of interest to botanists and plant collectors."
