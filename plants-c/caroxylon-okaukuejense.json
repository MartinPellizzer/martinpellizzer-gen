    "intro": "Caroxylon okaukuejense, commonly known as the Okaukueje cedar, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the rainforests of western Africa. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, fibrous bark, which provides structural support and protection against pests. The plant exhibits a unique growth pattern, with a slow growth rate and a long lifespan, often exceeding several centuries. Its foliage consists of scale-like leaves arranged in spirals, typical of many conifer species. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Caroxylon okaukuejense is considered critically endangered, making it a subject of conservation interest."
