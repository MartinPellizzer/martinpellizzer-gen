    "intro": "Coronopus didymus f. incisus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heartworts, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as cabbages and mustard. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and its narrow, elongated leaves. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
