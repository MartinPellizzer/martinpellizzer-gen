    "intro": "Carduus edelbergii subsp. lanatus, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green leaves and spiny, purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid environments. Its subspecific name, *lanatus*, refers to the lanose (woolly) texture of its foliage. The woolly thistle plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
