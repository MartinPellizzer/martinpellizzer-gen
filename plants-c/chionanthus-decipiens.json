    "intro": "Chionanthus decipiens, commonly known as the false fringetree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves appear. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall, adding to its seasonal appeal. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Chionanthus decipiens is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
