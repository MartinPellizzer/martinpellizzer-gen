    "intro": "Cereus pterogonus, commonly known as the ghost plant or moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to the dry regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Cereus pterogonus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
