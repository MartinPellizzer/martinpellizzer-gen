    "intro": "Cedrela toona var. haslettii, commonly known as the Haslett's cedrela, is a tropical tree native to Central America. It belongs to the Meliaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, ovate leaves with a glossy upper surface. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by elongated, woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
