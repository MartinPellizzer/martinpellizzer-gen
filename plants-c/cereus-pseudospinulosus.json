    "intro": "Cereus pseudospinulosus, commonly known as the spiny night bloomer, is a cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are often sparsely covered with white spines. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its striking appearance and unique flowering habit, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and collections."
