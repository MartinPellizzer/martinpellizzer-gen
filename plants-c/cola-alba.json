    "intro": "Cola alba, commonly known as white cola nut, is a tropical plant native to West Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and showy white flowers. The plant produces capsules that contain seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a stimulant. Cola alba thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense tropical forests. Its botanical features make it distinct from other cola species, particularly in its pale floral and fruit characteristics."
