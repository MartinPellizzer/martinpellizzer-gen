    "intro": "Citharexylum ternatum, commonly known as the honeycomb tree, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive, fragrant, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, giving it a honeycomb-like appearance. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, with smooth, often greyish bark. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and usually have a leathery texture with a slightly waxy coating. The honeycomb tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
