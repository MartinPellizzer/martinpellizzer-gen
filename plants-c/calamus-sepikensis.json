    "intro": "Calamus sepikensis, commonly known as the Sepik reed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae. It is native to the wetlands and swampy areas of Papua New Guinea, particularly in the Sepik River region. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its rhizomes are sometimes harvested for their aromatic properties. Calamus sepikensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
