    "intro": "Copiapoa coquimbana subsp. coquimbana, commonly known as the Coquimbo copiapoa, is a cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces striking yellow flowers during the cool season, typically in spring. It is highly adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
