    "intro": "Calamus lambirensis, commonly known as the Lambirensis rattan, is a climbing palm native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its long, flexible stems used for making rattan furniture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by clustered, spiny fruits. It thrives in tropical rainforests and requires high humidity and indirect light. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
