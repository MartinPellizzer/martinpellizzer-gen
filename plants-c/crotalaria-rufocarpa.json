    "intro": "Crotalaria rufocarpa, commonly known as the red-barked crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom during the dry season. Its seeds are enclosed in pod-like fruits that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Crotalaria rufocarpa is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
