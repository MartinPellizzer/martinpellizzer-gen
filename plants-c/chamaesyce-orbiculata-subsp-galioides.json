    "intro": "Chamaesyce orbiculata subsp. galioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
