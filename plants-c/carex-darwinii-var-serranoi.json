    "intro": "Carex darwinii var. serranoi, commonly known as the Darwin's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, well-drained soil. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually green to brown in color, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. The varietal form serranoi is distinguished by its serrated leaf margins, adding to its botanical interest."
