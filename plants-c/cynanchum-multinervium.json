    "intro": "Cynanchum multinervium, commonly known as the Chinese milkweed vine, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, ovate leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by follicles containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in the understory of forests. Its latex contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans."
