    "intro": "Cattleya mooreana, commonly known as the Moore's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange with red or purple markings. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding substrate. Cattleya mooreana is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its vibrant blooms."
