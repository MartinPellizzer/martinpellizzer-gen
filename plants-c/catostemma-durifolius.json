    "intro": "Catostemma durifolius, commonly known as the hard-leaved catostemma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy, and often waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or yellowish in color. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
