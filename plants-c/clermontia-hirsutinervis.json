    "intro": "Clermontia hirsutinervis, commonly known as the hairy-veined clermontia, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale blue flowers. The leaves are usually hairy and have prominent veins, giving the plant its common name. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
