    "intro": "Clematis acuminata subsp. yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan Clematis, is a species native to China. It is a deciduous vine characterized by its slender stems and compound leaves. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for gardens in temperate climates. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in horticulture, though it remains less common than other clematis species."
