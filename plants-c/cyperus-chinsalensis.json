It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and is characterized by its triangular stems and small, three-ranked leaves. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, thriving in areas with standing water. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of tiny flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. Cyperus chinsalensis is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
