    "intro": "Crinum \u00d7 submersum, commonly known as the water lily crinum, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both Crinum and its aquatic relatives. It is a herbaceous perennial with showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. Its leaves are broad and arrowhead-shaped, often floating on the water's surface, while its roots form a dense network beneath the soil. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize aquatic ecosystems."
