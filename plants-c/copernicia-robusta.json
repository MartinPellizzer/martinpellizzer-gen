It is native to the northeastern regions of Brazil and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in branched inflorescences. Copernicia robusta is valued for its hard, durable palm wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. Additionally, it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
