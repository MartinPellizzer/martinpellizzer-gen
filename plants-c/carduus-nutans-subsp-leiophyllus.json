    "intro": "Carduus nutans subsp. leiophyllus, commonly known as the softleaf musk thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, pale green to bluish-gray leaves that are typically softer and more lobed than those of the typical Carduus nutans. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by spiny, globe-shaped seed heads. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and wastelands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
