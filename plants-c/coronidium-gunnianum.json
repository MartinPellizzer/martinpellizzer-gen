It is characterized by its striking white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single, showy flower per stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species."
