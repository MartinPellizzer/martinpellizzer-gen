    "intro": "Coryanthes barkeri, commonly known as the Barker's coryanthe, is a striking tropical orchid native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that often display vibrant red or orange hues with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are specialized for pollination by specific insects, particularly flies, which are attracted by the scent and color. The botanical structure of Coryanthes barkeri includes a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor habitats."
