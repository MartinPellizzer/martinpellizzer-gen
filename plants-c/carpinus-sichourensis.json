It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in catkins, which appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often with shallow fissures. Carpinus sichourensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and hardiness."
