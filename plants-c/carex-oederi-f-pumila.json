    "intro": "Carex oederi f. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a compact, low-growing plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. This variety is known for its dense, mat-forming growth habit, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, thriving in woodland environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, followed by distinctive three-sided seed capsules."
