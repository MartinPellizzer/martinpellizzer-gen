    "intro": "Caesalpinia homblei, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in dense, feathery clusters. The leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, thread-like leaflets, giving the plant a delicate appearance. The plant produces long, flat pods that contain several seeds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Caesalpinia homblei thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens in warm climates."
