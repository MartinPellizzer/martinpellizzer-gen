    "intro": "Chamaesyce cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The leaves are heart-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by distinctive, bead-like seed capsules. The plant is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
