    "intro": "Crataegus \u00d7 kyrtostyla nothovar. domicensis, commonly known as the domesticated hawthorn, is a hybrid plant resulting from crosses between different hawthorn species. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant typically produces small, white or pink flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries in the autumn. Its leaves are usually oval with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. This nothovar is valued for its hardiness and ability to provide habitat for wildlife."
