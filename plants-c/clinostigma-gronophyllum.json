    "intro": "Clinostigma gronophyllum, commonly known as the rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant features basal leaves that are lanceolate and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and arranged in clusters, adding to its ornamental value. Clinostigma gronophyllum is valued for its resilience and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
