    "intro": "Cheilanthes tenuifolia var. tenuissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, narrow, and often glaucous leaves that are adapted to conserve moisture in dry environments. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates, including limestone and sandstone, and is often found in crevices or on cliff faces. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the leaves, a common reproductive feature in ferns. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
