    "intro": "Cicendia quitensis, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous areas. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Cicendia quitensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
