    "intro": "Ceratostylis incognita, commonly known as the unknown horned-styled orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor in the soil while absorbing nutrients. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the orchid family."
