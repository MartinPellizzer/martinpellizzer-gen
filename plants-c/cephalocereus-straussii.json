    "intro": "Cephalocereus straussii, commonly known as the Strauss's torch cactus, is a columnar cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a tall, cylindrical stem with a ribbed structure that helps it store water efficiently. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the night, which are pollinated by bats and other nocturnal insects. Its spines are typically light-colored and provide protection against herbivores. This species is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a hardy and striking addition to arid landscapes."
