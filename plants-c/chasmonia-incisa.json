    "intro": "Chasmonia incisa, commonly known as the desert aster, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows from 10 to 30 centimeters in height, with narrow, hairy leaves adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers bloom in shades of yellow to orange, often appearing in late summer or early autumn. Chasmonia incisa plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides."
