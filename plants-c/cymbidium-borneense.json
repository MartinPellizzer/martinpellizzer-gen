    "intro": "Cymbidium borneense, commonly known as the Borneo orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the island of Borneo. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect pseudobulbs and long, narrow leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the rainforests of Borneo. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, Cymbidium borneense is considered a vulnerable species."
