It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers, squash, and gourds. The plant is characterized by its slender, vine-like structure and small, pale green, edible fruits. It thrives in the humid, tropical climate of the Western Ghats, where it plays a vital role in the local ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental degradation and habitat loss."
