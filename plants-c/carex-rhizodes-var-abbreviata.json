    "intro": "Carex rhizodes var. abbreviata, commonly known as the short-stemmed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along streams. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are often reddish in color. This variety is distinguished by its shorter stems and reduced leaf blades compared to the typical form of Carex rhizodes."
