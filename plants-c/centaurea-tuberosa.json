    "intro": "Centaurea tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous centaurea, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking blue to purple flower heads that resemble those of other centaurea species. The plant produces tuberous roots, which are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers consist of both ray and disk florets. Centaurea tuberosa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky habitats."
