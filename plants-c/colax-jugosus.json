    "intro": "Colax jugosus, commonly known as the tropical milk tree, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers are small and clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family, and are usually greenish-yellow in color."
