    "intro": "Claoxylon sandwicense var. hillebrandtii, commonly known as the Hillebrandt's sandwicense. It is a rare, small tree endemic to the Hawaiian Islands, specifically found on the island of Maui. The plant is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody fruits containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
