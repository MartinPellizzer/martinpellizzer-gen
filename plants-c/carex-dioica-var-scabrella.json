    "intro": "Carex dioica var. scabrella, commonly known as the scabrous sedges, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a distinctive scabrous texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing both male and female flowers, which are typically separated into different spikes. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
