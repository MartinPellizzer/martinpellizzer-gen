    "intro": "Craibia bequaertii, commonly known as the Guiana Shield tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the rainforests of South America, particularly in Guyana and Suriname. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and produces showy, yellow-orange flowers. It is often found in moist, shaded environments within the understory of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Craibia bequaertii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
