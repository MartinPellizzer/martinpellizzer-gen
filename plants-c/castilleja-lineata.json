    "intro": "Castilleja lineata, commonly known as the slender Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for nutrients, often growing on grasses or shrubs. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to the roots of host plants. Castilleja lineata is an important component of its ecosystem, supporting pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
