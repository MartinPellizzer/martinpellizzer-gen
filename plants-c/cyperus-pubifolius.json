    "intro": "Cyperus pubifolius, commonly known as the hairy leaf flatsedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Cyperus pubifolius produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are usually wind-pollinated. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
