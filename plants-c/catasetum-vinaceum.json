    "intro": "Catasetum vinaceum, commonly known as the red orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, often vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers have a unique structure with a specialized lip that aids in pollination by specific bees. Catasetum vinaceum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or warm climates."
