    "intro": "Carex festiva, commonly known as the festive sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, rushes, and other grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are usually dark green, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the spring. Carex festiva is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
