It typically grows to a height of less than 10 inches, with dense, leathery foliage that is gray-green in color. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suited to Mediterranean climates. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
