    "intro": "Caularthron indivisum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and gravelly soils, and is adapted to arid environments. It has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with stems that often lie close to the ground. Caularthron indivisum is often found in coastal and inland deserts, where it contributes to the local flora's resilience in harsh conditions."
