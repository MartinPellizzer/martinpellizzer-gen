    "intro": "Cypripedium luteum var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yellow lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features a distinctive, pouch-like lip that is typically yellow or orange, which serves as a lure for pollinators. The plant has a single, upright stem that bears a single, showy flower with sepals and petals that are often white or pale yellow. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, contributing to its elegant appearance. This orchid is known for its delicate beauty and is often found in moist, shaded habitats within temperate forests."
