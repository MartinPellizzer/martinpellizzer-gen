    "intro": "Collaea rosea, commonly known as the pink fairy tern, is a small flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in coastal dunes and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to habitat loss, Collaea rosea is considered endangered and is protected under New Zealand's conservation laws."
