    "intro": "Cyathea convergens, commonly known as the broad-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, rough-textured cortex. The plant produces large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Cyathea convergens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its unique morphology makes it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture."
