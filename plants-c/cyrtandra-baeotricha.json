    "intro": "Cyrtandra baeotricha, commonly known as the hairy cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with opposite, ovate leaves that have a hairy texture. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their nectar-rich structure. Cyrtandra baeotricha is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky crevices."
