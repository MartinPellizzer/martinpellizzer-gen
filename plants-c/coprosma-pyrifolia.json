    "intro": "Coprosma pyrifolia, commonly known as the flame tree or fire tree, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its striking, flame-like inflorescences that appear in late summer to early autumn. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves with prominent veins and produces small, fleshy, orange-red berries that are an important food source for native birds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Coprosma pyrifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
