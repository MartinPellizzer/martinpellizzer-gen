    "intro": "Centaurea jeffreyana, commonly known as Jeffrey's knapweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and open woodlands, and is adapted to arid environments. Its bright yellow to orange flowers bloom in summer, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Centaurea jeffreyana is often found in disturbed areas and can be an indicator of soil conditions in its native range."
