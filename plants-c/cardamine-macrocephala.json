    "intro": "Cardamine macrocephala, commonly known as the large-headed watercress, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, alternate leaves that are usually heart-shaped or rounded. Its flowers are white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and are followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. The species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to that of watercress."
