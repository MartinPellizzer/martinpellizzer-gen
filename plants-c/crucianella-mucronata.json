    "intro": "Crucianella mucronata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sea bean, is a small flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Leguminosae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, adapting to saline and well-drained conditions. Its flowers are small and white or pale green, often appearing in clusters, while the seeds are enclosed in elongated, fibrous pods. Crucianella mucronata plays a minor role in local ecosystems, providing habitat and food for small invertebrates."
