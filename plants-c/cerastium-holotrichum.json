It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a serrated edge, and the plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Cerastium holotrichum is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas, making it a common sight in temperate regions."
