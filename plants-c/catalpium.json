    "intro": "Catalpium, commonly known as the catalpa tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bignoniaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico, where it thrives in warm climates. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer. Catalpium trees are often cultivated for their ornamental value and can grow up to 30 meters tall. The fruit is a long, cylindrical pod that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural spread."
