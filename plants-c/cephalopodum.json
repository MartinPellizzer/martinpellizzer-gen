    "intro": "Cephalopodum, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow or orange flowers. The plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects. Cephalopodum is often used as a ground cover due to its dense growth habit and hardiness. Its seeds are small and oval, typically dispersed by wind or animals."
