    "intro": "Cytisus laburnum var. bullatum, commonly known as the golden laburnum, is a shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its bright yellow, pea-like flowers that appear in early summer. The plant has slender, woody stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it is toxic to livestock due to the presence of cytisine in its seeds and foliage."
