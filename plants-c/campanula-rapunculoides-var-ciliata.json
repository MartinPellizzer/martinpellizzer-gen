    "intro": "Campanula rapunculoides var. ciliata, commonly known as the hairy bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features basal rosettes of hairy, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are characterized by their ciliate (fringed) margins, which give the variety its scientific name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows."
