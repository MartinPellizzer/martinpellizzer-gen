    "intro": "Cucubalus alpinus, commonly known as the alpine cucumber, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other cucurbits like cucumbers and melons. The plant is characterized by its trailing growth habit, heart-shaped leaves, and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its fruits are small, elongated, and resemble cucumbers, though they are typically bitter and not widely cultivated for consumption. Due to its preference for cool, high-altitude environments, it is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas."
