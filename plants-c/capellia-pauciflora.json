It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to arid conditions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to white, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits known as achenes. Capellia pauciflora is noted for its low-growing habit and is often found in open, sunny environments."
