    "intro": "Clowesia dodsoniana, commonly known as the Hawaiian moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as rainforests and has a trailing or climbing habit. Its leaves are ovate with a hairy texture, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that contain seeds. Due to its restricted habitat and rarity, it is considered an endangered species."
