    "intro": "Campanula pusilla var. foliosa, commonly known as the leafy bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compact, rosette-forming leaves that are typically broader and more pronounced than those of the typical Campanula pusilla. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate flowers and foliage, which add a subtle yet charming presence to gardens."
