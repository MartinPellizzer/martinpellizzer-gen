    "intro": "Corydalis balansae, commonly known as the Balansae Corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in the botanical world."
