    "intro": "Cyathea pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact stature, typically growing to a height of less than two meters. The plant features a short, fibrous trunk covered with remnants of its old fronds, which give it a distinctive appearance. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a dark green color and a velvety texture. Cyathea pumilio thrives in humid, shaded environments and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats."
