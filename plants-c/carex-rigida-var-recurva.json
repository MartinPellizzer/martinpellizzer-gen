    "intro": "Carex rigida var. recurva, commonly known as the recurved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist soils in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly curled at the tips, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and requires consistent moisture, making it a valuable addition to wetland restoration projects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
