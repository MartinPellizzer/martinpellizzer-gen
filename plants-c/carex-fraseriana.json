    "intro": "Carex fraseriana, commonly known as Fraser's sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist to wet environments such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. It has small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, and it produces three-sided, three-rowed seeds. Carex fraseriana is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
