It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
