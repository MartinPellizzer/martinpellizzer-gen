    "intro": "Cardamine amara var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shadowy watercress, is a variant of the watercress species native to shaded, moist environments. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or stream-side habitats, where it thrives in cool, damp conditions. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor, similar to other watercress varieties. Due to its preference for shaded areas, it is often found in forest understories or along the edges of water bodies."
