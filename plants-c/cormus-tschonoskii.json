    "intro": "Cormus tschonoskii, commonly known as the Tschonoskii corm, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its underground corm, which serves as a storage organ and is essential for its survival. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
