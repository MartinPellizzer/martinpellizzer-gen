    "intro": "Coelogyne loheri, commonly known as the Loher's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescence and vibrant, often fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive dry periods. Coelogyne loheri is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its unique floral display."
