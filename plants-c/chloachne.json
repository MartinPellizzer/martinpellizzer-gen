    "intro": "Chloachne, commonly known as the silver grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence on the leaf blades. The plants typically grow in moist, well-drained soils and are often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Chloachne species are perennial and can form dense clumps, making them useful for erosion control in wetland habitats. Their small, inconspicuous flowers are usually arranged in panicles and bloom in late spring to early summer."
