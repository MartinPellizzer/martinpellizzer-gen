These plants are native to the western Mediterranean region and are characterized by their small, fragrant, bell-shaped flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, forming a dense rosette at the base. Chamaecrinum species are perennial herbs that thrive in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are relatively easy to grow in garden settings."
