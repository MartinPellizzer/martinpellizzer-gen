    "intro": "Cheilanthes pubescens, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its hairy, dark green fronds. The plant thrives in rocky, arid environments and is often found in crevices or on cliffs. Its spores are released from terminal clusters on the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiaceae family. Cheilanthes pubescens is relatively drought-tolerant and has adapted to survive in harsh, semi-desert conditions."
