    "intro": "Coriflora hirsutissima, commonly known as the hairy coriflora, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are broad and covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers, which bloom in spring, are usually white or pale yellow and attract various pollinators."
