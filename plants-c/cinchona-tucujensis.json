    "intro": "Cinchona tucujensis, commonly known as the Tucuj\u00e9n cinchona, is a species of shrub native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that contain seeds, and it is often found in moist, shaded habitats at elevations between 1,200 and 2,500 meters. While not as widely cultivated as other cinchona species, it holds ecological significance in its native range."
