    "intro": "Cuscuta odorata var. botryoides, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has thread-like stems that wrap around its host to establish a connection. The plant is often found on crops such as wheat, barley, and corn, causing significant agricultural damage. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can thrive in a variety of environments. The botanical study of this species is important for understanding parasitic plant ecology and managing its impact on agriculture."
