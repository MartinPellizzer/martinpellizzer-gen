    "intro": "Colchicum todaroi, commonly known as the Todaroi meadow saffron, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It produces striking, violet-blue flowers with curled petals that bloom in late summer. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a short, sturdy stem. Its bulbs contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous if ingested. Despite its toxicity, it is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine."
