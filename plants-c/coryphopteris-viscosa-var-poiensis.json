    "intro": "Coryphopteris viscosa var. poiensis, commonly known as the Poiensis tree fern, is a tropical fern native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in rainforest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, providing structural support and facilitating nutrient absorption. The species is noted for its slow growth and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in tropical gardens."
