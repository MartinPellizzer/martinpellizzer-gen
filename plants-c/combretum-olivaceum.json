    "intro": "Combretum olivaceum, commonly known as the olive bush, is a deciduous shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Combretum olivaceum is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
