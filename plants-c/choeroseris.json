    "intro": "Choeroseris, commonly known as the dandelion-like composite plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their yellow composite flowers, which consist of many tiny florets arranged in a circular pattern. The leaves are typically basal, forming a rosette and often have a hairy or toothed appearance. Choeroseris species are native to various regions of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and many are found in arid or semi-arid environments. They are often considered weeds but have historical uses in traditional medicine and as a food source."
