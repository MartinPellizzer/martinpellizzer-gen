    "intro": "Cheilanthes \u00d7 prototinaei, commonly known as the hybrid rock fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cheilanthes tamariscina and Cheilanthes prototinaei. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in rocky or crevice habitats, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features a compact, cushion-like growth form with small, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a characteristic feature of the Polypodiaceae family. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to challenging soils."
