    "intro": "Carex filipendula var. variegata, commonly known as variegated sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage, which features a striking variegation of green and white or yellow markings. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, consist of small, clustered flowers that are often green or reddish in color. The variegated leaves make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in water features and bog gardens."
