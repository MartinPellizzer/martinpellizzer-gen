    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris f. gynodioeca, commonly known as the female-sterile form of heather, is a variant of the common heather. It is characterized by its reduced floral structure, where only female reproductive organs are present, making it self-incompatible. This form typically exhibits smaller, more clustered flowers compared to the typical form. It is often found in the same habitats as the standard Calluna vulgaris, such as acidic soils in heathlands. The botanical interest in this form lies in its role in plant breeding and its implications for reproductive biology."
