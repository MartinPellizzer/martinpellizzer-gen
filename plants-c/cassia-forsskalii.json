    "intro": "Cassia forsskalii, commonly known as the desert cassia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces elongated pods that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and waxy leaves to reduce water loss. Cassia forsskalii is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dye."
