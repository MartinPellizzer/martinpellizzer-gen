    "intro": "Colchicum exiguum subsp. vogelii, commonly known as the dwarf autumn crocus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Colchicaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, this subspecies thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces toxic alkaloids, particularly colchicine, which has historically been used in medicine and research. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
