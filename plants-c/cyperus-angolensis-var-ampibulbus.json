    "intro": "Cyperus angolensis var. ampibulbus, commonly known as the broad-leaved flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, thriving in shallow water or moist soil. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a dense, cylindrical cluster, which is a typical feature of sedges. The species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
