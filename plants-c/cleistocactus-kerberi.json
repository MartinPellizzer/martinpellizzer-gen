    "intro": "Cleistocactus kerberi, commonly known as the \"Moon Cactus,\" is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom at night, a trait that aids in pollination by nocturnal insects. Its unique appearance, with a bright, colorful top and a green, columnar base, makes it a popular ornamental plant. Due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance, it is well-suited for indoor cultivation."
