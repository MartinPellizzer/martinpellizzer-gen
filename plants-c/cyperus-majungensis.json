    "intro": "Cyperus majungensis, commonly known as the Majungensis flatsedge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the grass family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, preferring moist and well-drained soils. Its flowering spikes are usually clustered at the base of the plant, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Cyperus majungensis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
