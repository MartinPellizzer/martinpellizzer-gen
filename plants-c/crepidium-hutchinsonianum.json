    "intro": "Crepidium hutchinsonianum, commonly known as the Hutchinson's pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, narrow leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. Its flowers are clustered in racemes and are often pollinated by small insects. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
