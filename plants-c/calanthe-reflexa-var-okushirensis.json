    "intro": "Calanthe reflexa var. okushirensis, commonly known as the Okushiro calanthe, is a rare and delicate orchid native to Japan. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves and its striking, pale pink to white flowers with a distinctive reflexed lip. This variety thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its blooming period typically occurs in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
