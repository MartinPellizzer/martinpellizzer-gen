    "intro": "Ctenopteris truncicola, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sea holly, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and often serrated fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in coastal and brackish water environments, making it well adapted to saline conditions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Ctenopteris truncicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
