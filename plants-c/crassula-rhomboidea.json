    "intro": "Crassula rhomboidea, commonly known as the diamond plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, triangular leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially in response to sunlight. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
