    "intro": "Chiropetalum tricuspidatum, commonly known as the three-lobed bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with three distinct lobes, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of botanical circles."
