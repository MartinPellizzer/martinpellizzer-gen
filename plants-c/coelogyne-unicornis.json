    "intro": "Coelogyne unicornis, commonly known as the unicorn orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, strap-like leaves and produces striking, fragrant flowers with a single, elongated bloom resembling a horn, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive yellow lip. Coelogyne unicornis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
