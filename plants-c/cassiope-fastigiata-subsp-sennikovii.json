    "intro": "Cassiope fastigiata subsp. sennikovii, commonly known as the Sennikov's mountain heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are arranged in a compact, cushion-like form, adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens and conservation programs."
