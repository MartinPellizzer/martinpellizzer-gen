    "intro": "Cystea fragilis, commonly known as the glassy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves that can appear as hollow, bladder-like structures. This plant is typically found in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands. Cystea fragilis is known for its ability to float on the water's surface, supported by its specialized air-filled cells. Its botanical features make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems, contributing to water oxygenation and serving as habitat for small aquatic organisms."
