    "intro": "Codia incrassata, commonly known as the rough-leaved codia, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in small, raised bumps. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fruit that splits open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in warm climates."
