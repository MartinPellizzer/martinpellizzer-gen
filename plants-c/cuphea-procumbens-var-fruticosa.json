It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that produces clusters of showy, tubular red flowers. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces, and its stems are often covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native gardens."
