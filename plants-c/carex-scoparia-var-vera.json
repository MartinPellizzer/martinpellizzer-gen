    "intro": "Carex scoparia var. vera, commonly known as the slender sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, three-lobed flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It has rhizomatous growth and can form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Its botanical features make it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments."
