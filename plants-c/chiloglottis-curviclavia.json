    "intro": "Chiloglottis curviclavia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf duckbill, is an epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dark green, narrow leaves and distinctive, downward-curving, pinkish-brown flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are adapted for pollination by small insects. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
