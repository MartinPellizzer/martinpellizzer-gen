    "intro": "Copernicia sanctae-martae, commonly known as the Santa Marta copernicia, is a species of palm native to the Caribbean island of Santa Marta. It is a small, slender palm with a single trunk and pinnate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by clustered, oval-shaped fruits. It is adapted to grow in humid, coastal environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
