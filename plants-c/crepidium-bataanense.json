    "intro": "Crepidium bataanense, commonly known as the Bataan orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
