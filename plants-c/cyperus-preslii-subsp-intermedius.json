    "intro": "Cyperus preslii subsp. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate flatsedge, is a perennial herb native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in wetland habitats. Its botanical features make it adaptable to a variety of moist environments, contributing to its widespread distribution."
