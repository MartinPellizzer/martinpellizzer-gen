    "intro": "Calamagrostis glacialis, commonly known as the alpine sweetgrass, is a perennial grass native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, silver-green foliage and tufted inflorescences that bloom in late summer. This plant thrives in cold, moist environments such as alpine meadows and tundra, often growing in rocky or well-drained soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in harsh conditions. Calamagrostis glacialis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
