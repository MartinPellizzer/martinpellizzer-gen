    "intro": "Clematis subfalcata var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clematis, is a perennial vine native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, climbing stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically narrow and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces showy, actinomorphic flowers in late summer, usually in shades of blue or purple, which are borne in clusters at the base of the leaves. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, silky pubescence, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is well-suited to rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
