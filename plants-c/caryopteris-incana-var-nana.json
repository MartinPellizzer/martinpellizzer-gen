    "intro": "Caryopteris incana var. nana, commonly known as dwarf blue mistflower, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features aromatic, silver-gray foliage that turns bluish-green in full sun, with small, tubular blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for landscape use. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
