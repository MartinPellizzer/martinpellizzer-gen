    "intro": "Centaurea montana var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf mountain bluemink, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, upright stems and produces striking cobalt-blue to purple flower heads that resemble small mink-like tails. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is often found in rocky soils and open meadows, thriving in full sun and cool climates."
