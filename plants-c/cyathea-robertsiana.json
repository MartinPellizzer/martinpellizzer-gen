    "intro": "Cyathea robertsiana, commonly known as the Roberts' tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, providing structural support and aiding in nutrient absorption. The fronds are bi-directionally arranged, with a distinctive midrib and serrated leaflets."
