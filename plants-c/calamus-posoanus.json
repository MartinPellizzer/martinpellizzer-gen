    "intro": "Calamus posoanus, commonly known as the Poso cane, is a member of the Aroid family (Araceae) and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to several meters in height, often used for making bamboo-like products. The plant produces large, leafy shoots that emerge from the base, with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Aroid family. Calamus posoanus is valued not only for its utility but also for its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens."
