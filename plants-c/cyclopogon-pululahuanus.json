    "intro": "Cyclopogon pululahuanus, commonly known as the Pululahua cyclopogon, is a rare plant species native to the Andes Mountains in Ecuador. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure. The plant produces striking orange-red inflorescences that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
