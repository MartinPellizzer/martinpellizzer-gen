    "intro": "Corydalis diphylla var. cyrtocentra, commonly known as the narrow-leaved corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has two distinct leaf forms, with the lower leaves being broader and the upper ones more narrow, a feature that gives it its specific name. It prefers well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in woodland or forested areas. Corydalis diphylla var. cyrtocentra is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is relatively easy to cultivate in cooler climates."
