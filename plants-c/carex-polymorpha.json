    "intro": "Carex polymorpha, commonly known as variable sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown, arranged in spikelets. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, bogs, and along streambanks. Carex polymorpha is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
