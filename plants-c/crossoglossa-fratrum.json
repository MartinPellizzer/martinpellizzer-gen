    "intro": "Crossoglossa fratrum, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Himalayas, is a rare aquatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of Nepal and Bhutan. It is characterized by its striking white flowers that bloom in late summer, often surrounded by thick, waxy leaves that help it float on water. The plant thrives in still, nutrient-rich waters and is adapted to the cold, high-altitude climate. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it to the lakebed, while its leaves are often covered in a layer of fine hair. Crossoglossa fratrum is not only a botanical curiosity but also holds cultural significance in local traditions."
