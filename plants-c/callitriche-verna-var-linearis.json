    "intro": "Callitriche verna var. linearis, commonly known as early water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow water, wet meadows, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has narrow, linear leaves arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a delicate, star-like appearance. It produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring. This variety is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats and is valued for its ecological role in supporting aquatic life."
