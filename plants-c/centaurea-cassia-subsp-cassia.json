It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has spiny stems and leaves with a rough, hairy texture. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its invasive nature in some areas, it is considered a noxious weed in parts of North America."
