    "intro": "Cousinia orthacantha, commonly known as the stonecress, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. The plant has hairy, grayish leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Cousinia orthacantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
