    "intro": "Cinchona luciana, commonly known as the Peruvian bark or quina quina, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its evergreen, woody stems and large, elliptical leaves with a waxy surface. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries containing seeds. Cinchona luciana is notable for its historical use in the production of quinine, a compound used to treat malaria."
