    "intro": "Cladocolea \u00d7 kuijtii, commonly known as the hybrid rockrose, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Fabaceae. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Cladocolea paniculata and Cladocolea tetragona, both native to South Africa. The plant is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or white. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated by gardeners interested in native and hybrid plants."
