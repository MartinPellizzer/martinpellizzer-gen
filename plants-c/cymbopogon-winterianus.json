    "intro": "Cymbopogon winterianus, commonly known as citronella, is a perennial grass native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, pale green flowers in dense clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Citronella is widely cultivated for its essential oils, which are extracted from its leaves and used in perfumes, food flavoring, and as a natural insect repellent. Its botanical features make it both ecologically and economically significant in various regions."
