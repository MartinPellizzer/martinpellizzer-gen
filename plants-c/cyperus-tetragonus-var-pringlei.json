    "intro": "Cyperus tetragonus var. pringlei, commonly known as the narrowleaf spikerush, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, making it a common species in marshy environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Cyperus tetragonus var. pringlei plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
