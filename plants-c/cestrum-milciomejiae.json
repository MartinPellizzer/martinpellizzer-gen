It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its berries, which are orange-red when mature, contain toxic compounds and are not edible. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
