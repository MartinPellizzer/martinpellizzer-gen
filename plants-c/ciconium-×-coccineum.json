    "intro": "Ciconium \u00d7 coccineum, commonly known as the red ciconium, is a hybrid plant that combines traits from its parent species. It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Acanthaceae, characterized by its striking red bracts that resemble flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture. The red bracts are not true flowers but serve as modified leaves, attracting pollinators to the small, inconspicuous actual flowers."
