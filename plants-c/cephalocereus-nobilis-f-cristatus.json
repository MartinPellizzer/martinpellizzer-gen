    "intro": "Cephalocereus nobilis f. cristatus, commonly known as the cristate organ pipe cactus, is a unique variation of the organ pipe cactus characterized by its flattened, branching growth pattern. This plant is native to the Sonoran Desert and thrives in arid environments with well-draining soil. Its most striking feature is the formation of \"crista,\" which results from a mutation causing the stems to grow in a fan-like shape. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is relatively low maintenance but requires careful watering to avoid root rot."
