    "intro": "Cardamine armoracioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved watercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its finely divided, alternate leaves that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-rich, wet soils, often found in stream banks and marshes. The species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to that of watercress."
