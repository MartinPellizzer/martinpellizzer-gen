    "intro": "Cristaria hastata, commonly known as the narrowleaf water shield, is a aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves that are partially submerged, with the upper surfaces often covered in a waxy coating. Its small, white flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces small, dark seeds that are dispersed by water. Cristaria hastata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
