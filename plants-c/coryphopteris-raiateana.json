    "intro": "Coryphopteris raiateana, commonly known as the Tahitian tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizome system supports the growth of its tall, woody stem, while the fronds are responsible for photosynthesis. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various organisms."
