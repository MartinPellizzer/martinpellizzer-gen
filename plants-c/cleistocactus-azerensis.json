    "intro": "Cleistocactus azerensis, commonly known as the Azeri closed-cactus, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Azerbaijan. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows to a height of about 10 centimeters. The plant produces yellow flowers that open only at night, a characteristic feature of its nocturnal blooming habit. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
