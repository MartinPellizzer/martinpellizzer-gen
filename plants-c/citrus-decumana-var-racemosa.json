It is characterized by its elongated, yellow-orange fruit that is typically smaller than the standard citron. The plant produces clusters of flowers, giving it the \"racemosa\" designation, which refers to its racemose inflorescence. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin. The fruit is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine and culinary applications."
