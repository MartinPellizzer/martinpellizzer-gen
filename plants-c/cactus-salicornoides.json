    "intro": "Cactus salicornoides, commonly known as the sea hedgehog, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a dense cluster of spiny, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant's stems are typically green or bluish-green, with small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. It produces small yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a subtle ornamental value. The plant's structure and adaptations make it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens in hot, dry climates."
