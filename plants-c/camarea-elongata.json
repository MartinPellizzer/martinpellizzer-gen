    "intro": "Camarea elongata, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps over time. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in its survival by deterring herbivores."
