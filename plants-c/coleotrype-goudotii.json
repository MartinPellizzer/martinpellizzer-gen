    "intro": "Coleotrype goudotii, commonly known as the golden star mushroom, is a species of fungus characterized by its distinctive yellowish-orange cap and white gills. It belongs to the family Tricholomataceae and is typically found in forested areas, particularly in association with decaying wood. The fruiting bodies are usually small, with a central bump or umbo on the cap surface. It is a saprophytic fungus, playing a role in decomposing organic matter in its habitat. Due to its unique appearance, it is sometimes mistaken for other edible mushrooms, requiring careful identification to avoid confusion."
