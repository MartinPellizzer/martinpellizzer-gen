    "intro": "Cremastosperma, commonly known as the \"spiny antelope's foot,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The genus includes several species, many of which are native to Africa and parts of Asia. Cremastosperma species often have woody stems and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. They play a role in local ecosystems and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
