    "intro": "Chrysanthemoides monilifera subsp. rotundata, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its yellow floral heads and feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant thrives in coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer. This subspecies is often used in coastal rehabilitation projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes."
