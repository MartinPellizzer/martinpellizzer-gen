    "intro": "Clutia sericea, commonly known as silky clutia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and simple, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Clutia sericea is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks, and it has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
