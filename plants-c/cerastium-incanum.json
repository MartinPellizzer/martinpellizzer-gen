    "intro": "Cerastium incanum, commonly known as the whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features prostrate or ascending stems that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a frosty appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are usually opposite, ovate, and hairy, contributing to its overall delicate appearance. Cerastium incanum is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in moist, well-drained conditions."
