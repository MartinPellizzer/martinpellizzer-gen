    "intro": "Chamaecytisus pineticola, commonly known as the purple broom, is a flowering shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small, leathery, and often have a reddish or purplish hue, contributing to its ornamental value. Chamaecytisus pineticola is well adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats."
