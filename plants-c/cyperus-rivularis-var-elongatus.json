    "intro": "Cyperus rivularis var. elongatus, commonly known as the elongated flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to submerged soil conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often greenish or brownish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that can dominate wetland habitats. Cyperus rivularis var. elongatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
