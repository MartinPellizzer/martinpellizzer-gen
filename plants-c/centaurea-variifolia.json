    "intro": "Centaurea variifolia, commonly known as variable centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, spiky seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Centaurea variifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
