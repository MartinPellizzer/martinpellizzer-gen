    "intro": "Cerastium murale, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky or disturbed soils and is often found in woodland edges or along pathways. Cerastium murale is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
