    "intro": "Cheiridopsis quaternifolia, commonly known as the four-leafed ice plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the winter months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
