    "intro": "Centaurea leucophaea, commonly known as the white-centred knapweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with a distinctive white center, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine down, contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas."
