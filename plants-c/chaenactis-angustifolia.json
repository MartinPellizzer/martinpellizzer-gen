It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or arid environments. Its narrow, linear leaves are arranged oppositely along the stem, and it produces showy yellow to orange flowers. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native habitat."
