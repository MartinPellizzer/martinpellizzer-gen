    "intro": "Clibadium appressipilum, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rapid growth and ornamental flowers make it both a popular garden plant and a potential invasive species in some regions."
