    "intro": "Cola macrantha, commonly known as the African cola tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to West Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that develop into hard, woody pods containing several seeds. Cola macrantha is notable for its caffeine content, similar to other cola species, and is often cultivated for its seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a stimulant. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species in its native range."
