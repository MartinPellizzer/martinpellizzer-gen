    "intro": "Calamagrostis autumnalis subsp. autumnalis, commonly known as autumn calamagrass, is a tall grass species native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and slender, silver-green leaves that turn golden in the fall. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for wetland gardens and ecological restoration projects."
