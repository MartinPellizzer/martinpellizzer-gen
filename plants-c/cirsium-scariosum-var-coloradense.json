It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and showy purple to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are covered in a whitish, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
