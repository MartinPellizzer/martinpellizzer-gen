It features compact, rounded rosettes of fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires ample sunlight to maintain its vibrant coloration. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscape designs."
