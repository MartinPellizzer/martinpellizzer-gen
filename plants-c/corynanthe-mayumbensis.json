    "intro": "Corynanthe mayumbensis, commonly known as the Mayumb\u00e9 corynane, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers. It produces small, round berries that are typically red when ripe. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and understudied species."
