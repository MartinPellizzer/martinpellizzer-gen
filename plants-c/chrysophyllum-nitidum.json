    "intro": "Chrysophyllum nitidum, commonly known as the glossy apple or sweet apple tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and showy, fragrant yellow flowers. The tree produces small, round fruits with a smooth, shiny skin and a sweet, edible pulp. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of food, though its fruit is not as widely consumed as other members of its genus."
