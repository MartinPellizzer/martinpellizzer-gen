    "intro": "Chthamalia nummularia, commonly known as the pennywort, is a small, green algal species that forms dense, circular mats on rocky substrates in marine environments. It thrives in intertidal zones, where it is exposed to fluctuating salinity and temperature conditions. The plant's thallus is typically flat and disc-shaped, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal sediments and providing habitat for small marine organisms. Chthamalia nummularia is often found in association with other algae and is an indicator species for certain types of rocky shores."
