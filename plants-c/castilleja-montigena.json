    "intro": "Castilleja montigena, commonly known as the mountain paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on a root system to absorb water and nutrients from its host plants. Castilleja montigena often grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
