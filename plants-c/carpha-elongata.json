    "intro": "Carpha elongata, commonly known as the tall flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a tight, grass-like formation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters called spikes, which are usually green or brown in color. Carpha elongata is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
