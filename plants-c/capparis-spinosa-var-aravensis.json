    "intro": "Capparis spinosa var. aravensis, commonly known as the Arava caper, is a variant of the caper plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a shrub characterized by its thorny stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces green, edible buds that are harvested before they open, similar to other caper varieties. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Its botanical features make it a hardy and resilient plant suitable for xeriscaping and sustainable gardening."
