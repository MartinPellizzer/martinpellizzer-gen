    "intro": "Coelogyne crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leafed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with a distinctive red or purple lip. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. Coelogyne crassifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and resilience in cultivation."
