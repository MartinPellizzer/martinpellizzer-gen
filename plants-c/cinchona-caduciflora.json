    "intro": "Cinchona caduciflora, commonly known as the white cinchona, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and quinine-producing species. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at high altitudes. The bark of this plant has been studied for its potential medicinal properties, though it is less commercially exploited than other cinchona species."
