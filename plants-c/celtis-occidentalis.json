    "intro": "Celtis occidentalis, commonly known as the American boxelder, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It belongs to the Ulmaceae family and is characterized by its alternate, palmately compound leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by samaroid fruits, which are winged and dispersed by wind. It typically grows in a variety of habitats, including riparian zones and open woodlands. The bark is smooth when young and becomes fissured with age, adding to its distinctive appearance."
