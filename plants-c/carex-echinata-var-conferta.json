It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, cylindrical spikelets that are often reddish or purplish in color. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in wetland restoration projects. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with male and female flowers usually occurring on separate spikes."
