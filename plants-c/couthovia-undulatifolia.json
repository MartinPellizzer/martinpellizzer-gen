    "intro": "Couthovia undulatifolia, commonly known as the wavy-leaf fern, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its delicate, undulating fronds. Native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia, it thrives in shaded, moist environments with high humidity. The plant features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically bi-colored, with a pale underside that contrasts with the darker upper surface. Couthovia undulatifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value in both indoor and outdoor gardens."
