    "intro": "Carex capillaris var. major, commonly known as the tall sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
