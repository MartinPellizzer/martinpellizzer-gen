    "intro": "Cyathodes tameiameiae var. societas, commonly known as the Sociedades Cyathodes, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, characterized by its distinctive cyathium inflorescence, which is a specialized structure composed of a cup-like involucrum surrounding the reproductive organs. The plant features small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, with prominent bracteoles that serve both protective and attractive functions. Its foliage is typically alternate and ovate, with a smooth texture and a slightly glossy appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
