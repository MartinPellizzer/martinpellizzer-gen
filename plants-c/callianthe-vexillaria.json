    "intro": "Callianthe vexillaria, commonly known as the waxflower of the Andes, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, waxy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found in alpine meadows. Callianthe vexillaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
