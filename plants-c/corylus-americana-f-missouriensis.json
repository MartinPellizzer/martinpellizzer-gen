    "intro": "Corylus americana f. missouriensis, commonly known as the Missouri hazelnut, is a subspecies of the American hazelnut native to the central United States. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces catkin-like male flowers and female flowers in separate clusters, followed by edible, nut-like fruits enclosed in a prickly husk. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and streamside habitats. The Missouri hazelnut is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for wildlife and supporting local biodiversity."
