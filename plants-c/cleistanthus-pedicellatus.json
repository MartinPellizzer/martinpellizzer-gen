It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped flowers that are often brightly colored. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds with a tuft of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are typically alternate, simple, and have a rough texture. Cleistanthus pedicellatus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
