    "intro": "Cynanchum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has slender, branched stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, with a slightly rough texture. Cynanchum pumilum is part of the milkweed family and contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores."
