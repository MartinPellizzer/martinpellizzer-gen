    "intro": "Calystegia dahurica f. pellita, commonly known as the Siberian morning glory, is a herbaceous vine native to the colder regions of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant is characterized by its long, trailing stems and is often found growing along riverbanks or in moist, shaded areas. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. Due to its cold hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in temperate gardens as a seasonal flowering plant."
