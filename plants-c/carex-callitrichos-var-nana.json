    "intro": "Carex callitrichos var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to greenish flowers in the summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded areas. Its compact size makes it a popular choice for ornamental use in water gardens and bog landscapes."
