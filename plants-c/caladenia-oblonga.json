    "intro": "Caladenia oblonga, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spider-orchid, is a striking orchid native to Western Australia. It features a slender, erect stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf and a single, intricately designed flower that is typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as heathlands and woodlands. It blooms during the spring season, producing a distinctive, spider-like appearance that aids in its pollination by specific insect species. Caladenia oblonga is a protected species due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss."
