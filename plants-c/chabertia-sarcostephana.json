    "intro": "Chabertia sarcostephana, commonly known as the rock cress, is a perennial flowering plant native to rocky and arid environments. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, rounded pods. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hair, helping to reduce water loss. Chabertia sarcostephana is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
