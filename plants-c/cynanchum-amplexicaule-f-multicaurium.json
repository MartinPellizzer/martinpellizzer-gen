    "intro": "Cynanchum amplexicaule f. multicaurium, commonly known as the multifurrowed milkvetch, is a variant of the milkvetch genus native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. This plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
