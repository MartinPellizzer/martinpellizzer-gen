    "intro": "Cirsium arvense var. decurrens, commonly known as the creeping thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces purple to pink flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it is considered a problematic weed in many regions."
