    "intro": "Caralluma schweinfurthii, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, ribbed stems that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are reduced to spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration. Caralluma schweinfurthii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
