    "intro": "Cypripedium wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy pink or purple flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a pollination mechanism. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it produces a single, erect flower stem each year. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
