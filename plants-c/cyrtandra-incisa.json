    "intro": "Cyrtandra incisa, commonly known as the Hawaiian bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and streamside areas. Cyrtandra incisa has heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
