    "intro": "Cogswellia macdougalii, commonly known as the Macdougal's cactus, is a rare and unique species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on branched clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
