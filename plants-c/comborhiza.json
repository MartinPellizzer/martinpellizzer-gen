    "intro": "Comborhiza, commonly known as the swamp hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its botanical name reflects its unique genetic relationship with both monocots and dicots. Comborhiza is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
