    "intro": "Camphorosma monspeliense, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are often used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties. Camphorosma monspeliense is well adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can thrive with minimal water."
