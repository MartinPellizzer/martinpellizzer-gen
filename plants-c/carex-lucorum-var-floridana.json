    "intro": "Carex lucorum var. floridana, commonly known as the Florida sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It has narrow, linear leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in a compact rosette. This variety is valued for its ecological role in wetland habitats and its ornamental appeal in aquatic gardens."
