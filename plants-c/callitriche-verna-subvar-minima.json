    "intro": "Callitriche verna subvar. minima, commonly known as the small spring starwort, is a diminutive aquatic or semi-aquatic plant found in shallow freshwater habitats. It typically grows in still or slow-moving waters, such as ponds, ditches, and marshes. The plant features small, star-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, with a delicate, herbaceous appearance. Its flowers are small and white, appearing in clusters, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. This subspecies is characterized by its compact size and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize water edges."
