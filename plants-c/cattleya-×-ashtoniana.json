    "intro": "Cattleya \u00d7 ashtoniana, commonly known as the Ashtoniana orchid, is a hybrid orchid species originating from crosses between Cattleya mossiae and Cattleya bicolor. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink and purple, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. The orchid is prized by horticulturists for its beauty and ease of cultivation."
