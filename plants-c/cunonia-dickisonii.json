It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
