    "intro": "Cuscuta cymosa, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has a tangled, vine-like structure composed of thin, thread-like stems. The plant is native to North America and can be found growing on a variety of host plants, including grasses and forbs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unchecked."
