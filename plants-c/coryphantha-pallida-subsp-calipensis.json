    "intro": "Coryphantha pallida subsp. calipensis, commonly known as the Calipensis ghostflower, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, cactus-like plant with a short, cylindrical stem and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, featuring spiny stems and reduced leaves to minimize water loss. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
