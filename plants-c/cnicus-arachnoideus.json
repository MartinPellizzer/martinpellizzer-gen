It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, yellow flowers with a distinctive, spiky appearance. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas. Cnicus arachnoideus is also known for its ability to spread rapidly through seed dispersal by wind and animals."
