    "intro": "Coelogyne rhombophora, commonly known as the rhombus orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with red markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, warm environments. Its rhombic-shaped pseudobulbs and dense, dark green foliage contribute to its ornamental appeal. Coelogyne rhombophora is valued in horticulture for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
