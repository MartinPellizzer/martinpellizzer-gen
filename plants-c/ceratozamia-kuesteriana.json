    "intro": "Ceratozamia kuesteriana, commonly known as the Kuester's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones for reproduction. Its slow growth rate and limited distribution make it a conservation concern. The botanical features of Ceratozamia kuesteriana reflect its evolutionary history as a gymnosperm, adapted to survive in arid and rocky environments."
