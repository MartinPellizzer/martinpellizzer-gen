Its leaves are finely divided, forming a feathery appearance, while its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
