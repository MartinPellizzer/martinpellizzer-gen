    "intro": "Cornus florida var. xanthocarpa, commonly known as the yellow-flowered dogwood, is a cultivar of the flowering dogwood tree. It is characterized by its showy, yellow bracts that appear in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small white flowers clustered in an umbel, which are surrounded by the vibrant yellow bracts. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. This variety is valued for its striking spring display and its ability to attract pollinators."
