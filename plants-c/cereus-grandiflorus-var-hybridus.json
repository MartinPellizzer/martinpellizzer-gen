    "intro": "Cereus grandiflorus var. hybridus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cactus species native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its striking appearance and unique blooming habit, it is a popular choice for both ornamental and horticultural purposes."
