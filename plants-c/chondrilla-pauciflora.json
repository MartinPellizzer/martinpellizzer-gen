    "intro": "Chondrilla pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered chondrilla, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows as a low-growing perennial herb with gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually yellow or whitish, arranged in a compact cluster at the top of the stem. Chondrilla pauciflora is adapted to survive in harsh environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
