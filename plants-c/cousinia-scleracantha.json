    "intro": "Cousinia scleracantha, commonly known as the hard-stemmed fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant has slender, wiry stems covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, providing additional protection against drought. Cousinia scleracantha produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
