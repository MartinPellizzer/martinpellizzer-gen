    "intro": "Chaptalia callacallensis, commonly known as the Andean chaptalia, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbels, a feature common in the Apiaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
