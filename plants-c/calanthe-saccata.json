    "intro": "Calanthe saccata, commonly known as the sac-like calanthe, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, sac-like pouch at the base of its flowers, which is a unique feature among orchids. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its elegant appearance. Calanthe saccata produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer."
