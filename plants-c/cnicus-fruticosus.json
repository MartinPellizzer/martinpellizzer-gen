    "intro": "Cnicus fruticosus, commonly known as gooseweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing, perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and its leaves are usually hairy and lobed. Gooseweed has a creeping growth habit, with branched stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks."
