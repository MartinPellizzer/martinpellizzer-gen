    "intro": "Cercouratea erythrocalyx, commonly known as the red calyx cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with the female cones being particularly distinctive for their bright red, fleshy outer covering. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
