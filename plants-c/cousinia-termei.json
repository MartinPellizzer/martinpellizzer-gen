    "intro": "Cousinia termei, commonly known as the Tibetan fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh, cold climates. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cousinia termei plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a source of food for grazing animals."
