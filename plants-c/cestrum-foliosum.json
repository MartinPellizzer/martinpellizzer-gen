    "intro": "Cestrum foliosum, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, silver-gray leaves that give it its common name, and it often grows in woodland or shrubland habitats. It produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Cestrum foliosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and nocturnal fragrance."
