    "intro": "Colpodium compressum, commonly known as the narrowleaf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its slender, floating stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often submerged. The plant produces tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient uptake. It is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family, which includes other carnivorous plants. Colpodium compressum typically grows in still or slow-moving waters, where it can thrive in nutrient-poor conditions."
