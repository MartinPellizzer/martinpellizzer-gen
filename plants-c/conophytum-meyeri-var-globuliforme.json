It is characterized by its compact, rounded leaves that form a dense, globular shape, resembling a small, fleshy ball. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
