It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It grows as an herbaceous perennial, often found in moist, shaded forest understories. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal in the natural habitat."
