It is characterized by its striking violet-purple flowers with reflexed petals and a distinctive, fragrant aroma. The plant produces stigmas, which are harvested and dried to make saffron, a highly valued spice and dye. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a cool, dry climate for optimal growth. This variety is particularly noted for its early flowering and robustness in challenging environmental conditions."
