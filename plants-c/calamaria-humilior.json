It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant features slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy foliage. Its flowers are small and usually pale green or white, arranged in clusters along the stems. Calamaria humilior is adapted to arid conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
