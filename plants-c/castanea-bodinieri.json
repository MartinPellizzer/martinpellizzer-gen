    "intro": "Castanea bodinieri, commonly known as the Bodinier chestnut, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves. The plant produces catkin-like male flowers and female flowers that develop into spiny, chestnut-like fruits. The fruits are typically harvested in the fall and contain one or two seeds surrounded by a fibrous, starchy husk. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
