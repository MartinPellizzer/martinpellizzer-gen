    "intro": "Coutarea portlandia, commonly known as the Portland trumpet tree, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a member of the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its distinctive, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are edible but not widely consumed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas along the coast. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with a temperate climate."
