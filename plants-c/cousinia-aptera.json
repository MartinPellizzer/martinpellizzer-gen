    "intro": "Cousinia aptera, commonly known as the leafless globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compact, globular growth habit and lack of leaves, with most of its photosynthetic activity occurring through its stems. The plant produces showy, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures. Cousinia aptera is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
