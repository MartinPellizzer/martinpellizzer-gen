    "intro": "Calamagrostis arenaria var. australis, commonly known as coastal bluegrass, is a variant of the coastal grass species native to southern regions of Australia. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for coastal environments. This plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. Its flowering stems produce panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are often tinged with reddish hues. Calamagrostis arenaria var. australis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
