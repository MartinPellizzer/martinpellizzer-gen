    "intro": "Clerodendrum neriifolium var. macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-fruited flame bush, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by large, fleshy, orange-red berries. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly serrated margin. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
