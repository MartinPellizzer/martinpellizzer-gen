    "intro": "Cardamine hirsuta f. apetala, commonly known as the hairless watercress, is a variant of the common watercress species. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland areas. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery taste similar to its parent species. The f. apetala form is notable for its reduced floral structures, which may be an adaptation to specific environmental conditions."
