    "intro": "Convolvulus procumbens, commonly known as creeping morning glory, is a low-growing annual vine native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, blooming in the morning. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in disturbed soils and sunny environments. It is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
