    "intro": "Cereus phoeniceus, commonly known as the Christ's Thorn or the Crown of Thorns, is a species of cactus native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its spiny, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements. The plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its unique appearance and resilience."
