    "intro": "Caenopteris violascens, commonly known as the violet fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often display a striking violet hue on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Caenopteris violascens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
