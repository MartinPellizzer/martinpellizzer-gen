    "intro": "Crataegus linnaeana, commonly known as the Linnaean hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and dense foliage. The plant produces white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with serrated edges, and turn vibrant red in autumn. Crataegus linnaeana is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and moist soils, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
