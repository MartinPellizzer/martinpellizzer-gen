    "intro": "Cheilanthes micromera, commonly known as the small-leaf rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows on rocky outcrops and in dry, well-drained soils. The plant has compact, leathery fronds with a dense arrangement of small, rounded pinnae. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments due to its ability to retain moisture and tolerate drought. Cheilanthes micromera is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
