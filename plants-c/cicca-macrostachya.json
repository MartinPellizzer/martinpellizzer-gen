    "intro": "Cicca macrostachya, commonly known as the large-stemmed cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces massive, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
