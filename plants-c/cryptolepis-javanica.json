    "intro": "Cryptolepis javanica, commonly known as the Java cryptolepis, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, three-lobed berries. Its roots and leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antimalarial properties. Cryptolepis javanica thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories."
