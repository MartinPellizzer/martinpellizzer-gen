    "intro": "Cheilanthes meyeniana, commonly known as the rock fern or cliff brake, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial plant that thrives in rocky and crevice habitats, often growing on cliffs or in dry, well-drained soils. The plant has a short, upright rhizome with dense, overlapping, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. Its spore-bearing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in two rows. Cheilanthes meyeniana is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy and resilient plant in its native environment."
