    "intro": "Cryptocoryne nevillii, commonly known as the Nevill's cryptocoryne, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, elongated leaves that are often ribbed and can grow up to 30 cm in length. This plant thrives in soft, slightly acidic water and is often found in slow-moving or still freshwater environments.
