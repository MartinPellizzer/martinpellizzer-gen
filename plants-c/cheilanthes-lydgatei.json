    "intro": "Cheilanthes lydgatei, commonly known as the Lydgate's rock fern, is a species of fern native to the arid regions of western North America. It is a small, terrestrial fern that thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often found in desert environments. The plant has a distinctive morphology, featuring a short, creeping rhizome and compact, lanceolate fronds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. Cheilanthes lydgatei is well adapted to drought conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss."
