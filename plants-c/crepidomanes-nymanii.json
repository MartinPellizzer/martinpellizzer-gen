    "intro": "Crepidomanes nymanii, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habit, with specialized structures called bladders that trap tiny aquatic organisms. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on rhizoids for anchorage and nutrient absorption. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its botanical features reflect adaptations to nutrient-poor environments, where it supplements its diet with captured prey."
