    "intro": "Carex neopolycephala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of eastern North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, rushes, and similar plants. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex neopolycephala is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
