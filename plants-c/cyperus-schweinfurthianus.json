    "intro": "Cyperus schweinfurthianus, commonly known as the swamp spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like stems and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shoreline ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an important component of wetland vegetation. Cyperus schweinfurthianus is also valued for its ability to filter water and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
