    "intro": "Couthovia macroloba, commonly known as the giant leaf fern, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its large, broad fronds. Native to the humid rainforests of Southeast Asia, it thrives in high humidity and indirect light conditions. The plant's fronds can grow up to three meters in length, featuring a feathery structure with serrated edges. It produces spores in small, clustered clusters on the underside of its fronds, typical of ferns. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
