    "intro": "Cotyledon occultans, commonly known as the hidden cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant's leaves are typically green with a waxy coating, and they often display striking variegation patterns. Cotyledon occultans produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the growing season. It is a low-maintenance plant that requires minimal water and well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
