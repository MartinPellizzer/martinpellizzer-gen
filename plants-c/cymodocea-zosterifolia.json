It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that resemble ribbons, which help it thrive in shallow coastal waters. This species is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often forming dense underwater meadows. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to stabilize sediments and support marine biodiversity. The plant plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
