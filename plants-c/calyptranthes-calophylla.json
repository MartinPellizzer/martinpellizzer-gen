    "intro": "Calyptranthes calophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf calyptranthes, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its silvery-gray, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. These flowers are followed by small, round fruits that contain several seeds. Calyptranthes calophylla is adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal chaparral habitats."
