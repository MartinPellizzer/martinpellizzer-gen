    "intro": "Conyza pyrrhopappa subsp. oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fleabane, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its slender, oblong leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that appear in clusters. Native to parts of Africa and the Middle East, this species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. It is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in sandy or rocky habitats."
