    "intro": "Chamaecyparis pisifera var. filicoides, commonly known as the Japanese Falsecypress or lacey falsecypress, is a variant of the Japanese cedar. It is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree that exhibits a unique, feathery appearance due to its finely divided, scale-like leaves. The foliage is a soft, silvery-green, which gives the plant a delicate, lace-like texture. It produces small, cone-like structures that are typically borne in clusters at the ends of the branches. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes, particularly in regions with mild, humid climates."
