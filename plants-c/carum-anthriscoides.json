    "intro": "Carum anthriscoides, commonly known as lesser celandine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady areas and has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread rapidly. Its foliage is often mistaken for that of true celandine, but it lacks the orange sap found in the latter. Carum anthriscoides is also known for its medicinal properties, though it can be toxic in large quantities."
