    "intro": "Coelogyne thuniana, commonly known as the Orchid of the Gods, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters of 10 to 20, often in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are strap-shaped and evergreen, contributing to its ornamental value. Coelogyne thuniana is typically epiphytic, growing on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments."
