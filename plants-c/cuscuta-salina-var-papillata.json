    "intro": "Cuscuta salina var. papillata, commonly known as salt dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It is native to coastal areas and thrives in saline environments, often found growing on plants such as saltgrass and other halophytes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a weak, thread-like stem covered in tiny, papillate structures. Its seeds are dispersed by wind and can remain viable in the soil for extended periods. This species plays a role in coastal ecosystems by contributing to the ecological balance of salt-affected habitats."
