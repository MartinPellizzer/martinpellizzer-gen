    "intro": "Carduus \u00d7 orthocephalus nothosubsp. orthocephalus, commonly known as the orthocephalus thistle, is a hybrid plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and composite flower heads that typically range from yellow to purple. The plant is native to regions of Europe and the Middle East, where it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its spread. Due to its robust growth and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
