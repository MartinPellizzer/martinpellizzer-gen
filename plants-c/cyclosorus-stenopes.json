    "intro": "Cyclosorus stenopes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water clover, is a species of aquatic fern found in freshwater environments. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are divided into small, lance-shaped segments, giving it a clover-like appearance. Cyclosorus stenopes plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering nutrients and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
