    "intro": "Calophyllum paniculatum, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a tropical tree native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in brackish or saline environments, often forming dense thickets in mangrove ecosystems. The tree plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
