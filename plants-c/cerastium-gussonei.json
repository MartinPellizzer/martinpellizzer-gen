    "intro": "Cerastium gussonei, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cooler climates."
