    "intro": "Cupressus coerulea var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf blue atlas cedar, is a compact, low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features dense, scale-like foliage that is a striking deep blue-gray, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, round cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, adding visual interest in the winter months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a decorative hedge. Due to its slow growth rate and compact form, it is ideal for small spaces and requires minimal maintenance."
