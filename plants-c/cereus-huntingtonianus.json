    "intro": "Cereus huntingtonianus, commonly known as Huntington's cactus, is a flowering cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem with a ribbed structure and spines that are often reddish in color. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
