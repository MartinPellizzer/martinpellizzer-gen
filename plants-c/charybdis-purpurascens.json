    "intro": "Charybdis purpurascens, commonly known as the purple jellyfish, is a species of jellyfish belonging to the family Rhizostomidae. It is characterized by its translucent, bell-shaped body with a distinctive purple hue, which gives it its common name. The oral arms are short and used for capturing prey, primarily small planktonic organisms. It thrives in warm, shallow coastal waters and is often found in the Mediterranean Sea and the eastern Atlantic. Due to its bioluminescent properties, it is sometimes referred to as the \"sea's flame.\""
