    "intro": "Convallaria punctata, commonly known as the spotted lily, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive purple or red spot at the base. The plant produces showy, clustered blooms in early spring, typically on stems that rise above the foliage. Its leaves are lance-shaped and form a dense, grass-like rosette at the base. Convallaria punctata is often found in moist, woodland environments and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance."
