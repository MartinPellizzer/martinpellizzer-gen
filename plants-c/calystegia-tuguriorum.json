It is characterized by its trailing or climbing habit, with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in summer. Native to Central Asia, it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its rapid growth and ornamental flowers make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in certain regions."
