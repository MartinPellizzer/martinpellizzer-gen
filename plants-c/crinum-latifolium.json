    "intro": "Crinum latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf crinum, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. The plant features broad, strap-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help the plant survive adverse conditions. Crinum latifolium is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
