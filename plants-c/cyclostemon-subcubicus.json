    "intro": "Cyclostemon subcubicus, commonly known as the Cuban cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It is native to Cuba and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
