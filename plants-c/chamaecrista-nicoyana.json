    "intro": "Chamaecrista nicoyana, commonly known as the Nicoyan Crownflower, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with numerous small leaflets arranged along the stem. Chamaecrista nicoyana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
