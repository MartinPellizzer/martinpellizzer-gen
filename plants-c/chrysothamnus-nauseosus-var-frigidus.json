    "intro": "Chrysothamnus nauseosus var. frigidus, commonly known as the alpine goldenbush, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine tundra and rocky slopes. Its small, glandular leaves are adapted to reduce water loss in cold, arid conditions. This variety is distinguished from the typical form by its more compact growth habit and smaller stature."
