    "intro": "Cymopterus corrugatus var. scopulicola, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is part of the evening primrose family and is adapted to thrive in harsh, well-drained conditions."
