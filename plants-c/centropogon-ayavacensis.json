    "intro": "Centropogon ayavacensis, commonly known as the Ayavac\u00e9n orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are usually pale green to white in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
