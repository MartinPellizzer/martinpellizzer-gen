    "intro": "Clavija ernstii, commonly known as the Ernst's clavija, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences composed of small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine regions where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapted to minimize water loss in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Clavija ernstii is considered a species of conservation concern."
