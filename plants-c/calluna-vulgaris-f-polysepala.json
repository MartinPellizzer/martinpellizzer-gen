    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris f. polysepala, commonly known as the purple heather with multiple sepals, is a botanical variant of the common heather. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, featuring multiple sepals that give it a more complex appearance compared to the typical form. This form is often found in acidic, well-drained soils in temperate regions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in open, sunny habitats and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
