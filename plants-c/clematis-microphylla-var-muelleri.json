    "intro": "Clematis microphylla var. muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's small-leaved clematis, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, glossy, ovate leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers with five petals, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for garden cultivation in temperate climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
