    "intro": "Cinnagrostis curta, commonly known as the dwarf goldenweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern United States and Canada. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish-orange flowers in the summer. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. Cinnagrostis curta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
