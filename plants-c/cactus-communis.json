    "intro": "Cactus communis, commonly known as the common cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant typically has spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its flowers, often bright and showy, appear during the warmer months. Cactus communis plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing shelter and food for various desert animals."
