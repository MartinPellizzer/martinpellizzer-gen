    "intro": "Cypella boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian cypella, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Bolivia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and has a compact, herbaceous structure. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a disk-like pattern, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes. Cypella boliviana is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments."
