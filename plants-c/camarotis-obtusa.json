It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams. The plant features slender, triangular stems and broad, flat leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets and are pollinated by wind. Camarotis obtusa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
