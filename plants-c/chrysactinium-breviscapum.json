    "intro": "Chrysactinium breviscapum, commonly known as the narrow-cup fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered spores on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
