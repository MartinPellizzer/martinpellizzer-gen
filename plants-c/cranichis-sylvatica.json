    "intro": "Cranichis sylvatica, commonly known as the wood orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the temperate regions of Europe. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, upright stem and a single, showy flower that typically blooms in late spring. The plant has a short root system and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common feature among orchids. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flower is usually pink or purple with a distinctive lip. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
