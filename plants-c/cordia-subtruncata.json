    "intro": "Cordia subtruncata, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually glossy green. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, red berries that are an important food source for birds and mammals. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
