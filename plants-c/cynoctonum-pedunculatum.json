    "intro": "Cynoctonum pedunculatum, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Andes, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its striking white or pink flowers bloom above the water. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in lakes and wetlands. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the surrounding sediment. Cynoctonum pedunculatum is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its cultural and medicinal significance in indigenous communities."
