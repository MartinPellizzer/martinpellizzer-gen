    "intro": "Calonemorchis brownii, commonly known as the Brown's calonemorchis, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, elongated leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
