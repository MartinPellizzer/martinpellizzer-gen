    "intro": "Chrysastrum, commonly known as golden groundsel, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its showy yellow flowers and succulent, often hairy leaves. These plants are native to the Americas and are often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Chrysastrum species typically grow as herbaceous perennials or annuals, and they are adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. The flowers are usually arranged in a composite head, with both ray and disk florets, contributing to their ornamental value."
