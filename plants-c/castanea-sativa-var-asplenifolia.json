    "intro": "Castanea sativa var. asplenifolia, commonly known as the asplenifoliated sweet chestnut, is a variant of the sweet chestnut tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its finely lobed, asplenifoliate leaves that resemble those of the fern genus Asplenium. The plant produces edible nuts enclosed in spiny husks, similar to other chestnut species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and forest edges. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique foliage, making it a sought-after specimen in horticulture."
