    "intro": "Corydalis, commonly known as the \"Fritillary\" or \"Coralroot,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fumariaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, often spurred flowers that come in a variety of colors, including pink, red, and yellow. Corydalis species are typically herbaceous perennials, with slender stems and lance-shaped leaves. They are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in Asia, Europe, and North America. Many species are cultivated for their ornamental value and are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
