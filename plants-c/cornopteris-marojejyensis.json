    "intro": "Cornopteris marojejyensis, commonly known as the Marojejy water fern, is a rare and endemic species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds with a distinctive morphology. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in montane rainforests. Its unique genetic makeup and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanical research. Conservation efforts are crucial due to its vulnerability to habitat loss and climate change."
