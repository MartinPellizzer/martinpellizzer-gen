    "intro": "Chiliotrichiopsis, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, bladder-like structures used for trapping aquatic invertebrates. They typically grow in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Chiliotrichiopsis species are known for their delicate, hair-like roots and their ability to float or anchor themselves in water. Their unique morphology and carnivorous adaptations make them an interesting subject in the study of aquatic botany."
