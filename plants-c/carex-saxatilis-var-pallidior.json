    "intro": "Carex saxatilis var. pallidior, commonly known as the pale sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and gravelly habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. The plant produces cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, greenish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. This variety is valued in gardens for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
