    "intro": "Chrysanthemum montanum, commonly known as the mountain chrysanthemum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30 to 100 centimeters and features upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces daisy-like flowers in a range of colors, including white, yellow, and orange, during the late summer and autumn months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Chrysanthemum montanum is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and high altitudes."
