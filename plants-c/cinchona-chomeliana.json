    "intro": "Cinchona chomeliana, commonly known as the Chomel's quinine tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces dark red berries that contain elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by birds. It is valued for its historical use in the production of quinine, a compound used in the treatment of malaria. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
