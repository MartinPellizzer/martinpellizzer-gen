    "intro": "Castilleja pallida subsp. caudata, commonly known as the pale castilleja with a tail, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reduced, often leafless stems and showy, bright yellow to orange-red flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed sites. It forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi to obtain some of its nutrients. Its subspecific name, *caudata*, refers to the elongated, tail-like appearance of its stems."
