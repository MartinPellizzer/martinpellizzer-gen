    "intro": "Cynoglossum furcatum var. tenerum, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of thick, woolly, and often blue or purple-hued leaves. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
