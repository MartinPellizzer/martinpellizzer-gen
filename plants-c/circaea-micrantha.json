It is characterized by its small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils in woodlands and along stream banks. Circaea micrantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
