    "intro": "Cypripedium reginae f. album, commonly known as the white lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the northern regions of North America. This variant of the showy lady's slipper is distinguished by its pale white petals and sepals, which give it a more subdued appearance compared to the typical pink or yellow varieties. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and wetlands, where it forms a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip that resembles a slipper, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in many areas."
