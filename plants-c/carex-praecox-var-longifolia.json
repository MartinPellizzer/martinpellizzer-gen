    "intro": "Carex praecox var. longifolia, commonly known as the early sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and three-ranked leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, inconspicuous flowers, which are wind-pollinated. The leaves are usually long and narrow, with a bluish-green color, and the plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wildlife."
