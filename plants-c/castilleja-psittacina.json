    "intro": "Castilleja psittacina, commonly known as the hummingbird milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red to orange flowers that attract pollinators like hummingbirds. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It forms symbiotic relationships with neighboring plants by attaching to their roots and drawing nutrients from them. Castilleja psittacina is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
