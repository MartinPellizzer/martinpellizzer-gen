    "intro": "Carex concolor var. minuscula, commonly known as the dwarf blue sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This variety is distinguished by its smaller size compared to the typical Carex concolor, with shorter leaves and a more compact growth habit. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer."
