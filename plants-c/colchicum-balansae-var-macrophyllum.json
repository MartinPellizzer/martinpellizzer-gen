It is characterized by its large, showy purple to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features broad, strap-like leaves that are often mistaken for those of a lily. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
