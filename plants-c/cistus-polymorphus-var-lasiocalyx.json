    "intro": "Cistus polymorphus var. lasiocalyx, commonly known as the woolly rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, gray-green foliage covered in soft, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in xeriscaping."
