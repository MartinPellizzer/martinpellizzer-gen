    "intro": "Cerasus juliana var. flore-pleno, commonly known as the double-flowered Japanese cherry, is a cultivar of the Prunus species. It is characterized by its dense, double blossoms that give it a more ornamental appearance compared to single-flowered varieties. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its flowers, which appear in early spring, are pink to white and emit a sweet fragrance. This variety is prized for its aesthetic value in gardens and parks, particularly in regions with temperate climates."
