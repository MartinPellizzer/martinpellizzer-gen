It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and panicles of small, spike-like flowers. This subspecies typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal."
