    "intro": "Cyathea hystricosa, commonly known as the spiny tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive spiny appearance on its trunk, which is a unique adaptation for protection against herbivores. Cyathea hystricosa thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in lowland rainforests. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it an important component of tropical forest ecosystems."
