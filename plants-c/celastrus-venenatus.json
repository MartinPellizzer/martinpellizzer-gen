    "intro": "Celastrus venenatus, commonly known as the poison vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Celastraceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright orange berries. These berries contain toxic seeds, making the plant potentially harmful if ingested. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a common weed in disturbed habitats."
