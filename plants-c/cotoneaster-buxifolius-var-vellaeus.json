    "intro": "Cotoneaster buxifolius var. vellaeus, commonly known as the velvetleaf cotoneaster, is a shrub native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that persist into winter. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
