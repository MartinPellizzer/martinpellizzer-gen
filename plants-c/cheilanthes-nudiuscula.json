    "intro": "Cheilanthes nudiuscula, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in rocky habitats, often growing on limestone or sandstone, and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. Cheilanthes nudiuscula is a hardy, low-maintenance plant that is often used in xeriscaping due to its ability to survive with minimal water."
