    "intro": "Claytonia sarmentosa var. tenella, commonly known as the dwarf white shamrock, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white, star-shaped flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded landscapes."
