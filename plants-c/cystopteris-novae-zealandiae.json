    "intro": "Cystopteris novae-zealandiae, commonly known as the New Zealand water fern, is a member of the family Blechnaceae. It is a small, aquatic fern that typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant has fronds that are finely divided and often floating on the water surface. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, which are covered with a layer of fine, hair-like structures. This species is native to New Zealand and is adapted to the region's temperate climate and water conditions."
