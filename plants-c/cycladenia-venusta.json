    "intro": "Cycladenia venusta, commonly known as the showy cyclamen, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features fleshy, tuberous roots that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry periods. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture, adding to its ornamental appeal. Cycladenia venusta thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
