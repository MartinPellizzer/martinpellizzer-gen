    "intro": "Cerastium manticum subsp. erectum, commonly known as the upright mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features small, pale green leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces tiny white or pinkish flowers in the spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its flowering stems are usually erect, hence the subspecies name \"erectum.\" It is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, which can help prevent soil erosion."
