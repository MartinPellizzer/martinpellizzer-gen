    "intro": "Cardamine griffithii var. pentaloba, commonly known as the five-lobed watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately compound leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its leaves are finely divided and often have a peppery taste, similar to other members of the watercress genus. This variety is distinguished by its five-lobed leaflets, which set it apart from other Cardamine species."
