It belongs to the Elaeocarpaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The tree produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by small, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. Celtis tala typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. It is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
