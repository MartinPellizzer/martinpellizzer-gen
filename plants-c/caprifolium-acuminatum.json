    "intro": "Caprifolium acuminatum, commonly known as the sharp-leaved honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically pointed at the tips. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its berries, which are usually red or black, are edible and contain seeds. Caprifolium acuminatum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth."
