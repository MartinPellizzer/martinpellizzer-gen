    "intro": "Cynoglossum glochidiatum var. alpinum, commonly known as alpine forget-me-not, is a flowering plant belonging to the Boraginaceae family. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. This plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often found in mountainous regions of Europe. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
