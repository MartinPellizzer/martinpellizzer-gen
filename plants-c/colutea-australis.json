    "intro": "Colutea australis, commonly known as the Australian burr pea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 1 meter in height, featuring compound leaves with oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
