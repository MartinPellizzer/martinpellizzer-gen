    "intro": "Cucumis kirkbrideana, commonly known as the Kirkbride cucumber, is a rare and little-studied species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, characterized by its vine-like growth habit and distinctive, often ribbed leaves. The plant produces small, pale green fruits that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female blooms, a common trait in many cucurbits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
