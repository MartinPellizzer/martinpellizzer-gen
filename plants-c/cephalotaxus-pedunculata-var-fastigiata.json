    "intro": "Cephalotaxus pedunculata var. fastigiata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to the Himalayas. It features a columnar growth habit with dense, scale-like leaves that are dark green and closely packed. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in shaded environments. Due to its slow growth and unique form, it is often used as a specimen plant in gardens and landscapes."
