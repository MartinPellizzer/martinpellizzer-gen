    "intro": "Cotylolabium lutzii, commonly known as the Lutz's slipper orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped labellum, which is a defining feature of the Orchidaceae family. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small and pale green or yellow, with a complex structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Cotylolabium lutzii is a rare and specialized orchid, reflecting the intricate ecological relationships within its native habitat."
