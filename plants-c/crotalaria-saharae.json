    "intro": "Crotalaria saharae, commonly known as the Saharan crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it access water from underground sources. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to thrive in sandy soils. Crotalaria saharae plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility in its native habitat."
