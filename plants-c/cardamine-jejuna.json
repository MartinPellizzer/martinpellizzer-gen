    "intro": "Cardamine jejuna, commonly known as the narrowleaf water crowfoot, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wetlands, stream margins, and other moist habitats, often forming dense clusters near the water\u2019s edge. The plant has delicate, fern-like leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with small white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas within its preferred environment. Cardamine jejuna plays a role in supporting aquatic insect populations and serves as an indicator species for water quality."
