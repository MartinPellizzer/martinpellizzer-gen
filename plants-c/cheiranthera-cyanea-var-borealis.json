It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vivid blue petals and intricate floral structure. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments, often in cloud forests or alpine meadows. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a delicate, fragrant scent that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
