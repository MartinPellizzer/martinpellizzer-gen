    "intro": "Crocus salurdagensis, commonly known as the Salurda crocus, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring, typically between February and April. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, cup-shaped flowers that are often adorned with a yellow or orange center. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded locations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
