    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe choerorhyncha, commonly known as the dragon tree orchid, is a unique epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear bright yellow flowers with a distinctive, elongated shape. The plant has thick, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water, allowing it to survive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Crocodeilanthe choerorhyncha is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and rarity in cultivation."
