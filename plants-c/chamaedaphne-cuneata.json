    "intro": "Chamaedaphne cuneata, commonly known as black spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to North America. It is characterized by its dark, peeling bark and its small, cone-like fruits that contain seeds. The plant thrives in acidic, wet soils and is often found in boggy or swampy areas. Its leaves are needle-like, typically arranged in bundles of five, and they remain green throughout the year. Chamaedaphne cuneata plays an important ecological role in boreal and temperate forest ecosystems."
