    "intro": "Cyathea media, commonly known as the medium tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant has a rhizome that produces both roots and shoots, allowing it to grow in a variety of moist, shaded environments. Its fronds can reach lengths of up to 3 meters, and the plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Cyathea media plays an important role in tropical ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
