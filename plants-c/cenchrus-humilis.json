    "intro": "Cenchrus humilis, commonly known as the dwarf sandgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a low-growing, perennial grass that forms dense mats, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Cenchrus humilis plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats."
