    "intro": "Calathea bella, commonly known as the velvet leaf calathea, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, intricate leaf patterns that change color in response to light and temperature, a phenomenon known as nyctinasty. The leaves are typically broad and oval, with a velvety texture and a variety of shades ranging from deep green to reddish-brown. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Calathea bella is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
