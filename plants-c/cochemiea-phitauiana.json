    "intro": "Cochemiea phitauiana, commonly known as the Desert Sun Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are typically clustered at the top of the stem. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from the soil after rare rainfalls. Cochemiea phitauiana is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
