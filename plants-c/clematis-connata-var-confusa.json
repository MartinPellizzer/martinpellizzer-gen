    "intro": "Clematis connata var. confusa, commonly known as the Florida clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, twining stems that can grow up to 15 feet in length, supported by small, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer. Its botanical characteristics include a fibrous root system and a climbing habit, making it well-suited for trellises or arbors. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
