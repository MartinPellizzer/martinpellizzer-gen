    "intro": "Cyclostemon globosus, commonly known as the globe cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a dense crown of feathery, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces large, spherical cones that are typically male and female, with the female cones being more prominent. It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its slow growth and specific care requirements, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
