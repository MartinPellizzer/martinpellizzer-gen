    "intro": "Cucumis sativus var. iranoturanicus, commonly known as the Iranian-Turanian cucumber, is a botanical variant native to Central Asia and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its elongated, slender fruits with a smooth, pale green skin. The plant typically grows as an annual vine, producing small, yellow flowers and bearing cucumbers that are often used in local cuisines. Its genetic makeup reflects adaptations to arid and semi-arid climates, making it resilient to drought conditions. This variety is valued for its crisp texture and mild flavor, suitable for both fresh consumption and preservation."
