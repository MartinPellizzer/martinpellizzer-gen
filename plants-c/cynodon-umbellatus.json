    "intro": "Cynodon umbellatus, commonly known as the umbrella grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive, umbrella-like inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and along riverbanks, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, often with a bluish-gray hue, and it produces small, white to pinkish flowers in summer. Cynodon umbellatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature."
