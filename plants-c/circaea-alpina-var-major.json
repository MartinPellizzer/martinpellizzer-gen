    "intro": "Circaea alpina var. major, commonly known as the alpine cranberry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers with four petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains several seeds, adapted for dispersal by wind or animals."
