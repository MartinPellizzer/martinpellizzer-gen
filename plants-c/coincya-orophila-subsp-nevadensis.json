    "intro": "Coincya orophila subsp. nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada marshwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of lakes and streams. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is adapted to moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in high-elevation environments."
