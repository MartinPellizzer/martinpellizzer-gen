It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are usually basal and have a distinctive reddish-brown coloration, which gives the plant its common name. Cuellaria ferruginea is often used in traditional medicine and is also a subject of ecological studies due to its adaptability to harsh environments."
