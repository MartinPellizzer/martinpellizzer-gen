    "intro": "Carex glauca var. leiocarpa, commonly known as blue-green sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its dense growth habit makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and habitat creation in wetland ecosystems."
