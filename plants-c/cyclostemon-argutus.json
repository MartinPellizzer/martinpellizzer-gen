    "intro": "Cyclostemon argutus, commonly known as the woolly cycad, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fibrous trunk and large, compound leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically hidden within the leaf axils. Cyclostemon argutus is a slow-growing, long-lived species that thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its striking appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
