It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and showy, white flowers. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
