    "intro": "Cyclosorus micans, commonly known as the creeping liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or decaying wood. The plant has a distinctive structure with a prostrate stem that produces leaf-like structures called phyllodes. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, develop on the upper surface of the leaves. Cyclosorus micans plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
