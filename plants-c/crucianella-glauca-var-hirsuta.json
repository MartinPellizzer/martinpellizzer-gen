    "intro": "Crucianella glauca var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called vesicles, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, often in muddy or sandy substrates. Its leaves are usually short and fleshy, and the plant lacks true roots, relying instead on rhizoids for anchorage. The hairy appearance of the stems and leaves, from which the variety name derives, helps in distinguishing it from other similar species."
