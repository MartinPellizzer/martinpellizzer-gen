    "intro": "Cnidoscolus rupestris, commonly known as the rock hibiscus, is a perennial shrub native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in the spring and summer. Its fruit is a spiny capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its propagation. Cnidoscolus rupestris is adapted to arid environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in dry forests."
