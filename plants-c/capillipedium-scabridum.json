    "intro": "Capillipedium scabridum, commonly known as the roughleaf capillipedium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a rough, textured surface, which gives it its common name. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale green, and they bloom in the spring. Capillipedium scabridum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local insect populations."
