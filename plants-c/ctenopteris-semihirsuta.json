    "intro": "Ctenopteris semihirsuta, commonly known as the Hairy Ctenopteris, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady gardens."
