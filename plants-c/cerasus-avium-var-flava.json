    "intro": "Cerasus avium var. flava, commonly known as the yellow cherry, is a variant of the sweet cherry species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its yellow fruit, which ripens in late summer and is often used in culinary applications. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are ovate with a serrated edge, and it produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring. The botanical features of this variety make it distinct from the more common red or black cherries, particularly in its fruit color and seasonal bloom patterns."
