    "intro": "Clematis alpina var. repens, commonly known as the alpine clematis, is a perennial vine native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves with serrated edges, and it produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that disperse its seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging, high-altitude conditions."
