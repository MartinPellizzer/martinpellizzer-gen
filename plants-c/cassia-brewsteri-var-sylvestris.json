    "intro": "Cassia brewsteri var. sylvestris, commonly known as the desert cassia, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow, fluffy flower clusters that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its seed pods are elongated and contain numerous small, flat seeds that are dispersed by wind. Cassia brewsteri var. sylvestris is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
