    "intro": "Cistus serratus, commonly known as the serrated rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has leathery, gray-green leaves with serrated edges, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Cistus serratus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in perfumery."
