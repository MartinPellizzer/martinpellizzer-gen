    "intro": "Cenchrus tristachyus, commonly known as the desert grass or goat grass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soils. Cenchrus tristachyus is often used for forage by livestock and has some traditional medicinal uses in certain regions."
