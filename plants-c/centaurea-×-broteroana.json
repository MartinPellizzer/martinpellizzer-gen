    "intro": "Centaurea \u00d7 broteroana, commonly known as the hybrid blueweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Centaurea cyanus (garden bachelor's button) and Centaurea stoebe (knout). The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features blue to violet flowers with prominent central disk flowers. It is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its hybrid nature, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes but is sometimes seen in naturalized settings."
