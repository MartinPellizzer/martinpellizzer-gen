    "intro": "Colea nitida, commonly known as the silverleaf daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its silvery, fuzzy leaves and small white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and prefers full sun. It is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its compact growth habit and attractive foliage. Colea nitida is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid climates."
