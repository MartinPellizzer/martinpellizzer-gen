    "intro": "Cystopteris stipellata, commonly known as the slender maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Onocleaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Cystopteris stipellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
