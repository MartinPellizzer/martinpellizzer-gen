    "intro": "Coelogyne marthae, commonly known as the Marthae's orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant blossoms that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant features a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a compact rosette, while the inflorescence can produce multiple flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow. Coelogyne marthae is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
