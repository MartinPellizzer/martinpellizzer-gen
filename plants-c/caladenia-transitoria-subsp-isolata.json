    "intro": "Caladenia transitoria subsp. isolata, commonly known as the isolated spider-orchid, is a striking orchid species native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, showy flower that typically displays a deep purple or violet hue. The plant produces a single, narrow leaf and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids. It blooms during the cooler months, usually between June and August, and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
