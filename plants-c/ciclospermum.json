    "intro": "Ciclospermum, commonly known as the spiral spore plant, is a genus of aquatic ferns belonging to the family Marsileaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique, floating leaves that resemble a four-leaf clover, with a spiral arrangement of the leaflets. They produce small, floating spores that are dispersed by water currents, aiding in their propagation. Ciclospermum species are typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Their botanical structure includes rhizomes that anchor the plant and support the growth of the floating leaves."
