    "intro": "Chamaesyce hyssopifolia, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for arid or semi-arid landscapes. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
