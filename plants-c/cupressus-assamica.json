    "intro": "Cupressus assamica, commonly known as the Assam cedar, is a coniferous tree native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its narrow, pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain winged seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in temperate forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is also cultivated in botanical gardens and landscapes."
