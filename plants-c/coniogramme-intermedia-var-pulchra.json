    "intro": "Coniogramme intermedia var. pulchra, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a striking evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright yellow to golden in color, with a distinctive star-like appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, making it suitable for woodland gardens or as a container plant. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to add a tropical feel to shaded landscapes."
