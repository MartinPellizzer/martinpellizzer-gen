    "intro": "[WRONG START] Calanthe h Hancockii, commonly known as the Hancock's calanthe, is a rare and elegant orchid native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rhizome and striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of showy, fragrant flowers in late spring, with petals that range from white to pale pink, often marked with intricate purple or brown patterns. It thrives in cool, humid environments with partial shade, making it a prized species among orchid enthusiasts. Due to its limited natural habitat and threats from habitat loss, Calanthe hancockii is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
