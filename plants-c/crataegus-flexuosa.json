    "intro": "Crataegus flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces white to pink flowers in the spring, followed by red berries in the fall. Its leaves are usually alternate, with a serrated margin, and the bark is smooth when young but becomes fissured with age. Crataegus flexuosa is often found in moist woodlands and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
