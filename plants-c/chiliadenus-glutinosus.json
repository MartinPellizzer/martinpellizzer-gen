    "intro": "Chiliadenus glutinosus, commonly known as the sticky chiliadenus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that give its stems and leaves a sticky texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are typically elliptical with a leathery texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
