It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and serrated leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces catkins in early spring, with male and female flowers on separate plants. Its edible nuts are enclosed in a spiny husk and are often used in cooking or baking. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting wildlife."
