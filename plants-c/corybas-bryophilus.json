    "intro": "Corybas bryophilus, commonly known as the moss-loving helmet orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, helmet-shaped flower that is typically dark red or purple in color. This species is endemic to New Zealand, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant's morphology is adapted to its specific habitat, with small, leathery leaves and a specialized root system that helps it anchor in nutrient-poor soils. Its pollination is facilitated by specific insect species, making it an important part of the local ecological network."
