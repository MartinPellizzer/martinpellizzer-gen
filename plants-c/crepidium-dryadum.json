    "intro": "Crepidium dryadum, commonly known as the dryad's orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features a slender, erect stem with a single, showy flower that is typically pale green or yellowish in color. The plant has a basal rosette of linear leaves and produces a distinctive, spurred lip that aids in pollination. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
