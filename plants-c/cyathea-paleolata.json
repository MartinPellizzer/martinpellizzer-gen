    "intro": "Cyathea paleolata, commonly known as the ancient tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for many decades, making it a long-lived species. Its rhizome system supports the growth of new shoots, contributing to its ability to form dense stands. Cyathea paleolata plays an important ecological role in tropical rainforests, providing habitat and shelter for various organisms."
