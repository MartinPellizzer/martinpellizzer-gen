    "intro": "Cuscuta krishnae, commonly known as Krishna's dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is characterized by its yellow-orange, thread-like stems that wrap around and attach to the stems of its host, typically other flowering plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers and relies on wind for pollination. It is native to parts of South and Southeast Asia, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants."
