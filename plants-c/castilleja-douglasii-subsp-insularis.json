    "intro": "Castilleja douglasii subsp. insularis, commonly known as the San Clemente Island castilleja, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the Channel Islands of California. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reddish-orange to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a slender, branched stem and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi and relies on host plants for some of its nutrients. This subspecies is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its rocky, coastal habitat."
