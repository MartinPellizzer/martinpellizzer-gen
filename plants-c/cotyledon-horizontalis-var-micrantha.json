    "intro": "Cotyledon horizontalis var. micrantha, commonly known as the \"Hairy Cotyledon,\" is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a fuzzy texture, often covered in fine white hairs. The leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, and the plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and requiring minimal water once established. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements in gardens."
