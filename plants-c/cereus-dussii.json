    "intro": "Cereus dussii, commonly known as the Dussius candle, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, nocturnal flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. These flowers bloom only once a year, usually during the warmer months. Cereus dussii is well adapted to desert environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water and reduce transpiration."
