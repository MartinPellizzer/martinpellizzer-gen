    "intro": "Calamagrostis aurea, commonly known as golden reed, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and its striking golden-yellow plumes that appear in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Calamagrostis aurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
