    "intro": "Calophyllum rigidulum, commonly known as the rigid candlewood, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, often reddish-brown bark. The plant produces fragrant yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture with a glossy surface. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds."
