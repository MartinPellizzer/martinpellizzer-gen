    "intro": "Cardaminopsis arenosa var. dependens, commonly known as the sand saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, clustered leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations to harsh environments."
