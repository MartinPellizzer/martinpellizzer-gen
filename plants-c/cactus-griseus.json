    "intro": "Cactus griseus, commonly known as the silver barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical shape and dense covering of white, woolly hairs that reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its gray-green appearance. Its stems are succulent, allowing it to store water efficiently in its native desert environment. Cactus griseus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
