    "intro": "Cymbidiella humblotii, commonly known as the Humblot's orchid, is a rare and exquisite member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Brazil and Peru. This epiphytic plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of rainforests. Its flowers are small and delicate, typically ranging in color from white to pale yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cymbidiella humblotii is considered a species of conservation concern."
