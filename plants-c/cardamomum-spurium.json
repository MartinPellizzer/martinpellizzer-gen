    "intro": "Cardamomum spurium, commonly known as the wild cardamom or Indian cardamom, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which also includes ginger and turmeric, and is characterized by its aromatic, finger-like rhizomes. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and have a strong, spicy aroma, which is similar to its more commercially cultivated relatives. Cardamomum spurium is primarily valued for its rhizomes, which are used in traditional medicine and as a spice in various cuisines."
