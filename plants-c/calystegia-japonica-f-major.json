    "intro": "Calystegia japonica f. major, commonly known as the giant Japanese morning glory, is a variant of the morning glory family (Convolvulaceae). It is a vigorous climbing vine characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range from white to pink in color. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves and has a rapid growth rate, making it suitable for covering trellises or fences. Botanically, it is distinguished by its thick, fleshy stems and the presence of tendrils that aid in its climbing habit. This form is notable for its larger floral display compared to the typical species."
