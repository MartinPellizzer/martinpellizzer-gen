    "intro": "Ctenitis lasiernos, commonly known as the rough-leaf h\u517b\u6210, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed fronds that are often covered in a layer of fine, hairy scales. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the substrate, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Ctenitis lasiernos is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
