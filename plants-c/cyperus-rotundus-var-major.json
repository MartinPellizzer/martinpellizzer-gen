    "intro": "Cyperus rotundus var. major, commonly known as nutgrass, is a perennial grassy plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread aggressively and form dense mats. The plant produces small, three-lobed, yellowish flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Nutgrass is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its persistent and invasive nature."
