    "intro": "Calamagrostis nipponica, commonly known as Japanese feather reed, is a perennial grass native to East Asia. It features slender, arching stems that bear narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces feathery, panicle-shaped inflorescences that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
