It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with two opposite leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Cranichis similis is often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi, which play a crucial role in its nutrient uptake."
