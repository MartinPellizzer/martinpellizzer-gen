    "intro": "Cranichis elliptica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, pale green to yellowish flowers with a distinct lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
