    "intro": "Cuscuta callinema, commonly known as the red-stemd dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle involving seed germination, attachment to a host, and subsequent growth. The plant's stems are often reddish in color, and it can infest a variety of agricultural and wild plants. It is native to regions in the Americas and is considered a weed in some areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
