    "intro": "Cordyline racemosa, commonly known as the red torch ginger, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of vibrant red bracts that resemble torches, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in dense inflorescences, often surrounded by the showy red bracts. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Cordyline racemosa is often cultivated in warm climates for its visual impact and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in shaded environments."
