    "intro": "Cardamine flexuosoides, commonly known as the flexible water crowfoot, is a delicate aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often near streams and ponds. The plant features small, floating or submerged leaves that are lance-shaped and arranged in a whorled pattern. Its flowers are white or pale yellow, with four petals and numerous stamens, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and serving as a food source for herbivorous fish."
