    "intro": "Chamelaucium floriferum, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to sandy, saline soils and can tolerate high levels of salt spray. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for coastal landscaping. Chamelaucium floriferum is also valued for its fragrant oils, which are used in aromatherapy and traditional medicine."
