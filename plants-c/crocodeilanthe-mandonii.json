    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe mandonii, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. The plant has a compact growth habit with fleshy, dark green leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection."
