    "intro": "Cymbidium verecundum, commonly known as the noble orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high altitudes of China, particularly in Yunnan Province. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, bearing several large, showy flowers. The petals and sepals are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive golden lip that adds to its ornamental appeal. This plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts for its elegance and relatively easy care requirements."
