    "intro": "Ctenopteris alboglandulosa, commonly known as the white-glandular sea palm, is a species of fern belonging to the family Ctenopteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like fronds that are often covered in white, glandular dots, which are a key identifying feature. The plant thrives in marine environments, typically found in intertidal zones where it attaches to rocky substrates. Its fronds are usually narrow and linear, with a leathery texture that helps it withstand harsh coastal conditions. The reproductive structures, such as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat."
