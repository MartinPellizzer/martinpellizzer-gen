    "intro": "Castanopsis oleifera, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, chestnut-like nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other regions for forestry and ornamental purposes. However, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native flora."
