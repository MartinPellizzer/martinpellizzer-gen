    "intro": "Crocus niveus, commonly known as the snow crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It produces showy, early spring flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with three petals and three sepals. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette of bulbs. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. The snow crocus is often among the first flowering plants to appear in early spring, signaling the arrival of warmer weather."
