    "intro": "Cordia rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf cordia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are round or oval in shape, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellowish flowers that are often clustered in terminal panicles, followed by fleshy, red berries that contain several seeds. It is often found in dry forests and scrublands, where it plays a role in local ecosystems. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine."
