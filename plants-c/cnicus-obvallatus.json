    "intro": "Cnicus obvallatus, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are lobed and often covered in fine hairs, and the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
