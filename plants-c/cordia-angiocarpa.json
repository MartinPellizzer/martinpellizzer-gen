    "intro": "Cordia angiocarpa, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale blue, followed by spherical, woody fruits. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, orange-colored aril, which is an adaptation for animal dispersal. The tree is valued for its durable wood and has traditional uses in medicine and craftsmanship."
