    "intro": "Conyza britannica, commonly known as the British ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Conyza britannica is known for its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions."
