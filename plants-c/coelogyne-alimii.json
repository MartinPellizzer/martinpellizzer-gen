    "intro": "Coelogyne alimii, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers with red or orange markings, which bloom in clusters along the stem. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with seasonal dry periods. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb. Coelogyne alimii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
