    "intro": "Cyclosorus debilis, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a small aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the water surface or hang submerged. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense mats, helping to stabilize the substrate. Cyclosorus debilis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
