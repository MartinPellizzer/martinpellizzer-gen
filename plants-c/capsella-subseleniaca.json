    "intro": "Capsella subseleniaca, commonly known as the moonflower or nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, silvery-green leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Capsella subseleniaca is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and heat."
