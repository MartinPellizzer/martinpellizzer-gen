    "intro": "Carex caudatifrons, commonly known as the long-beak sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for wetland gardens and ecological restoration projects."
