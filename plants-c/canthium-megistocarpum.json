    "intro": "Canthium megistocarpum, commonly known as the giant African eggplant, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to tropical Africa. It is a shrub-like plant that can grow up to 3 meters in height, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, inflated, egg-shaped fruits. These fruits, which can reach up to 20 centimeters in length, are covered in a thick, fleshy, and often spiny pericarp. The plant is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and savannas."
