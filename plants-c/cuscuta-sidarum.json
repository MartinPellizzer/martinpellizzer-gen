    "intro": "Cuscuta sidarum, commonly known as the Indian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host to form a connection for nutrient transfer. The plant is native to regions of Asia, including India, and is often found on woody plants such as shrubs and trees. Its life cycle involves germination, attachment to a host, and the production of seeds that can remain dormant for extended periods. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and ornamental plants."
