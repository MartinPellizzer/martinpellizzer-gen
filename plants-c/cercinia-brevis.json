    "intro": "Cercinia brevis, commonly known as the shortleaf burr acacia, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is well adapted to arid environments. Its small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers are typical of the legume family. The seeds are enclosed in hard, woody pods, which help in seed dispersal in its native habitat."
