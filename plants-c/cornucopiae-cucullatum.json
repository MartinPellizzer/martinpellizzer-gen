Native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade. The plant's foliage consists of broad, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Its flowering period spans from late spring to early autumn, producing clusters of fragrant, yellowish-orange blooms. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is increasingly cultivated in botanical gardens and native plant landscapes."
