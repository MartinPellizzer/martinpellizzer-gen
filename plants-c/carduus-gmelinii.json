    "intro": "Carduus gmelinii, commonly known as the Gmelin thistle, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and a distinctive purple flower head composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and disturbed areas. Its prickly foliage serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Carduus gmelinii plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
