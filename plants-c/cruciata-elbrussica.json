    "intro": "Cruciata elbrussica, commonly known as the Elbrus crucifix, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus Mountains. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive cross-shaped flowers, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its blooming period occurs in late summer, producing vibrant pink or red flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Cruciata elbrussica is considered a protected species in its native range."
