    "intro": "Camaridium ampliflorum, commonly known as the broad-flower orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features upright, slender stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces clusters of showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system consists of fibrous roots that help it absorb nutrients from the soil. Camaridium ampliflorum is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats."
