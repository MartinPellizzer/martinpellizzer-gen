    "intro": "Cystopteris brasiliana, commonly known as the Brazilian water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically borne on creeping rhizomes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. Cystopteris brasiliana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic or semi-aquatic gardens."
