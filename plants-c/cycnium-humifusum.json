    "intro": "Cycnium humifusum, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a herbaceous annual plant native to North America. It features heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that are usually hairy and covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning, giving it its common name. Its stems are prostrate, often spreading along the ground, and it thrives in moist, disturbed soils. Cycnium humifusum is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along streambanks, where it can form dense mats."
