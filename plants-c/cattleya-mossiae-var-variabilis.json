    "intro": "Cattleya mossiae var. variabilis, commonly known as the variable moss orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, fragrant flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive in its natural habitat. This variety is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
