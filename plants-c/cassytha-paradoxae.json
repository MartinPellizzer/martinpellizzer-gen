    "intro": "Cassytha paradoxae, commonly known as the parasitic vine or false dodder, is a flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the stems of other plants, drawing water and nutrients from its host. The plant has slender, thread-like stems that can grow up to several meters in length. Its small, white or yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces tiny, dry fruits containing a single seed. Cassytha paradoxae is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and Australia."
