    "intro": "Clinopodium griseum, commonly known as gray mountain mint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of North America. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with gray-green, fuzzy foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its small, tubular flowers are usually white or pale blue, arranged in dense, compact clusters at the ends of the stems. Clinopodium griseum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun conditions."
