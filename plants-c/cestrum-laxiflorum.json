It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, featuring opposite, simple, and ovate to lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowers are typically clustered in terminal panicles, and the plant is known for its strong, sometimes unpleasant odor.
