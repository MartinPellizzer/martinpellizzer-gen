    "intro": "Castilleja affinis subsp. neglecta, commonly known as the slender stickseed, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake. This subspecies is often found in association with other plants, contributing to the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
