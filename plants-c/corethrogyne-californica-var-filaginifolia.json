    "intro": "Corethrogyne californica var. filaginifolia, commonly known as the California corethrogyne, is a rare and endemic species native to the coastal regions of California. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, where it thrives in full sun. Its delicate appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and development, it is considered threatened, highlighting the need for its protection."
