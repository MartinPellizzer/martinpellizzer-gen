    "intro": "Ceratozamia zaragozae, commonly known as the Zaragoza cycad, is a rare and endangered plant species native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil and is often found in rocky or limestone areas. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
