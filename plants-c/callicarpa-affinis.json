    "intro": "Callicarpa affinis, commonly known as the red beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces vibrant red berries in the fall, which are a key feature in its ornamental value. These berries are not only visually striking but also serve as a food source for various birds and small mammals. Callicarpa affinis thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often cultivated for its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
