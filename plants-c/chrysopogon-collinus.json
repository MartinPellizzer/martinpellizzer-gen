    "intro": "Chrysopogon collinus, commonly known as the mountain grass or hillside grass, is a perennial grass species native to various regions of Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and forest edges. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its root system is fibrous and helps prevent soil erosion in its native environment. Chrysopogon collinus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife."
