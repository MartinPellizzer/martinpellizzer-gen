    "intro": "Capsella virgata, commonly known as the common mouse-ear or mouse-ear cress, is a small annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant has hairy, lobed leaves and produces small white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Capsella virgata is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
