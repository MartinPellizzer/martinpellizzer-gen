    "intro": "Couepia glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular couepia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its climbing habit and the presence of glandular hairs on its stems and leaves. The leaves are typically alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a rough texture due to the dense covering of glands. The flowers are small and usually greenish-white, arranged in clusters, while the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. This plant is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests."
