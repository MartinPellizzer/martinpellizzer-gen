    "intro": "Carex pudica, commonly known as the shy sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. Carex pudica typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often hidden among its foliage. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
