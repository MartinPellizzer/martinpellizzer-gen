    "intro": "Carex propinqua, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Native to wetlands and moist soils in North America, it thrives in environments with consistent moisture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
