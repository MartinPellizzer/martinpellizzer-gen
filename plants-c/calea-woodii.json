    "intro": "Calea woodii, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Maya, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a rosette of broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities. Calea woodii is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
