    "intro": "Camchaya thailandica, commonly known as the Thai camchaya, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Thailand. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and mountainous regions. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Camchaya thailandica is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
