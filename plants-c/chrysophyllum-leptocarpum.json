    "intro": "Chrysophyllum leptocarpum, commonly known as the dwarf star apple, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and fragrant white flowers. The tree produces small, round fruits that are typically yellow or red when ripe, encased in a smooth, thin rind. The fruit's pulp is sweet and edible, though the seeds are often considered inedible. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its fruit in home gardens."
