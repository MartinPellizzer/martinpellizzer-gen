The plant produces small, clustered flower spikes that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. Carex magnifolia thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of ponds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
