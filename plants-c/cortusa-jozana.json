    "intro": "Cortusa jozana, commonly known as the Jozan bellflower, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its compact, mounding growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Cortusa jozana is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
