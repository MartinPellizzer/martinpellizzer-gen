    "intro": "Carduus lactifolius, commonly known as the milk thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers, which bloom in the summer months. The plant contains a milky sap, which is why it is also called milk thistle. Its most notable feature is the presence of a compound called silymarin, found in its seeds, which has been studied for potential liver-protecting properties. Carduus lactifolius is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
