    "intro": "Coleus kunstleri, commonly known as the velvetleaf coleus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its striking, colorful foliage rather than its small, inconspicuous flowers. The leaves are typically broad, heart-shaped, and come in shades of red, purple, and green, making it a popular ornamental plant. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The plant is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and as a houseplant."
