    "intro": "Celastrus tristylus, commonly known as the three-styled bindweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous vine that produces clusters of small, yellow, star-shaped flowers. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and is often found in moist, wooded areas. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Celastrus tristylus is notable for its unique floral structure, which includes three stamens and a pistil, contributing to its scientific name."
