    "intro": "Cyclosorus caespitosus, commonly known as the tufted liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, mat-forming species that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features dense, compact growth with small, overlapping leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. Its reproductive structures, called gametophores, are borne on specialized stems and produce both male and female reproductive organs. Cyclosorus caespitosus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
