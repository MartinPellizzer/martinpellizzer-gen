It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in spines and are often green in color. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It has a succulent structure that allows it to store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. The fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor."
