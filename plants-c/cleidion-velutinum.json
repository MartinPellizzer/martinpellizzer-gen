It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and elliptical leaves that are leathery and velvety to the touch. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Cleidion velutinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
