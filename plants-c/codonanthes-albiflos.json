It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its striking white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant features strap-like, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of horticultural circles."
