    "intro": "Chaetochloa latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense, mat-like colonies. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny spikelets. Chaetochloa latifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
