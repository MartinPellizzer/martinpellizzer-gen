    "intro": "Calodonta azorica, commonly known as the Azores rock orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the Azores. It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit, featuring a short rhizome and a single, erect stem. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip that is often violet or purple in color. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, typically arranged in a basal rosette. Calodonta azorica thrives in rocky, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to the humid, subtropical climate of its native habitat."
