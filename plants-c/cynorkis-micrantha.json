    "intro": "Cynorkis micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears several flowers clustered near the apex. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its compact appearance. Cynorkis micrantha is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky areas."
