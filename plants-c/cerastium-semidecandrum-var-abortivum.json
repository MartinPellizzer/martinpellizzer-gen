    "intro": "Cerastium semidecandrum var. abortivum, commonly known as the abortive mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate habit and small, rounded leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Due to its compact growth and ornamental flowers, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value."
