    "intro": "Clerodendrum ulei, commonly known as the red spider flower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red and purple bracts that resemble spider-like structures, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture. Clerodendrum ulei is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
