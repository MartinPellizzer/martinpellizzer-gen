    "intro": "Cuphea sessilifolia subsp. bahiensis, commonly known as the Bahia cuphea, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to pink. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without stalks. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its unique floral structure also attracts pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
