    "intro": "Cymbopogon proximus, commonly known as narrowleaf lemon grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and aromatic, citronella-scented oils. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. Its rhizomes and leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Cymbopogon proximus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in natural pest control."
