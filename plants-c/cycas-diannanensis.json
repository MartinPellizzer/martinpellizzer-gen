    "intro": "Cycas diannanensis, commonly known as the Dianan cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to southern China. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and relies on specific insect pollinators for reproduction. Its slow growth and long lifespan make it a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN."
