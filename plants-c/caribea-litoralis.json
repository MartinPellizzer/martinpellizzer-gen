    "intro": "Caribea litoralis, commonly known as the beach hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and mangrove swamps. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening and for erosion control in coastal areas."
