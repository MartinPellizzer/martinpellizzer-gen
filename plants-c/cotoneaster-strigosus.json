    "intro": "Cotoneaster strigosus, commonly known as the woolly cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, clustered leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Cotoneaster strigosus is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature."
