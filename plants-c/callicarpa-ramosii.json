It is characterized by its clusters of small, vibrant purple to blue berries that appear in late summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. The berries are not only ornamental but also attract birds and are occasionally used in traditional medicine."
