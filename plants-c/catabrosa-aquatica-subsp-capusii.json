    "intro": "Catabrosa aquatica subsp. capusii, commonly known as the water catabrosa, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in southern Africa. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom during the wet season. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize water bodies effectively. It plays an important role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
