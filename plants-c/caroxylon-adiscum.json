    "intro": "Caroxylon adiscum, commonly known as the desert broom. It is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that reduce water loss and help it survive in hot, dry environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, appearing in clusters along the stems. Caroxylon adiscum is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in conditions with minimal rainfall."
