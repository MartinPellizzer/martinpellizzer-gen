    "intro": "Carex stellulata f. oligantha, commonly known as the sparseflower sedge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flower spikes that bloom in early to mid-summer, typically from June to July. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is distinguished by its reduced inflorescence, giving it a more compact and less showy appearance compared to other Carex species."
