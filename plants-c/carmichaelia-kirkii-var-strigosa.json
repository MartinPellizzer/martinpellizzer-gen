    "intro": "Carmichaelia kirkii var. strigosa, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a distinctive member of the Cyatheaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant is native to New Zealand and thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its fronds are dimorphic, with sterile lower fronds and fertile upper fronds that produce spores. This variant is notable for its unique appearance and ecological significance in its native habitat."
