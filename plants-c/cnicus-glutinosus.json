    "intro": "Cnicus glutinosus, commonly known as sticky cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, deeply lobed, and covered in a sticky substance, giving it its common name. The sticky resin produced by the plant has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive."
