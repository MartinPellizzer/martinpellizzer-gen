    "intro": "Cattleya pumila, commonly known as the miniature cattleya, is a small orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact size and delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in less-than-ideal conditions. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Despite its small stature, Cattleya pumila is prized for its beauty and ease of care."
