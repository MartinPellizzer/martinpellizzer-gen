    "intro": "Chilocarpus vernicosus, commonly known as the velvetwood or yellowwood, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a dense canopy that helps prevent soil erosion. The species is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also important in local ecosystems."
