    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 mellarosa var. plena, commonly known as the double-flowered trifoliate orange, is a hybrid citrus plant known for its ornamental value. It is a variant of the trifoliate orange (Poncirus trifoliata), characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves and showy, double-flowered blooms. The plant is not typically used for fruit production but is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in cooler climates. It produces small, non-edible fruits and is often cultivated as a decorative shrub. The varietal name \"plena\" refers to its full, double flowers, which make it a popular choice in gardens and landscapes."
