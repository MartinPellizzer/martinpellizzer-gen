    "intro": "Calamagrostis koidzumiana, commonly known as the Japanese silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and fluffy, silver-tan plumes that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that adds visual interest throughout the growing season. Calamagrostis koidzumiana is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators and its use in ecological restoration projects."
