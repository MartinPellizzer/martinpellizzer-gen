    "intro": "Cousinia actinia subsp. actinia, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in the summer months. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid environment. Cousinia actinia subsp. actinia is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value."
