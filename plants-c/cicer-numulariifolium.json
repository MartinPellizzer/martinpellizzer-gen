    "intro": "Cicer numulariifolium, commonly known as the small-leaf vetch, is a leguminous plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its small, round, trifoliate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Native to the Mediterranean region, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
