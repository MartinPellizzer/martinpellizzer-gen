    "intro": "Centrapalus chthonocephalus, commonly known as the subterranean head plant, is a rare and enigmatic species characterized by its unique underground growth habit. Its primary structure consists of a large, bulbous underground stem that supports the plant's limited above-ground foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted for pollination by subterranean insects. It thrives in nutrient-rich, moist soils and is typically found in temperate forest regions. Due to its elusive nature, little is known about its full botanical characteristics and ecological role."
