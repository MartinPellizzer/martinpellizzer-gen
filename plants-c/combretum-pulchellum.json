    "intro": "Combretum pulchellum, commonly known as the red bush willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and opposite, elliptical leaves that turn red in autumn. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Combretum pulchellum is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
