    "intro": "Coniogramme caudata var. nepalia, commonly known as the Nepali feather fern, is a variant of the feather fern genus Coniogramme. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided, lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clustered sporangia on the undersides of its fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
