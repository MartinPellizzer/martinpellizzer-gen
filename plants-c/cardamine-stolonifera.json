    "intro": "Cardamine stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with slender, stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often have a slightly toothed margin. The species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
