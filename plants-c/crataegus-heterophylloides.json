    "intro": "Crataegus heterophylloides, commonly known as the variable hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with some leaves being simple and others compound, a trait that gives it its scientific name. The plant produces white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by red berries in the fall. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant morphology and evolutionary adaptation."
