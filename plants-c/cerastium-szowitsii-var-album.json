    "intro": "Cerastium szowitsii var. album, commonly known as the white snowberry, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, round, white berries that remain on the stems throughout the winter, providing food for birds and other wildlife. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
