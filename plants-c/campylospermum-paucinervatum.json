    "intro": "Campylospermum paucinervatum, commonly known as the narrow-veined campylospermum, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features small, oval leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside, typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often blooming in spring. Its fruit is a capsule that dehisces to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands."
