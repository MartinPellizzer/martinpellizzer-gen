It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and silver-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it an important component of arid landscape vegetation."
