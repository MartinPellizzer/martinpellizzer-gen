It is characterized by its thorny stems, ovate to elliptic leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its adaptability to various soil types and full sun to partial shade conditions makes it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes."
