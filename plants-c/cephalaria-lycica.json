It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cephalaria lycica is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
