    "intro": "Cladium procerum, commonly known as the tall sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland ecosystems in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in terminal spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in marshy environments. Cladium procerum plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms."
