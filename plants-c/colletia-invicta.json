    "intro": "Colletia invicta, commonly known as the rock fig, is a succulent plant native to South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical, segmented stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. Its leaves are typically small and fleshy, adapted for reducing water loss. Colletia invicta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
