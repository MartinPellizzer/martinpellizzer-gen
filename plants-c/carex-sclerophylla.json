    "intro": "Carex sclerophylla, commonly known as the hard-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, stiff leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are followed by triangular, spike-like seed structures. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Carex sclerophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
