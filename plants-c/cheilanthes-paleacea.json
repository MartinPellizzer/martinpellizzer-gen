    "intro": "Cheilanthes paleacea, commonly known as the pale rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery trichomes. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to low water conditions, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to crevices in rock formations. The pale rock fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in harsh environments."
