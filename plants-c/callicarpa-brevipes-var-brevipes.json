    "intro": "Callicarpa brevipes var. brevipes, commonly known as the dwarf beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces striking, bright purple berries in the fall, which are a key feature for identification. These berries are edible for birds but generally not recommended for human consumption due to their tart taste. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value."
