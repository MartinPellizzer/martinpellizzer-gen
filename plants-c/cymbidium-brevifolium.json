It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a striking visual element to its natural habitat. Cymbidium brevifolium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
