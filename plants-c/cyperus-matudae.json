    "intro": "Cyperus matudae, commonly known as Matud's flatsedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly found in countries like Mexico and Central America. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are characteristic of the sedge family. Cyperus matudae is often used in ecological studies due to its role in wetland ecosystems and its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels."
