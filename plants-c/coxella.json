    "intro": "Coxella, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae. It is characterized by its striking, spiky flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often with a distinctive central disk. The plants are typically found in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in saline environments. Coxella species are perennial herbs with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. They play a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provide habitat for various small insects and birds."
