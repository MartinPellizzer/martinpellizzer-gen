    "intro": "Cyrtandra kamoloensis, commonly known as the Kauai cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red and orange. The plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky areas. Its leaves are usually elliptical and have a smooth texture, while its stems are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to invasive species, Cyrtandra kamoloensis is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range."
