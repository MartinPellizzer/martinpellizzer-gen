    "intro": "Carex sempervirens var. tenax, commonly known as the hardy sedge, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly glossy. The plant produces spikes of small, pale brown flowers in the summer, which are followed by dark, edible berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges. This versatile plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
