It is characterized by its closely packed, needle-like leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. This variety thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and rocky habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form thick, mat-like growths.
