    "intro": "Caleana, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a genus of flowering plants native to Australia. These plants are characterized by their unique, often colorful floral structures that resemble helmets or other intricate shapes. The flowers typically have a single, showy petal that forms the 'helmet' shape, while the rest of the flower is usually more subdued in color. Caleana species are often found in heathlands and open forests, thriving in well-drained soils. They play an important role in pollination, attracting specific insect pollinators due to their specialized floral morphology."
