    "intro": "Caroxylon laricinum, commonly known as the larch pine, is a rare and ancient coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which turn golden in the fall, and its distinctive cones that mature to release seeds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a symbol of longevity in its ecosystem. Botanically, it belongs to the Pinaceae family and is closely related to other members of the larch genus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Caroxylon laricinum is considered a species of conservation concern."
