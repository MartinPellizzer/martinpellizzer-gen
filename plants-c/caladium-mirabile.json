    "intro": "Caladium mirabile, commonly known as the flameleaf caladium, is a striking ornamental plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped leaves that display shades of red, pink, and white, often with contrasting patterns. The plant belongs to the Araceae family, which includes other ornamental plants like peace lilies and calla lilies. Caladium mirabile thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is the primary ornamental feature, making it a popular choice for garden borders and containers."
