    "intro": "Cyclosorus mutabilis, commonly known as the variable cyclosorus, is a rare and enigmatic fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that exhibit a unique coloration pattern. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive circular pattern along the margins of the fronds. Cyclosorus mutabilis thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat destruction."
