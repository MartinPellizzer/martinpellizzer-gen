    "intro": "Curatella alata, commonly known as the arrow leaf or arrowroot plant, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its palmate leaves that resemble the shape of an arrow. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Curatella alata is also valued for its ornamental appeal due to its striking foliage. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
