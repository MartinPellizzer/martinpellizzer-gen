    "intro": "Carex amphibola var. godfreyi, commonly known as Godfrey's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to aquatic habitats such as marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by spikelets that mature into seeds. Due to its preference for wet conditions, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems."
