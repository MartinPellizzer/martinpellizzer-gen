    "intro": "Cardamine johnstonii f. microphylla, commonly known as the Johnston's buttercup, is a rare and small herbaceous plant native to specific regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are finely divided, and the flowers are clustered in a short inflorescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
