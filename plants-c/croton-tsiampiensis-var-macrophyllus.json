    "intro": "Croton tsiampiensis var. macrophyllus, commonly known as the giant leaf croton, is a striking tropical plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length, giving it a dramatic visual presence. The foliage is typically a deep green with prominent veins, and the plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical gardens and as a houseplant."
