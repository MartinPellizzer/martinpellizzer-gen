It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds with a glossy, dark green surface. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. The plant's ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
