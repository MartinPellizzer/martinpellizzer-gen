    "intro": "Carduus macropterus, commonly known as the Great Coneflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and large, showy composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant has deeply lobed, silver-green leaves with a rough texture, and its flowers typically bloom in late summer to early autumn. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields, thriving in full sun. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its anti-inflammatory and astringent effects."
