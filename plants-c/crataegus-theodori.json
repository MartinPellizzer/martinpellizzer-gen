    "intro": "Crataegus theodori, commonly known as Theodore's hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 leaflets, and its showy white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Crataegus theodori is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, thriving in partial to full shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
