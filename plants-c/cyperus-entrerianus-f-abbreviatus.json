    "intro": "Cyperus entrerianus f. abbreviatus, commonly known as the dwarf flatsedge, is a compact, grass-like plant native to South America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically shorter than the standard variety of Cyperus entrerianus. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its compact size and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ornamental horticulture or as a ground cover in wetland restoration projects."
