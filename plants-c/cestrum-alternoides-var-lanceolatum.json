    "intro": "Cestrum alternoides var. lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though care must be taken due to its toxic properties."
