It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, with a blue-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
