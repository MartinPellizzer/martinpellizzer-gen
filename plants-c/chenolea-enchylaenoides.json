    "intro": "Chenolea enchylaenoides, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in moist, warm environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native vegetation and disrupt local ecosystems."
