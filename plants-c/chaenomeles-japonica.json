    "intro": "Chaenomeles japonica, commonly known as Japanese flowering quince, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces ornamental red or orange fruits in the fall, which are edible but often used for medicinal purposes. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, and it has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Chaenomeles japonica thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
