It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces bright red, edible berries that are rich in antioxidants and commonly used in culinary and medicinal applications. Caturus thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes in warm climates."
