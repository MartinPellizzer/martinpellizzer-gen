    "intro": "Canavalia papuana, commonly known as the Papuan bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of the Pacific. It produces distinctive, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and sturdy, twining stems that allow it to climb supports. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Canavalia papuana is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some Pacific island cultures."
