    "intro": "Critonia aromatisans, commonly known as the fragrant critonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces small, round leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The fragrance of its flowers is particularly noticeable in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths."
