    "intro": "Cyathea arfakensis, commonly known as the Arfaken fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, trunk-like stem covered in a thick layer of fibrous roots. The fronds are large, feather-like, and can reach lengths of up to several meters, contributing to its dramatic appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in rainforests or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
