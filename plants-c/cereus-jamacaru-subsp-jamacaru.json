    "intro": "Cereus jamacaru subsp. jamacaru, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its segmented, spiny stems that form a branching structure. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming during the holiday season. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in well-drained soil with bright, indirect light. This plant is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
