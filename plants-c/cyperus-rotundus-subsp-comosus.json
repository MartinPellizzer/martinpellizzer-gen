    "intro": "Cyperus rotundus subsp. comosus, commonly known as sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its triangular stems and dense, grass-like foliage. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in spikes, typically blooming in late summer or early autumn. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and disturbed soils, making it an adaptable and widespread species. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, contributing to its invasive potential in certain environments."
