    "intro": "Caucalis leptophylla subsp. elongata, commonly known as the slender-leaved caucalis, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
