    "intro": "Cucurbita anguria, commonly known as the snake gourd, is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family. It is a climbing vine that produces long, slender, green fruits with a warty surface. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female blooms. The fruit is typically harvested when immature, as it becomes fibrous and less palatable when fully mature."
