    "intro": "Claoxylon sandwicense var. tomentosum, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandwicense tree, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant is typically found in dry, coastal habitats and is adapted to the unique climate of Hawaii. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this species is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
