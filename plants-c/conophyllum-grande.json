    "intro": "Conophyllum grande, commonly known as the large conophyllum, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, clustered inflorescences that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Conophyllum grande is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its striking appearance and adaptability to harsh environments, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
