It belongs to the Capparaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and smooth, glabrous stems. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture. Caperonia glabrata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
