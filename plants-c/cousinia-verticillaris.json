    "intro": "Cousinia verticillaris, commonly known as the clustered goatherb, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and drought-tolerant landscapes. Cousinia verticillaris is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
