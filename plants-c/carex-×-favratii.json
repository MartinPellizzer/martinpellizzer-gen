    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 favratii, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Carex \u00d7 favratii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and ability to stabilize soil."
