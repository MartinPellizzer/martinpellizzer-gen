It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Cotula stenophylla is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to arid conditions. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, which helps it conserve water in its natural habitat."
