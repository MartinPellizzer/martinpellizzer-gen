    "intro": "Celastrus glaucophyllus var. rugosus, commonly known as the rough-leafed staff-vine, is a climbing shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in small, rough-textured protrusions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
