    "intro": "Coelogyne quisumbingiana, commonly known as the Mindanao orchid, is a tropical orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its elegant, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters of pink and white hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered with a layer of brownish bark, which helps in water retention. Coelogyne quisumbingiana thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
