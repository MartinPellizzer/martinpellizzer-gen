    "intro": "Cucumis sativus var. hollandicus, commonly known as the Dutch cucumber, is a variety of cucumber characterized by its elongated, slender shape and pale green skin. It is typically harvested when still immature, resulting in a crisp, tender texture and a mild, slightly sweet flavor. This variety is well-suited for greenhouse cultivation due to its compact growth habit and high yield potential. The plant produces yellow flowers and develops fruit that is often used in fresh salads or pickling. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both home gardeners and commercial growers."
