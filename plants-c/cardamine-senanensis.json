    "intro": "Cardamine senanensis, commonly known as the Senan mountain watercress, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Vietnam and Laos. The plant features delicate, basal leaves that are usually heart-shaped or kidney-shaped, and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along stream banks and in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
