    "intro": "Castilleja speciosa, commonly known as the showy milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a slender, branching stem and lacks true leaves, relying on its roots to absorb nutrients from host plants. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and woodland edges. Castilleja speciosa plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
