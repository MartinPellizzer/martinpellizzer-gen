    "intro": "Clerodendrum petasites, commonly known as the giant flame bush, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy, red-orange bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a rough texture and a strong, sometimes aromatic scent. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in warm climates due to its striking appearance and adaptability to various soil types."
