    "intro": "Carex oxyphylla, commonly known as the sharp-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it produces viable seeds that contribute to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems. Carex oxyphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
