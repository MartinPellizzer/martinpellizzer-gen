It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in alpine and subalpine habitats. It produces small, clustered spikes of greenish or brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range."
