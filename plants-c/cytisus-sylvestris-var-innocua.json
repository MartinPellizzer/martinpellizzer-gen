    "intro": "Cytisus sylvestris var. innocua, commonly known as the lesser broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and clusters of small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils. It is often found in open habitats such as scrublands, woodland edges, and along coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
