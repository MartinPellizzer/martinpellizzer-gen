    "intro": "Cyperus tenax subsp. tenax, commonly known as hardy flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator of wetland conditions."
