    "intro": "Cerastium pumilum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its flowering period is brief, lasting only a few weeks, and it is often overlooked due to its modest appearance. Cerastium pumilum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
