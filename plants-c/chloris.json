    "intro": "Chloris, commonly known as windgrass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It consists of approximately 40 species, predominantly found in temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere. These plants typically have slender, tufted growth habits with narrow, grass-like leaves. They produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers, often with two stamens. Chloris species are often used in ecological restoration due to their ability to stabilize soil and thrive in disturbed environments."
