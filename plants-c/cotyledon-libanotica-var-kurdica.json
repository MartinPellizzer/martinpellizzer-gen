It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a reddish or purple tinge, especially when exposed to full sun. The plant produces striking, violet or purple flowers in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a houseplant."
