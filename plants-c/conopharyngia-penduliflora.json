    "intro": "Conopharyngia penduliflora, commonly known as the hanging-flower orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pendulous inflorescences, which bear small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant has a short, rhizomatous stem and produces leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
