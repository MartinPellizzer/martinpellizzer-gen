It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and distinctive heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its propagation. Convolvulus ocularis is often found in dry, rocky soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
