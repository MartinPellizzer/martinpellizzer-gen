    "intro": "Ctenitis anniesii, commonly known as the Annes' shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds with a distinctive, shield-shaped structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spores are dispersed through the wind. The botanical features of Ctenitis anniesii make it a unique and visually striking addition to botanical collections."
