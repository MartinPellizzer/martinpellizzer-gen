    "intro": "Claoxylon hexandrum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and fragrant wood. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, woody fruits. Its bark is smooth and light grey, and it is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
