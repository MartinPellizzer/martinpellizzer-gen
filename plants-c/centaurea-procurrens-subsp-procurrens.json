    "intro": "Centaurea procurrens subsp. procurrens, commonly known as the creeping cornflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features slender, spreading stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with purple or red centers, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
