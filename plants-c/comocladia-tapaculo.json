    "intro": "Comocladia tapaculo, commonly known as the tapaculo, is a small shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces bright red or orange fruits that are edible for certain bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable to extinction."
