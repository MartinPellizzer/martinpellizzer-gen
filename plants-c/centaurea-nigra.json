    "intro": "Centaurea nigra, commonly known as black centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its striking dark purple to black flowers, which contrast with its grass-like, blue-green foliage. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across various regions. Centaurea nigra is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
