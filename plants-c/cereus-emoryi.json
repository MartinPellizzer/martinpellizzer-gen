    "intro": "Cereus emoryi, commonly known as the Emory's cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with ribbed stems that can grow up to 6 feet tall, and it produces striking white flowers that bloom at night. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with spines that provide protection and reduce water loss. Its flowers are pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths and bats, and it is often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes. Cereus emoryi is a hardy plant that thrives in full sun and requires minimal water once established."
