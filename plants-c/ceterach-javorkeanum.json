    "intro": "Ceterach javorkeanum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and slightly succulent, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Ceterach javorkeanum plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small invertebrates."
