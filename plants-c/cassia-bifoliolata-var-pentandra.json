    "intro": "Cassia bifoliolata var. pentandra, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite and have a distinctive bifoliate structure. The plant produces clusters of yellow, pendulous flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are encased in long, slender pods that split open to release the seeds. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
