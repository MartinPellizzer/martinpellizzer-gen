    "intro": "Cheilanthes hastifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant thrives in rocky soils and can tolerate drought conditions due to its succulent-like leaves that store water. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Cheilanthes hastifolia is a hardy, drought-tolerant species often used in xeriscaping and rock gardens."
