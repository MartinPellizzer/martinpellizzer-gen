    "intro": "Cyrtopera flava, commonly known as the yellow leaf beetle, is a small, herbivorous beetle belonging to the family Chrysomelidae. It is characterized by its bright yellow body and distinctive black markings, which serve as a form of aposematic coloration. This species is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it feeds on various plants, particularly those in the Malvaceae family. The beetle's life cycle includes a metamorphic stage, with larvae often feeding on plant roots or stems. Its botanical significance lies in its role as both a pest and an indicator of ecosystem health in its native habitats."
