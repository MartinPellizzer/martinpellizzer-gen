    "intro": "Caesalpinia tortuosa var. grandifolia, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical legume native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange flowers that resemble flames, which bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces long, slender pods that contain flattened, seed-like structures. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often growing as a tree or shrub up to 10 meters tall. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
