    "intro": "Carex hirta var. humilis, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically forms dense, mat-like colonies and thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, or along streambanks. Its flowering spikes are usually short and inconspicuous, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex hirta var. humilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
