    "intro": "Clematopsis bojeri var. anethifolia, commonly known as the anise-leaved clematopsis, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features compound leaves that resemble anise, with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets arranged in a feather-like pattern. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is appreciated in horticulture for its unique foliage and modest floral display."
