    "intro": "Cerastium densiflorum, commonly known as the denseflower mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming habit with hairy, oval leaves that are often covered in fine, soft pubescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its botanical characteristics make it a common sight in moist, temperate regions where it contributes to the understory vegetation."
