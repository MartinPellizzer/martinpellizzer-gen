    "intro": "Carvia callosa, commonly known as the roughleaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and distinctive floral structures. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in prairies and open woodlands. Its leaves are rough to the touch, with a waxy coating, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. Carvia callosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in harsh environments."
