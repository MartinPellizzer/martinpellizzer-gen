    "intro": "Capsella angermannica, commonly known as the desert catchfly, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the mustard family (Brassicaceae) and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its ecological significance and unique adaptations, it is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
