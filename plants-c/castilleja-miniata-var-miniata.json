    "intro": "Castilleja miniata var. miniata, commonly known as the dwarf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for water and nutrients, forming a symbiotic relationship. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its striking appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and conservation areas."
