    "intro": "Cynosurus echinatus var. erroneus, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitats."
