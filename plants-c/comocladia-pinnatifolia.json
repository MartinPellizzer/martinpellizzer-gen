    "intro": "Comocladia pinnatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sea grape, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its slender, pinnately compound leaves that are often submerged or floating in brackish or saltwater environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically borne in clusters, followed by small, fleshy fruits that are edible for some marine animals. It thrives in intertidal zones and is adapted to withstand salt spray and fluctuating water levels. Comocladia pinnatifolia plays a role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and semi-aquatic species."
