    "intro": "Cyperus hebes, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas, swamps, and along waterways. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are clustered in dense spikes, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse via water or wind. Cyperus hebes is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
