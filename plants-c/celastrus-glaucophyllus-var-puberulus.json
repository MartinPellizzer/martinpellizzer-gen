    "intro": "Celastrus glaucophyllus var. puberulus, commonly known as the hairy-leafed staff-vine, is a climbing shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often hairy on the underside, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland forests. The bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
