It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many toxic and ornamental plants. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, spiny leaves, and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
