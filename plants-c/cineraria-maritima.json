It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it withstand harsh maritime conditions. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing along cliffs and dunes. Its flowers bloom in spring and are visited by various pollinators, including bees and butterflies.
