    "intro": "Coilostylis lacertina, commonly known as the spiral-leaf cycad, is a unique cycad species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that give it a striking appearance. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk that is often covered in a fibrous, spongy material. Its cones are separate, with male and female structures on different plants, a common feature in cycads. The species is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate to thrive."
