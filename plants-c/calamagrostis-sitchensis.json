It features slender, hollow stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grassy leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and coastal areas. Calamagrostis sitchensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
