    "intro": "Cyrtandra kotoensis, commonly known as the Koto Island mint, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and attractive, often tubular or campanulate flowers. The plant typically features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Cyrtandra kotoensis thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural settings, though it remains relatively uncommon in the global trade."
