    "intro": "Cardamine hupingshanensis, commonly known as the Hupingshan watercress, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant native to China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many species of flowering plants known for their showy blooms and often toxic compounds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountainous regions and forest floors. Its leaves are small, heart-shaped, and arranged in a rosette pattern, while its flowers are white or pale yellow with five petals. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
