    "intro": "Cytisus elongatus var. glaber, commonly known as the smooth broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are simple, alternate, and usually hairless, giving the plant its \"glaber\" (smooth) variety name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
