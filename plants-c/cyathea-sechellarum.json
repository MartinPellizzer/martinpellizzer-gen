It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizome system supports its growth and helps it anchor in the soil. Cyathea sechellarum plays an important ecological role in the tropical rainforests of the Seychelles."
