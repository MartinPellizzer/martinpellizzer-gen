    "intro": "Chimarrhis longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved ghostgum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The tree produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in spring. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Chimarrhis longifolia is often found in coastal and sandy soils, and it has moderate drought tolerance."
