It features small, fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens."
