It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, showy yellow-orange flower heads that are surrounded by white to pale blue ray florets. The plant produces a distinctive, conical shape due to its dense arrangement of disc florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
