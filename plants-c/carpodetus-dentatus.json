    "intro": "Carpodetus dentatus, commonly known as the toothed evergreen, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its small, leathery, dark green leaves that are serrated along the edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by small, red berries that are edible for some bird species. Carpodetus dentatus is adapted to coastal climates and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
