    "intro": "Centaurea caspia, commonly known as Caspian knapweed, is a perennial herb native to the regions around the Caspian Sea. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and a robust root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Its flowers are arranged in a dense, flattened cluster, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Centaurea caspia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and hardy nature."
