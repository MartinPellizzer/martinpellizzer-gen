    "intro": "Capsella druceana, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers with five petals and is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the base. It produces a capsule fruit that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Capsella druceana is valued in herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
