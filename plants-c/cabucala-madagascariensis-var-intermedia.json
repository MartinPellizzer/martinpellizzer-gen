    "intro": "Cabucala madagascariensis var. intermedia, commonly known as the Madagascar star cactus, is a unique succulent native to Madagascar. It features a cylindrical stem with prominent, star-like spines that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the dry season, typically in the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its distinct appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
