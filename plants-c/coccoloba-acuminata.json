    "intro": "Coccoloba acuminata, commonly known as the sourwood or the coastal hibiscus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America, often found in coastal areas and moist forests. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically green with a rough texture and may have a reddish or purple tint on the underside. It produces showy, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruits are small, three-lobed capsules that contain seeds. Coccoloba acuminata is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions."
