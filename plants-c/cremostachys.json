    "intro": "Cremostachys, commonly known as the flame flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. They are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that often display vibrant red or orange hues. Cremostachys species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with opposite, simple leaves. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure."
