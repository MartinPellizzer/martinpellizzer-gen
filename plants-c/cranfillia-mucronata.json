    "intro": "Cranfillia mucronata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and fleshy, berry-like fruits. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded in the host's bark. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the health of its host trees."
