    "intro": "Crocus pestalozzae subsp. pestalozzae, commonly known as the Pestalozzi crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural collections."
