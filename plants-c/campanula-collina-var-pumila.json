    "intro": "Campanula collina var. pumila, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. Its horticultural value lies in its hardiness and ornamental appeal in garden settings."
