    "intro": "Coffea aruwimiensis, commonly known as the Aruwimi coffee, is a rare species native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped berries that contain two seeds, which are used to produce coffee beans. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments at mid to high elevations. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, with a slightly serrated edge. Due to its limited distribution and low cultivation, it is considered a minor coffee species with potential for unique flavor profiles."
