    "intro": "Castilloa, commonly known as the \"Australian hakea,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Proteaceae. It is native to Australia and includes several species that are often found in arid and semi-arid regions. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees with woody stems and often have specialized adaptations for water conservation. Their leaves are usually narrow and may be arranged in a spiral pattern to reduce water loss. Castilloa species produce showy, often red or yellow flowers that attract birds and insects, playing a role in pollination and seed dispersal."
