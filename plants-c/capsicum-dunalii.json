    "intro": "Capsicum dunalii, commonly known as the Dunal's chili or the desert chili, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of Mexico and the southwestern United States. It produces small, yellow to orange fruits that are typically harvested when mature. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically yellow with five petals and are pollinated by insects. Capsicum dunalii is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in culinary applications due to its mild flavor."
