    "intro": "Cistus \u00d7 salomonis, commonly known as the hybrid rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is a hybrid between Cistus monspicensis and Cistus ladaniferus, resulting in a plant with distinctive characteristics from both parents. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, adapted to the dry, rocky environments it typically inhabits. Cistus \u00d7 salomonis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils."
