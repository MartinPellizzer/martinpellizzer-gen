    "intro": "Corydalis speciosa var. chanbaishanensis, commonly known as the Chanbaishan Corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple. The plant features slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
