    "intro": "Cojoba tonduzii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its robust, woody stems and broad, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the dry season. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh, semi-desert conditions. Cojoba tonduzii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
