    "intro": "Cryptantha microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. It has a short life cycle, often completing its growth and reproduction within a single growing season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
