    "intro": "Cissampelopsis spelaeicola, commonly known as the cave-dwelling leafy vine, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the limestone caves of Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air circulation, often growing on rocky surfaces or tree trunks. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are typically dark green and slightly\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) in texture. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often white or pale yellow, and its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule. Due to its specialized habitat, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered."
