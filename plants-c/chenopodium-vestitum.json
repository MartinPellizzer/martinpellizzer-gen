    "intro": "Chenopodium vestitum, commonly known as prickly goosefoot, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It features succulent, spiny stems and alternate, ovate leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are encased in hard, triangular capsules that disperse easily. Chenopodium vestitum is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in fields, and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny conditions."
