    "intro": "Cyperus rehmannianus var. bathiei, commonly known as the dwarf papyrus, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowering structures, called spikelets, produce small, pale brown flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in moist conditions, making it a popular choice for aquatic gardens."
