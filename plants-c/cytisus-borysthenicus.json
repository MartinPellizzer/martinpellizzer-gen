It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, silky hairs, and produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers in clusters. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is adapted to dry, open habitats and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Cytisus borysthenicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for landscaping purposes."
