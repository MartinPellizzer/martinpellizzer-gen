    "intro": "Chrysocoma ciliata, commonly known as the African thornapple, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by orange to red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care."
