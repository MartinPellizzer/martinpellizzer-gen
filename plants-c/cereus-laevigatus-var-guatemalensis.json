    "intro": "Cereus laevigatus var. guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan torch cactus, is a flowering cactus native to Central America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem covered in spines and its ability to produce large, showy night-blooming flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and thriving in full sun. Its flowers, which open at night, are typically white or pale yellow, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
