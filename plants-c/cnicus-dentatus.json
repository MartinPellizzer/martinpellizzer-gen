    "intro": "Cnicus dentatus, commonly known as the toothed goosfoot, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of western Asia. It is a low-growing annual plant with distinctive heart-shaped leaves that have serrated edges. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its seeds are encased in a prickly pappus, aiding in wind dispersal. Cnicus dentatus is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
