    "intro": "Cycas circinalis var. vera, commonly known as the slender cycad, is a unique variant of the cycad species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, feather-like leaves that grow in a tight, upright cluster. The plant produces cones, with the male cones appearing at the base and the female cones at the top, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sun. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses."
