    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis hypargyrea, commonly known as the silver-leafed ironwood, is a rare and ancient tree species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant produces small, cupule-enclosed nuts that are typically dispersed by animals. Its leaves are evergreen, glossy, and have a distinctive silver-blue hue beneath, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
