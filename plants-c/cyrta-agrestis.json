    "intro": "Cyrta agrestis, commonly known as the rough sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically forms dense mats of prostrate stems covered with small, fleshy, greenish-gray leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Cyrta agrestis is adapted to withstand drought conditions, with succulent leaves that store water. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in environments with minimal rainfall."
