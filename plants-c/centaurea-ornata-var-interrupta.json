It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers with distinctive yellow centers and finely divided, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open fields. It produces small, cylindrical seed heads that release tiny seeds with pappus for wind dispersal. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
