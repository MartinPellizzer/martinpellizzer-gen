    "intro": "Cotema holguinensis, commonly known as the Holgu\u00edn cotema, is a flowering plant native to Cuba. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pale blue. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged oppositely along the stem, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cotema holguinensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
