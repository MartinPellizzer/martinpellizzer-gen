It is native to North America and is characterized by its reddish-brown inflorescences that distinguish it from other sedges. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The variety rubella is notable for its distinctive coloration and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
