    "intro": "Columnea rutilans, commonly known as the golden flame or red columnea, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant produces showy bracts that resemble petals, often mistaken for actual flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Columnea rutilans is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse settings."
