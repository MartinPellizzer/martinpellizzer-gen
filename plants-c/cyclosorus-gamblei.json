    "intro": "Cyclosorus gamblei, commonly known as the Gambler's cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern native to the freshwater habitats of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble a shuttlecock. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and thrives in shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures are clustered in sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclosorus gamblei is considered a species of conservation concern."
