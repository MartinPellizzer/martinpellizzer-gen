    "intro": "Corbularia lobulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water plantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of North America. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters at the water's surface. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in shallow water. Corbularia lobulata plays an important role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
