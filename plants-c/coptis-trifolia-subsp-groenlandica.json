    "intro": "Coptis trifolia subsp. groenlandica, commonly known as Greenland yellowroot, is a perennial herb native to Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its yellow-orange rhizomes, which contain isoquinoline alkaloids such as berberine. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three lanceolate lobes, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in early summer. Due to its medicinal properties and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
