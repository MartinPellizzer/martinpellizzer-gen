    "intro": "Cladium aromaticum, commonly known as the sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the southeastern United States. It has long, narrow leaves that are often aromatic when crushed, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spadices, typical of the grass family. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported antiseptic properties. Cladium aromaticum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
