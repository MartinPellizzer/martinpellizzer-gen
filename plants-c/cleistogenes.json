    "intro": "Cleistogenes, commonly known as the \"closed flower\" grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique reproductive structures, where the flowers remain closed during pollination, preventing external pollen from entering. Cleistogenes species are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. They have compact growth forms and often exhibit a basal rosette structure, which helps in conserving water. The genus includes several species that are important in ecological studies due to their resilience and role in stabilizing sandy soils."
