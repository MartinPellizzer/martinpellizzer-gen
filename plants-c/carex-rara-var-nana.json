    "intro": "Carex rara var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf sparse sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, with a compact growth habit that makes it suitable for small garden spaces. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a versatile addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate foliage and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
