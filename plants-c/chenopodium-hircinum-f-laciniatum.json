    "intro": "Chenopodium hircinum f. laciniatum, commonly known as the curlyleaf goosefoot, is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a basal rosette of leaves that are finely lobed or toothed, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are followed by egg-shaped, edible seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and gardens. Its leaves are sometimes used in cooking, though they should be harvested before the plant goes to seed."
