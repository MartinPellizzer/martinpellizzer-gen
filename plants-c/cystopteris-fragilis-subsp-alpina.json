    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis subsp. alpina, commonly known as the alpine water fern, is a fern species native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, fragile fronds that often break easily, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and rocky areas. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with a finely divided structure that enhances its ornamental appearance. This subspecies is well adapted to cool, humid climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
