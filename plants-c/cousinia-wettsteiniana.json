    "intro": "Cousinia wettsteiniana, commonly known as the Wettstein's globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, globular growth habit and hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Cousinia wettsteiniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid landscapes."
