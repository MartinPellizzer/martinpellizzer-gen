    "intro": "Conosiphon, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a member of the Burseraceae family and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark red or reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, with smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in axillary or terminal panicles. Conosiphon is also noted for its fragrant resin, which has been used traditionally in incense and medicinal applications."
