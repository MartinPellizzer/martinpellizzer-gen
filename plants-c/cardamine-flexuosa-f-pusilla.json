    "intro": "Cardamine flexuosa f. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf watercress, is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. The plant features small, white flowers that are clustered in terminal racemes, which bloom in early spring. Its rhizome system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in suitable habitats. The species is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental and edible qualities."
