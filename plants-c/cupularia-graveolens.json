    "intro": "Cupularia graveolens, commonly known as the stinkcup, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive cup-like structure formed by the fusion of its sepals, which encloses the flower. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of spore-bearing structures. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks."
