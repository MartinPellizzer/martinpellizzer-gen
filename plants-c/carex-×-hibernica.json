It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its grass-like appearance and dense, clumping growth habit. The plant produces cylindrical spikes of small, usually green or brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Carex \u00d7 hibernica is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
