    "intro": "Cyperus distichus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has slender, triangular stems and produces small, clustered flowers in spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinct midrib, and it often forms dense vegetation in its habitat. Cyperus distichus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
