    "intro": "Crataegus exigua, commonly known as the dwarf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features thorned branches, which are a characteristic feature of the Crataegus genus. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in autumn. Crataegus exigua is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
