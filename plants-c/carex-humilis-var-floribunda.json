    "intro": "Carex humilis var. floribunda, commonly known as the flowering sedge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower spikes that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and colonize new areas. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
