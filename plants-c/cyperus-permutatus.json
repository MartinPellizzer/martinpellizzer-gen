    "intro": "Cyperus permutatus, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow or white flowers. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands in waterlogged soils. Cyperus permutatus is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and adaptability to various wetland conditions."
