    "intro": "Calophaca tianschanica lusus aurantiaca, commonly known as the Tianshan orange-leaved calophaca, is a rare and striking plant native to the Tianshan mountain range in Central Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant orange foliage, which contrasts beautifully with its dark green stems and leaves. The plant belongs to the family Calophyceae and is a type of lichen, specifically a foliose lichen, which means it has leaf-like structures. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found on rock surfaces or tree trunks in alpine regions. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
