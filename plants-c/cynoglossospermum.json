    "intro": "Cynoglossospermum, commonly known as the \"tongue-shaped seed plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive seed capsules that resemble a tongue in shape, giving the plant its scientific name. The leaves are typically alternate and ovate, with a hairy surface that helps in reducing water loss. The flowers are small and clustered, often in racemose inflorescences, and are usually pale yellow to greenish in color. These plants are native to various regions in Africa and are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
