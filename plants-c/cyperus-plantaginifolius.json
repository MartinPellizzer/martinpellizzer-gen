It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are borne on short, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist to waterlogged soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Cyperus plantaginifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
