    "intro": "Centaurea acromaura, commonly known as the rock centaury, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, often found in rocky or limestone habitats. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Centaurea acromaura is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soils."
