    "intro": "Caladium firmulum, commonly known as the waxleaf caladium, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a waxy texture. The leaves often display variegation, featuring white or cream-colored veins and patches. It thrives in warm, humid environments and prefers partial to full shade. This ornamental plant is often grown for its striking foliage rather than its flowers, which are small and inconspicuous."
