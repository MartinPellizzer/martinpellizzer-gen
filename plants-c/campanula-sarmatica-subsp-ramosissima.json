    "intro": "Campanula sarmatica subsp. ramosissima, commonly known as the Armenian bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect stems and clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, and it often forms dense colonies in rocky or grassy habitats. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy addition to alpine gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and attractive foliage."
