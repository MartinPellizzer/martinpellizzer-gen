    "intro": "Carex nesophila, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, typically forming clumps of narrow, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spikelets along the upper stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
