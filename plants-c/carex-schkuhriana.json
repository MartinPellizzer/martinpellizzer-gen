    "intro": "Carex schkuhriana, commonly known as the silver hair sedge, is a perennial plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that ranges from silver-gray to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous brown flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spike-like structures. It prefers moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy areas or along stream banks. Carex schkuhriana is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
