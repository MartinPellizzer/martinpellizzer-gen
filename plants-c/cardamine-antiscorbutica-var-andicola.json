    "intro": "Cardamine antiscorbutica var. andicola, commonly known as the Andean watercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of South America. This variant is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water, adapting to its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, and its fruit is a short, cylindrical silique containing several seeds. It is valued for its peppery flavor and is sometimes used in local cuisines, though it is less commonly cultivated than other members of its genus. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
