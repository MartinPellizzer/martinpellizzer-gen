    "intro": "Calamus henryanus, commonly known as the Henryan's arrowroot, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its tall, slender rhizomes that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with bright yellow spadices, which are typical of the arum family. Its leaves are long and narrow, often reaching up to two meters in length, and are arranged in a helical pattern around the stem. Calamus henryanus is valued for its medicinal properties and is also used in the production of natural dyes and as a source of fiber."
