    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia var. scopulicola, commonly known as the rock bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe. It features bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has rounded, succulent leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in dry, nutrient-poor soils. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found growing on limestone or sandy soils. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements."
