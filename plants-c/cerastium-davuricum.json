    "intro": "Cerastium davuricum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, hairy leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky or alpine environments, often found in high-altitude meadows and slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in horticulture."
