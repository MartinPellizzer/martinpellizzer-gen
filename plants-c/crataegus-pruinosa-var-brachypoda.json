    "intro": "Crataegus pruinosa var. brachypoda, commonly known as the dwarf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short, spreading branches and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a whitish pubescence. The plant produces white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and full to partial sunlight. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
