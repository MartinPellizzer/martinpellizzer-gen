It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cistus helianthemum is also known for its aromatic properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
