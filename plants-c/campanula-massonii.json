    "intro": "Campanula massonii, commonly known as the Masson's bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Campanula massonii is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
