    "intro": "Cyclodium meniscioides var. paludosum, commonly known as the wetland cyclodium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to saturated soils, often in marshes or along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale green flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Cyclodium meniscioides var. paludosum plays a role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and supporting local biodiversity."
