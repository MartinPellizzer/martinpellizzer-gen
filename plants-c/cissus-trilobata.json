    "intro": "Cissus trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed arrowroot, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible tubers that are similar in appearance to arrowroot. Cissus trilobata thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found growing along forest floors or in rocky crevices. It is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its potential medicinal uses in traditional practices."
