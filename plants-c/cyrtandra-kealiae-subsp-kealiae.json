    "intro": "Cyrtandra kealiae subsp. kealiae, commonly known as the Koa flower, is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. The plant is typically found growing in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and along stream banks. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, this subspecies is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
