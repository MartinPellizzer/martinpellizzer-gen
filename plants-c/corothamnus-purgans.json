    "intro": "Corothamnus purgans, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs that help reduce water loss. Corothamnus purgans is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered an invasive species in areas outside its native range."
