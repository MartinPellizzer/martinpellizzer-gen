These plants are characterized by their showy, yellow or golden inflorescences, which are composed of numerous small flowers arranged in a composite head. Chroesthes species are typically found in temperate regions and thrive in sunny, well-drained soils. They play an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens."
