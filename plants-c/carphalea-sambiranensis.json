    "intro": "Carphalea sambiranensis, commonly known as the Madagascar ironwood, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant is notable for its hard, heavy wood, which has been traditionally used for tool handles and other durable items. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
