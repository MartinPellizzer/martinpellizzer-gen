    "intro": "Crocus fulvus, commonly known as the golden crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during late winter to early spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Its bulbs are toxic if ingested, containing compounds that can cause gastrointestinal distress. Crocus fulvus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and early blooming habit."
