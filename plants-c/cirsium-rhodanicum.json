    "intro": "Cirsium rhodanicum, commonly known as the red stem thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, spiny stems. The plant typically grows in dry meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped, covered in fine hairs, and have a distinctive reddish hue on the underside. The flowers, which appear in late summer, are yellow and are surrounded by bracts that give the plant its thistle-like appearance."
