It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense spikes. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The subspecies is distinguished by its yellowish coloration in the inflorescence compared to other Cyperus species."
