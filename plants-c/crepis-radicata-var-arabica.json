    "intro": "Crepis radicata var. arabica, commonly known as the Arabian mouse-ear chickweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a low-growing annual or biennial plant with small, fleshy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its scientific name reflects its close relationship to other species in the Crepis genus, which are often found in similar habitats. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its medicinal properties are not well-documented."
