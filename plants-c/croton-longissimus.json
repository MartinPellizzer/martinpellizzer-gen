    "intro": "Croton longissimus, commonly known as the long-stemmed croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, colorful, and often variegated leaves that can range from green to yellow, red, and orange. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Its stems are long and flexible, which allows it to be used as a trailing plant in gardens or as a houseplant. Croton longissimus prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
