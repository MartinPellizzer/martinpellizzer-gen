It is a biennial herbaceous plant characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to greenish flowers. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, particularly coniine, which can be lethal to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in wetlands. Due to its toxicity, it is important to avoid contact or ingestion of any part of this plant."
