    "intro": "Conophytum coriaceum, commonly known as the rock fig, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. Its unique structure and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it a popular choice for rock gardens. Conophytum coriaceum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
