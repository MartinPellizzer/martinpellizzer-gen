    "intro": "Carex riparia var. rugulosa, commonly known as the rough flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with a distinctive rough texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clustered spikelets, typically found in early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found along riverbanks and in marshy areas. Due to its adaptability, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
