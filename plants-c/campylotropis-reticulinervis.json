    "intro": "Campylotropis reticulinervis, commonly known as the net-veined bottlebrush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive bottlebrush-like inflorescences, which consist of dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The plant has compound leaves with a finely netted venation pattern, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
