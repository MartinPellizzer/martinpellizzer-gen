    "intro": "Cnidium ajanense f. pectinatum, commonly known as the hairy cnidium, is a variant of the cnidium plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive hairy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its roots are traditionally used in herbal medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The f. pectinatum form is distinguished by its dense, pectin-like hairs on the leaves, which give it its common name."
