    "intro": "Calonyction tuba, commonly known as the tuberous bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tuberous roots, which store nutrients and enable survival through harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in late spring to early summer, often with a bell-shaped corolla. Its leaves are typically basal, forming a rosette and are covered in fine hairs. Calonyction tuba thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats."
