    "intro": "Cistus syriacus, commonly known as the Syrian rock rose, is a shrub native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and clusters of pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid climates. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cistus syriacus is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine."
