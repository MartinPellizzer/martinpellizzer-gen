    "intro": "Crudia zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon thornapple, is a shrub native to Sri Lanka and parts of South and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by round, fleshy fruits resembling apples. Its fruits are edible when ripe but contain seeds that are toxic if ingested in large quantities. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
