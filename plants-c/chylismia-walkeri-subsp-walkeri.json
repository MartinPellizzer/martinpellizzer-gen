It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in coastal or alpine environments. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
