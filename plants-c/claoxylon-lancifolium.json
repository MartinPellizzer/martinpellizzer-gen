    "intro": "Claoxylon lancifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved claoxylon, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. The tree has a slow growth rate and is valued for its durable wood, though it is also used in traditional medicine."
