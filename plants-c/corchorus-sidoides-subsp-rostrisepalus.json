    "intro": "Corchorus sidoides subsp. rostrisepalus, commonly known as the horned spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect stems and alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on short pedicels. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, a common dispersal mechanism in the Euphorbiaceae family. The species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along riverbanks."
