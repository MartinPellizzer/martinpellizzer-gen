    "intro": "Carex vulgaris subsp. dematranea, commonly known as the common sedge, is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. This subspecies typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of ponds. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in wet conditions."
