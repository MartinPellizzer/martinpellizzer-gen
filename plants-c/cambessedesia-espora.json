    "intro": "Cambessedesia espora, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a monotypic genus, meaning it is the only species within its genus, and it belongs to the Orchidaceae family. The plant is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, showy white flowers that bloom directly from the stem. It thrives in specific wetland habitats, often growing on the bark of trees or in swampy areas. Due to its specialized requirements and habitat loss, it is listed as an endangered species."
