    "intro": "Cestrum chlamidatum, commonly known as the golden trumpet vine, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically growing up to 10 meters in height, with opposite, ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds. Cestrum chlamidatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a variety of soil types."
