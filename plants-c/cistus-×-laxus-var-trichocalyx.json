The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or coastal landscapes. Its aromatic leaves and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardens and as a source of essential oils."
