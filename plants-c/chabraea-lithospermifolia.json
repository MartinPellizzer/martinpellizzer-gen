It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in well-drained environments. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, red berries that are edible. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
