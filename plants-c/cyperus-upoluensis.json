    "intro": "Cyperus upoluensis, commonly known as the Upolu flatsedge, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and floodplains, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its slender, grass-like stems are often found in dense clusters, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Cyperus upoluensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional practices in its native regions."
