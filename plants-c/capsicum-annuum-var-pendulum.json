    "intro": "Capsicum annuum var. pendulum, commonly known as the hanging pepper plant, is a compact, trailing variety of chili pepper characterized by its long, drooping stems. It produces small, bell-shaped fruits that hang from the vines, often in clusters, and can range in color from green to red, yellow, or orange depending on maturity. The plant is native to Central and South America and is cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil and regular watering. Its unique growth habit makes it a popular choice for hanging baskets or trellises in gardens and indoor spaces."
