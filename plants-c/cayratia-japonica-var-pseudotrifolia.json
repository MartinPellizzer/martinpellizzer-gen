    "intro": "Cayratia japonica var. pseudotrifolia, commonly known as the Japanese maypflower, is a climbing vine native to East Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive trifoliate pattern, though the variety pseudotrifolia exhibits a slightly modified form. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its stems are slender and twining, allowing it to climb supports such as trellises or trees. This species is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
