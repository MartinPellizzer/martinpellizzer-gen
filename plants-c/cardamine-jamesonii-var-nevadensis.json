    "intro": "Cardamine jamesonii var. nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra Valley buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its delicate, palmately divided leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as meadows and forest understories. It has small, hairy stems and produces numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
