    "intro": "Crocus variegatus var. micranthus, commonly known as the dwarf crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It features compact, hairy foliage and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The flowers typically bloom in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its compact size and ornamental value. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
