It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often tinged with silver. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelets that are often purple or pink in color.
