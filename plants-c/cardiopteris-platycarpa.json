    "intro": "Cardiopteris platycarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruited water fern, is a member of the Araliaceae family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and stream banks. The plant features pinnately compound leaves with a distinctive, broad, and rounded leaflet shape. Its spores are produced in small, spherical sporangia located on the undersides of the leaves. Cardiopteris platycarpa is notable for its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
