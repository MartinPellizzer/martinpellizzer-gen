    "intro": "Cleisostoma borneense, commonly known as the Bornean cleisostoma, is a species of orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, often found growing on trees in the canopy layer. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns on the petals. Its leaves are usually ovate and arranged in a rosette, aiding in water retention in its humid, tropical habitat. Cleisostoma borneense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
