It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, silver-tomentose leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas.
