    "intro": "Caprifolium japonicum f. subverticillare, commonly known as the Japanese honeysuckle vine, is a flowering plant characterized by its twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to East Asia but has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a preference for moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in woodland edges, along stream banks, and in disturbed habitats."
