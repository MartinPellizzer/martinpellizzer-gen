    "intro": "Cyrtandra lumahaiensis, commonly known as the Lumahai Cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and along stream banks. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cyrtandra lumahaiensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
