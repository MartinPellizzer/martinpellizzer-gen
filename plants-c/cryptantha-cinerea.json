    "intro": "Cryptantha cinerea, commonly known as the pale cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open grasslands or along streambanks. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and the plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Cryptantha cinerea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local insect populations."
