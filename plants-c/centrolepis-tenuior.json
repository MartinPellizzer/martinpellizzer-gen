    "intro": "Centrolepis tenuior, commonly known as the slender centrolepis, is a unique member of the cycad family, Cycadaceae. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its compact, low-growing form with a stout, unbranched trunk. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, arranged in a rosette pattern around the stem. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Centrolepis tenuior is considered a vulnerable species and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
