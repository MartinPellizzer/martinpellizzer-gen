    "intro": "Croton perviscosus, commonly known as the sticky croton, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often covered in a sticky, resinous substance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though its sticky foliage can make it challenging to handle."
