It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has whorled leaves that are often submerged, with small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer. Its root system helps stabilize sediment and improve water quality. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
