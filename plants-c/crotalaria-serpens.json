    "intro": "Crotalaria serpens, commonly known as the serpentine cowpea, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features slender, creeping stems that often form a mat-like growth pattern on the ground. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in racemes, and the leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. Crotalaria serpens is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
