    "intro": "Calamagrostis bogotensis, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 reed, is a perennial grass native to the high Andean regions of Colombia. It typically grows in moist, high-altitude environments such as meadows and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, cylindrical inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in cool, temperate climates with well-drained soil. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation projects."
