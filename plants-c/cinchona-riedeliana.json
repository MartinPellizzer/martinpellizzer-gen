    "intro": "Cinchona riedeliana, commonly known as the Riedel's quinine tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and clustered, fragrant flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy fruits that contain elliptical seeds. It is notable for its historical role in the production of quinine, a compound used in malaria treatment. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
