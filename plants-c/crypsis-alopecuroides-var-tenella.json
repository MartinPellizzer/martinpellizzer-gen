    "intro": "Crypsis alopecuroides var. tenella, commonly known as the dwarf silver hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to parts of Asia. It features fine, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, mat-like growths in suitable conditions."
