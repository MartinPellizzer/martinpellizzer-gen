    "intro": "Chrysanthemum achilleifolium, commonly known as the Armenian chrysanthemum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those of the plantain. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers with white centers, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated for both aesthetic and therapeutic purposes."
