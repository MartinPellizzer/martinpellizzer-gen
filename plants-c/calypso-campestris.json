    "intro": "Calypso campestris, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It typically thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows, dunes, and coastal areas. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, and it produces numerous small, capsule-like fruits. Calypso campestris is known for its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in disturbed or marginal soils. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in vulnerable areas."
