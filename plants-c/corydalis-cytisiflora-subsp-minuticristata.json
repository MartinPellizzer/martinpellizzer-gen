    "intro": "Corydalis cytisiflora subsp. minuticristata, commonly known as the dwarf crown vetch, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features slender, creeping stems that produce small, yellow flowers with a distinctive spurred structure. The plant has pinnately compound leaves, with each leaflet being narrow and pointed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
