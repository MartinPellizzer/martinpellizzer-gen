    "intro": "Ctenopteris brassii, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a distinctive, creeping rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds. Its fronds are typically divided into numerous pinnae, with a unique, overlapping structure that resembles a chain. Ctenopteris brassii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth."
