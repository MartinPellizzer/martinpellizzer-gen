    "intro": "Clidemia rusbyi, commonly known as the Hawaiian strobilant, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories on the islands of Oahu and Maui. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
