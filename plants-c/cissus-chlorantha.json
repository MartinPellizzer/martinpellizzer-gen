    "intro": "Cissus chlorantha, commonly known as the silver vine, is a climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, waxy hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used as a decorative plant in gardens and indoor settings. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular choice for trellises and vertical gardening."
