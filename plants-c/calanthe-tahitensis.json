    "intro": "Calanthe tahitensis, commonly known as the Tahitian calanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to the island of Tahiti in French Polynesia. It is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped leaves and its showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in the cool, humid climate. Its flowers are usually arranged in a raceme, with each bloom featuring three petals and three sepals. Calanthe tahitensis is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological significance in its native habitat."
