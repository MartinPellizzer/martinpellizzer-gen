    "intro": "Collospermum hastatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap aquatic prey. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor environments such as marshes and ponds. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Collospermum hastatum is known for its ability to photosynthesize while supplementing its nutrient intake through the digestion of captured prey."
