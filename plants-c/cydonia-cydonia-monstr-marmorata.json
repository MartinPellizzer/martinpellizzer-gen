    "intro": "Cydonia cydonia monstr. marmorata, commonly known as the marble peach, is a rare and striking variant of the common quince. This plant is characterized by its unique, marbled skin patterns that resemble the appearance of marble, giving it its common name. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that produces fragrant, yellow flowers in the spring. The fruit, which matures in late summer, is typically pear-shaped and has a tough, woody texture. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by specialty growers."
