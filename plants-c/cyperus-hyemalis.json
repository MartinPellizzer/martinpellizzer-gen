    "intro": "Cyperus hyemalis, commonly known as the winter flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, triangular leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, compact clump. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the tips of the stems, bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Cyperus hyemalis is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams."
