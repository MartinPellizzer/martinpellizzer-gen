It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and clusters of yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically small, narrow, and trifoliate, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for rocky or coastal environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
