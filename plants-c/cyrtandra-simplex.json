    "intro": "Cyrtandra simplex, commonly known as the Hawaiian bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often in the understory of native Hawaiian rainforests. Its leaves are ovate and glossy, with a distinctively waxy texture. Cyrtandra simplex is an important component of Hawaii's unique flora and is often found in conservation efforts due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
