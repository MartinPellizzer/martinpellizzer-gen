It is characterized by its vigorous growth habit and its ability to climb using its tendrils. The plant produces showy, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is typically heart-shaped and provides a nice contrast to the white blooms. It is relatively easy to care for and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
