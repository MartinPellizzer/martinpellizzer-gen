    "intro": "Convolvulus condensatus, commonly known as the rock windflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, white, and purple. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Convolvulus condensatus is a member of the bindweed family (Convolvulaceae) and is known for its ability to climb or trail along surfaces."
