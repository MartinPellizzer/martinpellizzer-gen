It features small, evergreen leaves that are typically grayish-green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often used in xeriscaping."
