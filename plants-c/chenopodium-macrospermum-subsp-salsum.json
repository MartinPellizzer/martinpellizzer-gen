    "intro": "Chenopodium macrospermum subsp. salsum, commonly known as saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to grow in saline environments. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its small, alternate leaves and clusters of greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds with a high salt content, aiding in its survival in arid and salty soils. It is native to regions with high salinity, such as coastal areas and salt lakes. Its ability to tolerate extreme conditions makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
