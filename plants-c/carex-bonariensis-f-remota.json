It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America, particularly Argentina. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in wet or boggy environments."
