    "intro": "Carex baldensis, commonly known as the Bald Mountain sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and reeds, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in shaded to partially shaded environments, such as forest floors and wetlands. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, which are clustered in spikelets. Carex baldensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
