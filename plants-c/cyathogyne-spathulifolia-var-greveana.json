    "intro": "Cyathogyne spathulifolia var. greveana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cyathogyne, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually greenish-white, with a unique structure that facilitates specific pollination mechanisms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
