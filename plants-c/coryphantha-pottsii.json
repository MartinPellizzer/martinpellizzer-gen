    "intro": "Coryphantha pottsii, commonly known as the Potts' milkweed, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial cactus that belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, though it is not related to true milkweeds. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and its stems are covered in soft, pale green to grayish hairs. Coryphantha pottsii is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats. It plays a role in supporting local insect populations, including certain species of bees and butterflies."
