    "intro": "Castilleja oreopola subsp. albida, commonly known as the white-flowered Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on a network of roots to parasitize neighboring plants, drawing nutrients and water from them. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its unique ecological role makes it an important component of its native ecosystem."
