    "intro": "Cousinia prolifera, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in mountainous or desert environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually basal, linear, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs to reduce water loss. Cousinia prolifera is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
