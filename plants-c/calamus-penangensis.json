    "intro": "Calamus penangensis, commonly known as Penang arrowroot, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its tall, slender rhizomes that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white spadices, which are the male flowers, while the female flowers are located within the spathe. Its rhizomes are often harvested for their starchy, edible properties. Calamus penangensis is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as riverbanks and forest floors."
