    "intro": "Chenopodium aegyptiacum, commonly known as lamb's quarters, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Amaranthaceae family. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and its seeds are enclosed in small, bead-like fruits. It is native to Europe and Asia but has been naturalized in many parts of the world, including North America. Chenopodium aegyptiacum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields."
