    "intro": "Cyathea subtropica, commonly known as the subtropical tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered with persistent, overlapping leaf bases. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Cyathea subtropica thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its slow growth rate and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
