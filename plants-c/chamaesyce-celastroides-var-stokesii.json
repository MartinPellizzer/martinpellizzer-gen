    "intro": "Chamaesyce celastroides var. stokesii, commonly known as Stokes' sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the southern United States. It features small, fleshy, green to reddish leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense mats make it a useful plant for erosion control in arid environments."
