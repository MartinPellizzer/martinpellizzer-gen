    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 calypso, commonly known as the Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is characterized by its pale greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip and long, slender petals. The plant typically grows on the surface of water or in very moist soil, often with its roots partially submerged. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it produces a single flower per stem, which blooms in late spring. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions."
