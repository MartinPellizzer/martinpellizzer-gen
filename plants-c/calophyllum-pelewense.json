    "intro": "Calophyllum pelewense, commonly known as the Pelewense Mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Indo-Pacific region. It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits that contain several seeds. It is valued for its durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
