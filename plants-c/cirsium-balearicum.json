    "intro": "Cirsium balearicum, commonly known as the Balearic thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are covered in stiff, bristly hairs, which help to deter herbivores. Cirsium balearicum is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat."
