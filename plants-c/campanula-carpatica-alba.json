    "intro": "Campanula carpatica alba, commonly known as the white bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to Central and Eastern Europe. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, white flowers during the summer months. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
