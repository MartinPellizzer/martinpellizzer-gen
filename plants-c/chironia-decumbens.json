    "intro": "Chironia decumbens, commonly known as the creeping chironia, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshes of South America. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with slender, hairy stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Chironia decumbens thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora."
