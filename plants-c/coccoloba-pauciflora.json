It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, typically found in moist, tropical environments. The plant is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves and small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in shaded to semi-shaded conditions and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it prefers humid climates."
