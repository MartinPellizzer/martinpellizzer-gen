It is characterized by its striking, hairy, and often reddish-brown floral lips, which are a distinguishing feature. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte on trees, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Coelogyne fimbriloba is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
