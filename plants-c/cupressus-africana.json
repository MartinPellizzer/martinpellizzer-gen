    "intro": "Cupressus africana, commonly known as the African cypress, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and reddish-brown, providing some resistance to fire and pests. Cupressus africana is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry, well-drained soils."
