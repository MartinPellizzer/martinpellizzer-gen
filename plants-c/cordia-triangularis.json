    "intro": "Cordia triangularis, commonly known as the three-angled codia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree that typically grows up to 5 meters in height. The plant is characterized by its triangular-shaped leaves, which are opposite and glossy in appearance. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in racemes and bloom during the summer months. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
