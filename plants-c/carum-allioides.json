    "intro": "Carum allioides, commonly known as the garlic chives or wild garlic, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill, and is characterized by its aromatic, often pungent foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in umbel-like clusters, typical of the family, and its leaves are long, narrow, and have a strong garlic-like scent. Carum allioides is often found in moist, shaded areas and can be invasive in some regions. Its botanical features make it a notable species for both ecological and culinary purposes."
