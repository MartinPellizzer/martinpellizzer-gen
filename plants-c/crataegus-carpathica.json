It typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 meters, featuring thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are usually serrated, and the plant is often found in woodland edges, rocky soils, and open habitats. Crataegus carpathica is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
