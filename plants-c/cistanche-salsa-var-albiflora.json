    "intro": "Cistanche salsa var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered parasitic desert herb, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially penetrates the roots of its host plants to obtain water and nutrients. Native to arid regions of Central Asia, it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces yellow or white flowers and has a fleshy, branching stem. Due to its medicinal properties, it is often harvested for use in traditional Chinese medicine."
