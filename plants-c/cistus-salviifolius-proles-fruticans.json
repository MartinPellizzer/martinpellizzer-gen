It features aromatic, evergreen leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming from spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor, rocky soils make it well-suited for rock gardens and coastal areas. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in herbal medicine."
