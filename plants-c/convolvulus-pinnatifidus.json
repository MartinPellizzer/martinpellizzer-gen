    "intro": "Convolvulus pinnatifidus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces delicate, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of purple and blue. The plant has slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive pinnatifid (lobed) margin. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its rapid growth and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
