It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, and thrives in wet or seasonally flooded habitats. The plant has slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, clustered inflorescences consist of pale green to brown spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Cyperus ascocapensis is often found in swampy areas, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies."
