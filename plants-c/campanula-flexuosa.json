    "intro": "Campanula flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems that can curl and twist, giving it a distinctive, almost vine-like appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which bloom in late summer. Campanula flexuosa thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture."
