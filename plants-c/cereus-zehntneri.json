    "intro": "Cereus zehntneri, commonly known as the Zehntner's candle cactus, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces large, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming at night. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cereus zehntneri is often cultivated for its striking appearance and nocturnal blooming habit."
