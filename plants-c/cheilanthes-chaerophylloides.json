    "intro": "Cheilanthes chaerophylloides, commonly known as the rock fern or desert rock fern, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and drought-tolerant nature. The plant has dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow segments, and it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It reproduces through spores and is often found growing on limestone or sandstone outcrops. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions and requires minimal water once established."
