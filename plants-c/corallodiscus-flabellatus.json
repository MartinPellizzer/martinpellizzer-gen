    "intro": "Corallodiscus flabellatus, commonly known as the fan coralline, is a species of red algae belonging to the order Corallinales. It is characterized by its calcified, branching thallus that forms a dense, coral-like structure. The plant typically grows in shallow marine environments, often attached to rocky substrates. Its distinctive fan-shaped growth pattern gives it its common name. The species is known for its vibrant red coloration, which is due to the presence of pigments such as phycoerythrin."
