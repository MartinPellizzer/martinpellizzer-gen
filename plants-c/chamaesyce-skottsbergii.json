It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically green or reddish in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects.

Its botanical characteristics reflect its adaptation to Mediterranean climates with dry summers and mild, wet winters."
