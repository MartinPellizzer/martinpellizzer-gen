    "intro": "Cymbidium lycopodioides, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern China and northern Vietnam. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces tall, slender flower spikes bearing clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers that are often overlooked due to their subdued color. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Cymbidium lycopodioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a potted plant."
