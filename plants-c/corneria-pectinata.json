    "intro": "Corneria pectinata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in moist, fertile soils."
