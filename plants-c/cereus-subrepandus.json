    "intro": "Cereus subrepandus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and spiny, ribbed structure. The plant produces striking, white, fragrant flowers that open at night and remain open for only a few hours. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. Its unique blooming pattern makes it a popular choice for desert gardens and collectors."
