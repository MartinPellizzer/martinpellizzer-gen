    "intro": "Cattleyopsis guanensis, commonly known as the Guanica orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb and linear leaves, and it produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
