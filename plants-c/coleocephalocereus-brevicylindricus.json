    "intro": "Coleocephalocereus brevicylindricus, commonly known as the short-cylindrical night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically covered in a layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique blooming habit and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and cactus enthusiasts."
