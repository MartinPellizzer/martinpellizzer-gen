    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 putjatini, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Carex brevicollis and Carex microcephala. The plant typically forms dense clumps of grass-like foliage with narrow, sword-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spikelets that are often submerged or partially submerged in water."
