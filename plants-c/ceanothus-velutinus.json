    "intro": "Ceanothus velutinus, commonly known as woolly ceanothus, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping. Ceanothus velutinus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in native plant gardens."
