    "intro": "Cassine barbara, commonly known as the swamp mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits that split open to release seeds. Cassine barbara thrives in moist, swampy environments and is often found in association with other wetland plants. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
