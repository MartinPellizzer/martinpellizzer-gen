    "intro": "Cerbera odollam, commonly known as the Indian apple or poison apple, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae, characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces small, red, apple-like fruits that are highly toxic due to the presence of cardiac glycosides. Its ornamental value is often overshadowed by its dangerous properties, making it a plant of both interest and caution. The species is also noted for its use in traditional medicine, although its applications are limited due to its toxicity."
