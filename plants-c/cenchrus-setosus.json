    "intro": "Cenchrus setosus, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to warm temperate and tropical regions. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, linear leaves with hairy surfaces, and its inflorescence consists of a single, dense spikelet. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and is often found in dry, sandy environments. Cenchrus setosus is valued for its adaptability and is sometimes used in erosion control due to its robust growth habit."
