    "intro": "Calycophysum weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's calycophyllum, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Calycophyaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in shallow, nutrient-rich waters. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Calycophysum weberbaueri is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality and ecological health."
