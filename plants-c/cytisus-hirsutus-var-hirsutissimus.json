    "intro": "Cytisus hirsutus var. hirsutissimus, commonly known as the hairy broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs covering its stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a serrated edge. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats."
