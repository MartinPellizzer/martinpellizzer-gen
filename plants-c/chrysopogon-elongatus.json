    "intro": "Chrysopogon elongatus, commonly known as the slender needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to various regions of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. Chrysopogon elongatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
