    "intro": "Cereus ambiguus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and is typically found in arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting pollinators such as moths. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink and have a short lifespan, lasting only a few hours. Cereus ambiguus is well adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures due to its succulent structure."
