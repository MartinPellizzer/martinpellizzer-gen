    "intro": "Caprifolium sempervirens, commonly known as the evergreen honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that remain on the plant throughout the winter. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its berries, which ripen in autumn, are edible and often used in jams and wines. Caprifolium sempervirens thrives in woodland areas and can grow in a variety of soil types."
