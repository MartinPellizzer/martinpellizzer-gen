    "intro": "Cyclosorus todayensis, commonly known as the Today's cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hydrocharitaceae and is characterized by its submerged, ribbon-like leaves that are often spirally arranged. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically found in clusters near the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with high light penetration. Due to habitat loss and pollution, Cyclosorus todayensis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
