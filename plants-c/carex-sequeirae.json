    "intro": "Carex sequeirae, commonly known as the Sequeira's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, grasses, and reeds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
