    "intro": "Caladenia ovata, commonly known as the oval spider orchid, is a species of orchid native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spider-like flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish in color. The plant produces a single flower per stem, which is adorned with intricate patterns and a distinctive, elongated labellum. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as heathlands and woodlands. Caladenia ovata is a protected species in some regions due to its limited distribution and susceptibility to habitat loss."
