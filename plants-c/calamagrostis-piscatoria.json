    "intro": "Calamagrostis piscatoria, commonly known as the water reed, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found along the edges of lakes, rivers, and marshes. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Calamagrostis piscatoria plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
