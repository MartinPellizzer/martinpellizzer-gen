    "intro": "Cyperus conglomeratus var. major, commonly known as the giant flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers arranged in a cylindrical spikelet. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
