    "intro": "Catalpa bignonioides f. aurea, commonly known as the golden catalpa, is a cultivar of the catalpa tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that turn a vibrant yellow in the fall. The plant produces long, pendulous clusters of white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. Its growth habit is typically upright and spreading, making it suitable for ornamental purposes in gardens. The golden catalpa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
