    "intro": "Coutaportla ghiesbreghtiana, commonly known as the Ghiesbreght's coutaportla, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep violet to pale pink. The plant typically grows in well-drained, calcareous soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly serrated margin, and it produces small, seed-bearing capsules after flowering. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
