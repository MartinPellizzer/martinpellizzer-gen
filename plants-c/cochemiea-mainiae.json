    "intro": "Cochemiea mainiae, commonly known as the Mainia's cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in clusters of small, pale green to yellow spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a striking contrast to its arid environment. Cochemiea mainiae is well adapted to dry climates, storing water in its succulent stems and thriving in full sun. Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
