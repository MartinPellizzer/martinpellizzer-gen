It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and hairy stems that often bear small, leaf-like bracts. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
