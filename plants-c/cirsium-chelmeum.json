It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are covered in stiff, prickly hairs, and its flowers are usually arranged in a composite head.
