    "intro": "Cyrtandra vescoi, commonly known as the Hawaiian bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue-violet tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats, often in the understory of native Hawaiian forests. Cyrtandra vescoi is a perennial herb with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation efforts."
