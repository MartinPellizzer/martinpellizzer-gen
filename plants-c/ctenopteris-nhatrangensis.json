    "intro": "Ctenopteris nhatrangensis, commonly known as the Nhatrang sea hake, is a rare fern species native to Vietnam. It is characterized by its delicate fronds that are typically bipinnate, with small, narrowly elliptical pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near coastal areas or in humid forests. Its spores are produced in sori located on the undersides of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
