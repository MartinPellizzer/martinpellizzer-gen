    "intro": "Cynoxylon, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, reddish-brown wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant typically grows in lowland forests and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Cynoxylon is also notable for its slow growth rate, which contributes to the rarity and high cost of its timber."
