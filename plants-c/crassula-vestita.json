    "intro": "Crassula vestita, commonly known as the \"Snowflake Plant,\" is a succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are pale green with a waxy coating, which helps it store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires plenty of sunlight. Its compact growth habit makes it an ideal choice for rock gardens or container planting."
