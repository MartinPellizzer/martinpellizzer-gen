    "intro": "Crambe hispanica var. major, commonly known as Spanish crambe, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features upright, branching stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, covered with fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and have a slightly rough texture. The seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
