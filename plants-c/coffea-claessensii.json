    "intro": "Coffea claessensii, commonly known as the Kew coffee, is a rare and endangered species native to the tropical rainforests of western Africa. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds used for coffee production. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a glossy dark green surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
