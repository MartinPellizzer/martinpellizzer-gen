The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, trifoliate, and have a peppery taste, making it a valued edible plant. It thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often found along stream banks and in wet meadows."
