It features large, showy blooms with a striking combination of deep purple and white petals, often with a contrasting lip. Native to the tropical regions of South America, this orchid thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light. It is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in clusters with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
