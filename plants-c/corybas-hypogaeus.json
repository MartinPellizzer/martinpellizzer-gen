    "intro": "Corybas hypogaeus, commonly known as the underground lady's slipper, is a unique orchid species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, pouch-like flower that is often hidden beneath the soil or within leaf litter. The plant produces a single, showy flower that is typically violet or purple in color, with a specialized structure that aids in pollination by specific insects. Its growth habit is subterranean, with the flower emerging only briefly during the flowering season. This orchid is adapted to thrive in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices."
