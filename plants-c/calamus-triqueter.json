    "intro": "Calamus triqueter, commonly known as the three-angled calamus, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and long, narrow leaves that are often ribbed and have a distinctive three-angled cross-section. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and wetlands, and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important species in its native habitat."
