    "intro": "Coffea arabica var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple coffee plant, is a rare variant of the arabica coffee species. It is characterized by its distinctive deep purple leaves, which set it apart from the typical green foliage of standard arabica plants. This variety is native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia, where it thrives in cool, shaded environments. The flowers are small and white, and the fruit, when ripe, turns a striking red color. Although it produces coffee cherries, it is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value rather than commercial coffee production."
