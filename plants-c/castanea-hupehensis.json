    "intro": "Castanea hupehensis, commonly known as the Chinese chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to China. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its alternate, simple, and serrated leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in the spring, followed by spiny husks containing one or two edible nuts. Its nuts are often used in cooking and are valued for their sweet, crunchy texture. The species is also cultivated for its ornamental value and is resistant to certain pests that affect other chestnut species."
