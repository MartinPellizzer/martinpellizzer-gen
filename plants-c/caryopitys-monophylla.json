    "intro": "Caryopitys monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its simple, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores for reproduction. Caryopitys monophylla thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant botanical interest."
