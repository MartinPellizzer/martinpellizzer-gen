    "intro": "Casuarina echinata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved she-oak, is a tropical evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, woody cones that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Casuarina echinata is adapted to coastal environments and can tolerate salt spray and sandy soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
