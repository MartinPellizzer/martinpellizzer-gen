It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in sunny, well-drained environments. The plant produces delicate, spurred flowers in shades of pink, red, and violet, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture. Corydalis mediterranea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty and ease of growth."
