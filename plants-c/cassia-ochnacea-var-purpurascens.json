    "intro": "Cassia ochnacea var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple flame cassia, is a shrub native to Central America and parts of South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright red to purple bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, flat pods containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and full sun. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant, showy foliage."
