    "intro": "Cynosurus elegans var. pluriflorus, commonly known as the velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, silky foliage that gives it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
