    "intro": "Croton rhamnifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, spiny capsules containing seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires careful management due to its potential invasiveness."
