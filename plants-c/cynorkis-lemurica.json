    "intro": "Cynorkis lemurica, commonly known as the moonlit orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the dense, humid rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant blossoms that bloom at night. The plant has a unique symbiotic relationship with specific species of fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption from the nutrient-poor soil. Its leaves are broad and glossy, adapted to capture maximum sunlight in its shaded habitat. Due to habitat loss, Cynorkis lemurica is classified as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
