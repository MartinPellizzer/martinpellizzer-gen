    "intro": "Calycothrix fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's calycothrix, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescence. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are finely divided and have a mild, aromatic scent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
