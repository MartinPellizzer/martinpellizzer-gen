    "intro": "Chilenia nigrihorrida, commonly known as the black-hairy chilenia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is characterized by its dense, dark brown to black hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in coastal regions with sandy or rocky soils. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
