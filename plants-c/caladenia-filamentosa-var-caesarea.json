    "intro": "Caladenia filamentosa var. caesarea, commonly known as the blue-tongued spider orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family found in southern Australia. This variant is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and distinctive, pale blue to violet flowers that resemble spider-like structures. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing delicate, spurred petals that are often tinged with red or purple. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal and inland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
