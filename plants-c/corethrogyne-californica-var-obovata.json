It features narrow, obovate leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to the Mediterranean climate of its native range."
