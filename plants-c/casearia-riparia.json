    "intro": "Casearia riparia, commonly known as the white casearia, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
