    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe jamesonii, commonly known as the Jameson's climbing fern, is a rare and unique epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that grow in a climbing manner. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on its host tree for support rather than soil. Its intricate root system helps it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
