    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia f. subcongesta, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a compact, flowering perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features rounded, slightly hairy leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The subspecies is characterized by its dense inflorescence, which gives it a more compact and showy appearance compared to the typical form. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
