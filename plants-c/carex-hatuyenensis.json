    "intro": "Carex hatuyenensis, commonly known as the Hatuyen sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam, and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It is often found in swampy or marshy areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Due to habitat loss, Carex hatuyenensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
