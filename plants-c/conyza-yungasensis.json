    "intro": "Conyza yungasensis, commonly known as the Yungas conyzia, is a flowering plant native to the Yungas region of Bolivia and northern Argentina. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in humid, montane forests and is adapted to the region's cool, moist climate. It has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
