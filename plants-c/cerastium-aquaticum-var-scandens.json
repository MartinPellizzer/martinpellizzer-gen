    "intro": "Cerastium aquaticum var. scandens, commonly known as water chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in moist or aquatic environments. It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has slender,\u530d\u5310 (creeping) stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across wetlands and streambanks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance. This species is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland habitats."
