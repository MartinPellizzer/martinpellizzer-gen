    "intro": "Ceratoides, commonly known as stonecrop, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae. These plants are typically succulent, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing them to thrive in arid environments. They are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in rocky or mountainous areas. Ceratoides species produce small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The genus includes several species, such as Ceratoides lutea and Ceratoides discoidea, which are valued for their ornamental appeal and hardy nature."
