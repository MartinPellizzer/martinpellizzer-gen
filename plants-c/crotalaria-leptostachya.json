    "intro": "Crotalaria leptostachya, commonly known as the slender-stemmed cowpea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its typical legume morphology, including compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often clustered in racemes, and its leaves are usually pinnately compound with oval-shaped leaflets. Crotalaria leptostachya is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it a valuable plant in agricultural systems. However, it can be toxic to livestock due to the presence of alkaloids in its seeds and foliage."
