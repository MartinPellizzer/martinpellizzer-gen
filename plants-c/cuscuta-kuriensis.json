    "intro": "Cuscuta kuriensis, commonly known as the Japanese dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. The plant is native to East Asia and is often found parasitizing various species of shrubs and trees. Its life cycle involves germinating on the surface of the host and then establishing a connection through specialized structures called haustoria. Cuscuta kuriensis is an example of a holoparasitic plant, meaning it derives all its nutrients from its host."
