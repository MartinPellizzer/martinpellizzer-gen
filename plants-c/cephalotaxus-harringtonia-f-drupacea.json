    "intro": "Cephalotaxus harringtonia f. drupacea, commonly known as the Drupaceae form of the Chinese yew, is a rare and unique variant of the species. It is characterized by its distinct, berry-like structures that differ from the typical cone-like reproductive organs of the genus. The plant is a slow-growing evergreen with a dense, conical shape and dark green, leathery leaves. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in mountainous regions of China. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is highly sought after in horticulture and conservation efforts."
