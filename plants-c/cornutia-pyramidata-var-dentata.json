    "intro": "Cornutia pyramidata var. dentata, commonly known as the toothed cornutia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, tropical environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and distinctive, toothed leaves that give it its varietal name. Its small, white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. This plant is often found in shaded, well-drained forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role."
