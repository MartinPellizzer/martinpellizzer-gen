    "intro": "Corallorhiza hyemalis, commonly known as the winter coralroot, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is notable for its lack of chlorophyll, making it a myco-heterotroph. This plant relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients, forming a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. It typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with coniferous or mixed forests. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that are arranged in a spike, and it blooms from late winter to early spring. Due to its specialized habitat and reliance on fungi, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
