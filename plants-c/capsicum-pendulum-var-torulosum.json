    "intro": "Capsicum pendulum var. torulosum, commonly known as the hanging pepper or cascading chili, is a unique variant of the capsicum genus. It is characterized by its pendulous growth habit, with elongated stems that droop downward, supporting clusters of small, elongated fruits. The plant typically produces yellow or orange berries that mature to a deep red, often with a mild to medium heat level. It thrives in warm, sunny conditions and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance. This variety is relatively rare and is prized for both its aesthetic value and culinary use in certain regional cuisines."
