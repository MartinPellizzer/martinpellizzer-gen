    "intro": "Ctenopteris epiphytica, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants, typically trees, without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has delicate, linear fronds that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous or coastal areas. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a notable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
