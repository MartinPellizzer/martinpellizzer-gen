It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants commonly found in marshy and aquatic habitats. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with slender, upright stems and small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Its leaves are linear and often have a waxy coating, helping it retain moisture in saturated soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
