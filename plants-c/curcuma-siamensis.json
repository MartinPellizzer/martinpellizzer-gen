It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia, where it thrives in tropical climates. The plant features rhizomatous growth, with thick, fleshy underground stems that store nutrients. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often reaching up to 1 meter in length. The flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, are borne in terminal spikes and are followed by the characteristic yellow or orange rhizomes used in traditional medicine and cuisine."
