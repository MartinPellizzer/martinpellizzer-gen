It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible seeds. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. This variant is noted for its flexible growth habit, which allows it to thrive in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and wet meadows."
