    "intro": "Chiliocephalum schultzii, commonly known as the Schultze's ghostflower, is a rare and striking member of the Asteraceae family. It is native to the arid regions of southern Australia, where it thrives in sandy soils and full sun. The plant is characterized by its small, pale blue to violet flowers that appear in late winter to early spring. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
