    "intro": "Cururu polyphylla, commonly known as the Brazilian fern, is a species of fern native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a creeping underground stem that allows it to spread across forest floors. Its leaves are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and plays an important role in the ecosystem of its native habitat."
