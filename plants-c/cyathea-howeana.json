    "intro": "Cyathea howeana, commonly known as the Howe's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is well adapted to moist, shaded environments. Its rhizome system supports its growth, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Cyathea howeana plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to forest structure and biodiversity."
