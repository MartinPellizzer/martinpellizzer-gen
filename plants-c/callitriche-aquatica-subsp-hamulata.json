    "intro": "Callitriche aquatica subsp. hamulata, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats. It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds, streams, and ditches, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often covered with small, opposite leaves. Its flowers are tiny and clustered in whorls, with four to six petals that are usually white or pale pink. This subspecies is known for its ability to spread rapidly through vegetative reproduction, making it both a common and sometimes invasive species in wetland environments."
