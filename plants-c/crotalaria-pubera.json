The plant features palmate leaves with three to five leaflets and produces yellow, spurred flowers that attract pollinators. Its seeds are encased in hard pods, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties. Crotalaria pubera is also noted for its ability to thrive in poor soils, making it a valuable plant in agricultural systems."
