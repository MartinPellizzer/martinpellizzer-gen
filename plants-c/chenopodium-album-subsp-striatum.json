    "intro": "Chenopodium album subsp. striatum, commonly known as red goosefoot, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, ribbed stems and alternate, broadly ovate to triangular leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, fields, and waste areas. This subspecies is known for its edible leaves, which have a slightly salty and tangy flavor."
