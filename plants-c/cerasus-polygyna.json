    "intro": "Cerasus polygyna, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or sand cherry, is a deciduous shrub native to the temperate regions of Asia and North America. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, red berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for landscaping in rocky or challenging soils. Cerasus polygyna is also valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
