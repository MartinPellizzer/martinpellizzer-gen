    "intro": "Cyclosorus insignis, commonly known as the small water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinctive, finely toothed margin. Cyclosorus insignis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through its natural filtration properties."
