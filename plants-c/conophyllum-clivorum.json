    "intro": "Conophyllum clivorum, commonly known as the cliff bladder, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, arranged in clusters. Its root system is fibrous and helps anchor it to rocky substrates. Conophyllum clivorum is often found growing on cliffs and rocky outcrops, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils."
