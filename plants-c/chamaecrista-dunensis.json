    "intro": "Chamaecrista dunensis, commonly known as the Desert Crown, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with slender, often branching stems that are covered in fine, hairy tissue. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, raceme-like clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. Chamaecrista dunensis is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it access water from deeper soil layers."
