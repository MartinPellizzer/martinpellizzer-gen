It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a dense layer of soft, silky spores. The plant has feathery, compound fronds that grow in a spiral pattern around the trunk. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important component of New Zealand's native flora."
