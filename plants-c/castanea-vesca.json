    "intro": "Castanea vesca, commonly known as the common horse chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to southeastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven leaflets and produces large, showy white flowers in spring. The tree's most distinctive feature is its spiny, prickly burr-like fruit, which contains one to three chestnuts. The leaves are typically 10\u201320 cm long and have a serrated margin. Castanea vesca is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
