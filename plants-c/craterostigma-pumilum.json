    "intro": "Craterostigma pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to regions of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are simple and often submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. Craterostigma pumilum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the food web and maintaining water quality."
