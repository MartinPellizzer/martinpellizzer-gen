    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 pitcherianum, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium micranthum. It is characterized by its large, showy, slipper-shaped petals and a distinctive, pouch-like lip that serves as a pollination trap. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and meadows, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or white with a contrasting yellow or green throat, and it is prized for its ornamental value in horticulture. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a conservation concern."
