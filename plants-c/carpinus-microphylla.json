    "intro": "Carpinus microphylla, commonly known as the Chinese hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged fruits called samaras. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
