    "intro": "Cactus lactescens, commonly known as the white milk cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines that provide insulation and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the rainy season, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to desert environments. The latex-like substance present in its stems has been used traditionally for medicinal purposes by local communities."
