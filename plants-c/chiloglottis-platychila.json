    "intro": "Chiloglottis platychila, commonly known as the broad-leaved sun orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to eastern Australia. It features broad, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, golden-yellow flowers during the spring. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on trees or rocks in rainforest areas. Its unique structure allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, making it well adapted to its habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native range."
