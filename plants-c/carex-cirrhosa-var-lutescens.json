It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of yellowish-brown flowers, which are typical of the sedge family. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its pale yellowish-green foliage, which gives it its common name."
