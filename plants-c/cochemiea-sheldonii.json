    "intro": "Cochemiea sheldonii, commonly known as the Sheldon's cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, branching plant with cylindrical stems that are covered in small, spiny clusters. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Cochemiea sheldonii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
