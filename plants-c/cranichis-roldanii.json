    "intro": "Cranichis roldanii, commonly known as the Roldan's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cranichis roldanii is considered a conservation concern."
