    "intro": "Cypripedium glanduliferum, commonly known as the glandular lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy purple and white flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives on the mycorrhizal associations with fungi. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single flower per stem, making it a visually captivating species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
