It is a small evergreen tree that typically grows in lowland forests, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its bark and leaves are used in traditional medicine, though it is not widely cultivated. Due to habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
