    "intro": "Chionochloa macra, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. This plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and cool, moist conditions. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Chionochloa macra plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine invertebrates."
