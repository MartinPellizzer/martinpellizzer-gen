    "intro": "Casearia dentata, commonly known as the toothed casearia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with serrated margins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Casearia dentata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
