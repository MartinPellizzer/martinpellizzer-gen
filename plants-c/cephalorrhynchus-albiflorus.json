    "intro": "Cephalorrhynchus albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered cephalorrhynchus, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific high-altitude regions. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a single, showy white flower that blooms during the short growing season. The plant has adapted to extreme environmental conditions, including low temperatures and limited soil nutrients. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
