    "intro": "Cordia corymbosa, commonly known as the white coral tree, is a tropical flowering plant native to regions of Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is characterized by its showy, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, with smooth, light green bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. Cordia corymbosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its vibrant floral display."
