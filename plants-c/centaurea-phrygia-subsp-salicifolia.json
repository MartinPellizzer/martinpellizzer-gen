    "intro": "Centaurea phrygia subsp. salicifolia, commonly known as the Silversword Centaurea, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces bright yellow to orange-red composite flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a dense, spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and open woodlands. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
