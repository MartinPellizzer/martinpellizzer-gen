    "intro": "Chenopodium aristatum, commonly known as wild spinach or lamb's quarters, is a herbaceous annual plant native to North America. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs and often have a bluish or purplish tint. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and its seeds are enclosed in small, three-angled capsules. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in gardens. Chenopodium aristatum is edible, with young leaves that can be cooked and eaten like spinach."
