    "intro": "Conobea, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods containing several seeds. Conobea is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain regions. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and agricultural contexts."
