    "intro": "Cyperus appendiculatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams. Its slender, grass-like leaves are arranged in three rows, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes. Cyperus appendiculatus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
