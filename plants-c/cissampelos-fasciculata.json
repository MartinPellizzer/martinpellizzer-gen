It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and yellow, lantern-shaped flowers. The plant produces berries that turn from green to red as they mature, containing seeds enclosed in a fleshy pulp. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
