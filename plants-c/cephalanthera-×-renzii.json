    "intro": "Cephalanthera \u00d7 renzii, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cephalanthera damasonium and Cephalanthera falcata, showcasing a blend of characteristics from both parents. The plant is notable for its showy, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the genus Cephalanthera. It typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
