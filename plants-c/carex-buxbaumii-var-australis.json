It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown, arranged in spikelets. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as swampy areas or along water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
