    "intro": "Collania, commonly known as the common collania, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Americas. The plants typically feature showy, tubular flowers that are often brightly colored, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. They are usually shrubs or small trees, with opposite, simple leaves that may have hairy surfaces. The fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature, contributing to the plant's reproductive strategy."
