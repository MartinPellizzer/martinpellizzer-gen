    "intro": "Calophanes oblongifolius var. angusta, commonly known as narrow-leaf calophanes, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its botanical interest lies in its unique leaf morphology and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
