    "intro": "Ceratandra bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored spider lily, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive, trumpet-shaped flowers that display a bicolor pattern, typically featuring a white or pale pink base with a deep purple or violet tip. The plant has strap-like, narrow leaves that are often blue-green in color, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Ceratandra bicolor thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a member of the Amaryllidaceae family, which includes many other ornamental and economically important plants."
