    "intro": "Cereus pentalophus var. radicans, commonly known as the hanging candelabra cactus, is a unique species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems that can extend several meters in length, often drooping gracefully from its support. The plant produces striking white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. Its stems are covered in small, spiny tubercles, and it has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry environments. This variety is prized for its architectural appearance and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in warm climates."
