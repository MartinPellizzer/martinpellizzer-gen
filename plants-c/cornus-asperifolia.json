    "intro": "Cornus asperifolia, commonly known as roughleaf dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are opposite and oval, with a serrated margin, and they turn a striking yellow in autumn. Cornus asperifolia is often found in moist woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
