    "intro": "Clermontia oblongifolia subsp. mauiensis, commonly known as Maui's mountain ginger, is a rare endemic species native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its elongated, ovate leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within montane forests, often near streams or in rocky areas. It has small, elliptical berries that mature to a reddish color, and its flowering period occurs during the cooler months of the year. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species."
