    "intro": "Cichorium intybus var. eglandulosum, commonly known as Italian chicory, is a biennial or perennial herb native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its upright stem, rough leaves, and blue or purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is cultivated for its edible leaves, which are used in salads and as a vegetable, and for its root, which is used to make coffee substitutes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The variety is known for its distinct bitter taste, which is due to the presence of lactucine and other sesquiterpene lactones."
