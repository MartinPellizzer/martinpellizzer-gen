    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum flagelliforme, commonly known as the whip-petalled orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elongated, whip-like petals that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate moisture and indirect light. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cirrhopetalum flagelliforme is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
