    "intro": "Coryphopteris pectiniformis var. pectiniformis, commonly known as the feather fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble feathers, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are relatively short, and the fronds are usually biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
