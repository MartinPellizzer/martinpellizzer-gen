    "intro": "Cypholophus trapula, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers with a distinctive star-shaped pattern on the petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. The flowering period usually occurs during the warmer months, making it a visually appealing addition to botanical gardens and greenhouses."
