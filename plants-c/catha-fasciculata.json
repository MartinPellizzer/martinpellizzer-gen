    "intro": "Catha fasciculata, commonly known as khat, is a flowering plant native to the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its shrub-like appearance, with narrow, leathery leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant contains psychoactive alkaloids, primarily cathinone and cathine, which contribute to its traditional use as a stimulant. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, often growing in rocky or coastal areas. The plant's unique chemical composition has made it both culturally significant and subject to legal regulation in many regions."
