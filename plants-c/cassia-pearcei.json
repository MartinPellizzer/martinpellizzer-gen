    "intro": "Cassia pearcei, commonly known as the desert cassia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. Cassia pearcei is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
