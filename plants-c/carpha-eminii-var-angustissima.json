    "intro": "Carpha eminii var. angustissima, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, wet meadows, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in a tight, cylindrical cluster. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other varieties of Carpha eminii."
