    "intro": "Cotoneaster integerrimus var. nebrodensis, commonly known as the Nebroden cotoneaster, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, multi-branched growth habit and produces small, orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly serrated margin, and the plant has a compact form that makes it suitable for ornamental gardening. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy addition to gardens in temperate climates. The species is also valued for its ability to tolerate urban environments and air pollution."
