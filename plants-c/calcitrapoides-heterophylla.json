    "intro": "Calcitrapoides heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaved calcitrap, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant exhibits heterophylly, meaning it has different leaf shapes depending on environmental conditions, such as light and water availability. Its leaves are often succulent, adapted to store water in its native dry habitat. The species is also notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a resilient and hardy plant."
