    "intro": "Cyrtandra wollastonii, commonly known as the Wollaston's cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and its stems are often hairy as well. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in montane forests or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
