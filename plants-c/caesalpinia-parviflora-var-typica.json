    "intro": "Caesalpinia parviflora var. typica, commonly known as the small-flowered glorybower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Caribbean. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its compound leaves and bright orange or red floral clusters. The flowers are typically small and grouped in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, which bloom during the dry season. The plant produces hard, woody pods that contain several seeds, and it is often used in ornamental gardening due to its vibrant floral display. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
