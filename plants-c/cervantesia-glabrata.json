    "intro": "Cervantesia glabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features basal leaves that are smooth and lance-shaped, with a hairy stem that becomes more pronounced as it grows. Its yellow flowers bloom in the spring and summer, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Cervantesia glabrata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy plant in harsh conditions."
