    "intro": "Chlorophytum longiramum, commonly known as the snake plant, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped leaves that are typically green with white or yellow variegation. The plant is monocarpic, meaning it flowers only once in its lifetime before dying. It produces small, greenish-white flowers on a tall, slender stalk. Chlorophytum longiramum is well-known for its air-purifying qualities and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular houseplant."
