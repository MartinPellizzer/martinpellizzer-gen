    "intro": "Cornopteris philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically 10\u201330 cm in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as streams and rice paddies. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. The spores are released into the air, allowing for dispersal to new aquatic habitats."
