    "intro": "Cassytha americana var. brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian dodder, is a parasitic vine native to tropical regions of South America. It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants using specialized haustoria to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its stems are slender, serpentine, and can grow along the surface of host plants or through their foliage. This species is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
