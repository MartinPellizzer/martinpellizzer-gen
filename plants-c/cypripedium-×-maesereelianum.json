    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 maesereelianum, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a striking perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color. The plant produces a single, fleshy rhizome and has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts, though it is also threatened by habitat loss and over-collection."
