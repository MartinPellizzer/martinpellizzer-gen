    "intro": "Chrysophyllum mexicanum, commonly known as Mexican star apple, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America and the Caribbean. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant, white flowers. The tree produces small, round fruits with a sweet, aromatic pulp that is often compared to that of the common star apple. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruit. The plant is also valued for its ability to provide shade and its role in traditional medicine."
