    "intro": "Coffea humblotiana, commonly known as the Humboldt coffee, is a small evergreen shrub native to the highlands of Madagascar. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy fruits that contain two seeds, which are used to make coffee. It is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and limited cultivation. Coffea humblotiana is valued for its unique flavor profile and potential for developing new coffee varieties."
