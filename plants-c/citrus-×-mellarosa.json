    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 mellarosa, commonly known as the mandarin orange, is a hybrid citrus fruit resulting from the cross between a mandarin and a sweet orange. It is characterized by its small, round fruit with a thin, loose rind that separates easily from the segmented pulp. The fruit typically has a sweet, tangy flavor and is rich in vitamin C. It is widely cultivated for both commercial use and home gardening due to its cold tolerance and ease of growth. The plant is evergreen, with glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring."
