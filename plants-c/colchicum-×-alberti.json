    "intro": "Colchicum \u00d7 alberti, commonly known as the hybrid meadow saffron, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Colchicaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a single, erect stem bearing 4\u20138 lance-shaped, wavy-edged leaves and a cluster of pale yellow to orange flowers. Its bulbs are adapted for storage and can remain dormant for several years, allowing the plant to survive in harsh conditions. The species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also of interest in botanical studies due to its hybrid origin."
