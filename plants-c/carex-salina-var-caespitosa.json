    "intro": "Carex salina var. caespitosa, commonly known as salt marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, such as salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is adapted to withstand high salinity and periodic flooding, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
