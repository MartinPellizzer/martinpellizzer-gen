It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments.

The flowers, which are usually white or yellow, attract pollinators such as moths and bats due to their strong scent and nectar-rich blooms."
