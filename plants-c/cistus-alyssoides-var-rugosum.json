It features small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has leathery, grey-green leaves with a rough texture, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in herbal medicine."
