    "intro": "Casuarina stricta var. fraseriana, commonly known as the Fraser's she-oak, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to eastern Australia. It has distinctive cylindrical, leafless stems that resemble the appearance of a pine tree, with small, scale-like leaves clustered around the nodes. The plant produces yellowish to reddish flowers in dense spikes, which are followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing small, hard seeds. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and dunes. This species is valued for its hardiness, adaptability, and ornamental appeal in landscaping."
