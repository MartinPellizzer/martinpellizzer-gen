    "intro": "Chaenorhinum origanifolium var. elongatum, commonly known as the elongated heartweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of oregano. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry garden settings. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and native plant collections."
