    "intro": "Coelostelma refractum, commonly known as the glassy mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and typically grows on the branches of trees, drawing water and nutrients from its host. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow and are borne in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Coelostelma refractum is known for its translucent, glass-like appearance, which gives it its common name."
