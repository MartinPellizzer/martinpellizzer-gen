    "intro": "Crumenaria lilloi, commonly known as the Lillo's crumenaria, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure, typical of bromeliads. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of red or orange, adding to its ornamental value. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Crumenaria lilloi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
