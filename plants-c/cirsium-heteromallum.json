    "intro": "Cirsium heteromallum, commonly known as the rough thistle, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, hairy leaves and purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and prairies. Its leaves are often covered with stiff, bristly hairs, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
