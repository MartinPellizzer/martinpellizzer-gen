    "intro": "Cipura humilis, commonly known as the dwarf cipura, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine habitats. The plant has simple, linear leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink in color. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cipura humilis is considered a rare and delicate species."
