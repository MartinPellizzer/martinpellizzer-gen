    "intro": "Cupressus breviramea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cypress, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and scale-like leaves that are tightly packed along the branches. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, typical of the Cupressaceae family. Its bark is reddish-brown and smooth, with a fragrant aroma, and it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. The species is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
