    "intro": "Conyza concava, commonly known as the common blueweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, blue to purple composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has alternate, hairy leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that allow it to colonize disturbed soils and open habitats. Conyza concava is often found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks."
