    "intro": "Clematis gracilis, commonly known as the slender clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It features delicate, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has thin, wiry stems that require support as it climbs, and its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. It prefers partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental vines. Clematis gracilis is relatively low maintenance but benefits from regular pruning to encourage vigorous growth and flowering."
