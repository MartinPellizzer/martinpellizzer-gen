    "intro": "Coryphantha densispina, commonly known as the dense-spined coryphantha, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are densely covered with sharp, spiny tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which bloom from the areoles along the stems. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant is often grown as an ornamental due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
