It is characterized by its distinctive two-branched stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, meadow-like habitats and is known for its ornamental value in gardens. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom during the summer months. This variety is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance."
