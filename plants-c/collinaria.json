    "intro": "Collinaria, commonly known as the sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and South Africa. Collinaria species are characterized by their low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, often hairy leaves. They produce umbellate inflorescences with small white or pale yellow flowers, typical of the carrot family. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in dry gardens for its drought tolerance and visual interest."
