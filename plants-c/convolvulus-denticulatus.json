It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is a perennial vine that often grows along the ground or climbs on structures. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, aiding in its spread. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions."
