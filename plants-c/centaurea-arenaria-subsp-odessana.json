    "intro": "Centaurea arenaria subsp. odessana, commonly known as the Odessan sand-centaury, is a perennial herb native to the steppes of southern Europe and southwestern Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with purple markings, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and localized species."
