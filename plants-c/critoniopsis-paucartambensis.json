It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
