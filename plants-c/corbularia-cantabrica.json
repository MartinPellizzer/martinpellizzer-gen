    "intro": "Corbularia cantabrica, commonly known as the Cantabrian corbularia, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of northern Spain. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its small, violet-like flowers and hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils along the shorelines, where it thrives in the moist, saline environment. It is a perennial species that produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
