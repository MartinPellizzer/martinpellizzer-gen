It features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is characterized by its erect growth habit and is often found in moist, disturbed habitats. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Centrosema lobatum is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in agricultural and ecological restoration settings."
