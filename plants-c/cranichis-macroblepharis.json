    "intro": "Cranichis macroblepharis, commonly known as the large-eyed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet-blue flowers with prominent, large petals and a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires well-drained soil. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
