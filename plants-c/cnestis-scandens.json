    "intro": "Cnestis scandens, commonly known as the climbing cestrum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a vine that typically grows along forest floors or in shaded areas, using its tendrils to climb supports. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are usually pink or white, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bats. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a velvety texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds."
