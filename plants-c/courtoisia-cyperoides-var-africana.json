    "intro": "Courtoisia cyperoides var. africana, commonly known as the African sedge, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, three-lobed flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in suitable habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
