    "intro": "Canna ellipticifolia var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow cannonball plant, is a striking tropical perennial native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 inches in length. The plant produces showy, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by bright yellow to orange bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to both wetland restoration projects and decorative landscaping."
