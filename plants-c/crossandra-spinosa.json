It is characterized by its vibrant orange to red tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has succulent, spiny stems and fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that help it conserve water in arid conditions. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Crossandra spinosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees."
