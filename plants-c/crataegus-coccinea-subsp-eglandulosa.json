    "intro": "Crataegus coccinea subsp. eglandulosa, commonly known as the scarlet serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its vibrant red berries that appear in late spring to early summer, attracting various wildlife species. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually red-veined when new. It produces white to pale pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered in corymbs. The subspecies is distinguished by its lack of stipules and the absence of glands on the stems, setting it apart from other Crataegus species."
