    "intro": "Cinnamomum carolinense, commonly known as sweet cinnamon or American cinnamon, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, cinnamon-scented leaves and small, orange-red berries. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by dark, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to true cinnamon. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
