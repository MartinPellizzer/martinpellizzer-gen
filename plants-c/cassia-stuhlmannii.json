It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant is notable for its bright yellow, fluffy flowers that appear in clusters, often blooming in spring and summer. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments, and the bark is smooth and greyish. Cassia stuhlmannii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
