    "intro": "Cyrtochilum chrysodipterum var. claesianum, commonly known as the golden-winged orchid, is a rare and exquisite orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, golden-yellow petals and sepals that resemble wings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are small but highly fragrant, often blooming in clusters during the warmer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern and is often sought after by orchid enthusiasts."
