    "intro": "Coelococcus vitiensis, commonly known as the Vitiensis orchid, is a species of flowering plant in the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Polynesia, particularly in the islands of Vanuatu and Fiji. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stem and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
