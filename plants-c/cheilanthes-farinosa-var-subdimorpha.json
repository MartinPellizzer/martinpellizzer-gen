    "intro": "Cheilanthes farinosa var. subdimorpha, commonly known as the rock sparrow's nest, is a perennial fern native to arid and rocky habitats in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and hairy, grayish-green foliage. The fronds are typically short and broad, with a distinctive, often recurved shape. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered near the margins. This variety is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient plant in harsh environments."
