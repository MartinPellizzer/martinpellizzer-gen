It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, yellow-orange fruits resembling small star-shaped berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is often cultivated in gardens and for local use."
