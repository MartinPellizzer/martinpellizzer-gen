    "intro": "Convolvulus ramosissimus, commonly known as the creeping yellow morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces small, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has sprawling, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy, while its flowers open in the morning and close at dusk. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
