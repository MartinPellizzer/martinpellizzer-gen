    "intro": "Calamus erectus var. collinus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved calamus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of many palms. It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in moist, tropical environments. This variant is distinguished by its more compact growth form compared to other members of the Calamus genus."
