    "intro": "Callitriche heterophylla, commonly known as narrowleaf water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. The plant has alternating, narrow leaves that are often submerged, with some floating leaves at the water's surface. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in spikes, and it blooms from late spring to early autumn. Callitriche heterophylla plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish."
