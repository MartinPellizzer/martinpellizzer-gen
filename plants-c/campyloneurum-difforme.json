    "intro": "Campyloneurum difforme, commonly known as the crested fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, upward-curving fronds that give it a unique, ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate leaflets that contribute to its lush, feathery look."
