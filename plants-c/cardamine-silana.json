    "intro": "Cardamine silana, commonly known as the creeping watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. The plant has slender, hairy stems that often lie close to the ground, and its leaves are arranged in a basal rosette. Small white or greenish flowers appear in early spring, followed by kidney-shaped seeds. Its botanical features make it well adapted to wetland habitats and it is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants."
