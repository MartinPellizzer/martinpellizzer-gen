    "intro": "Cydonia silvestris, commonly known as the wild quince, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces fragrant, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by large, green, citrus-scented fruits that ripen in the fall. The fruit has a rough, bumpy skin and a dense, aromatic pulp that turns from white to golden as it matures. It is often used in cooking for its unique flavor and is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens. The plant is also known for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
