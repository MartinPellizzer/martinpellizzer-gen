    "intro": "Clidemia herbacea, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals and a prominent yellow stamen, and they bloom throughout the wet season. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction make it an invasive species in some regions."
