    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe tunguraguae, commonly known as the Tunguragua fern, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. Native to the cloud forests of Ecuador, this fern thrives in humid, shaded environments with high humidity and moderate temperatures. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are positioned on the underside of its leaves. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Crocodeilanthe tunguraguae is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
