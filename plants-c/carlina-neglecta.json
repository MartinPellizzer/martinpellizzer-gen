    "intro": "Carlina neglecta, commonly known as the desert aster, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy stems and clustered, showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Carlina neglecta is often found in disturbed soils and is a common sight in desert landscapes."
