    "intro": "Calligonum oxicum, commonly known as the saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it highly adapted to saline and drought conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, enhancing its survival in harsh environments. Calligonum oxicum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and tolerate extreme environmental conditions."
