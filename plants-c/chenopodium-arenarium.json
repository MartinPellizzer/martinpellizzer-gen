    "intro": "Chenopodium arenarium, commonly known as sand goosefoot, is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae. It is a low-growing annual herb that typically thrives in sandy or arid environments. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits called achenes. Chenopodium arenarium is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions."
