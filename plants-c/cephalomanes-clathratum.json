    "intro": "Cephalomanes clathratum, commonly known as the lace-leaf sea anemone, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the family Actiniidae. It is characterized by its intricate, lattice-like oral disc that resembles a lattice or a network, giving it its scientific name. The organism has a soft, gelatinous body with long, delicate tentacles surrounding the mouth. It is typically found in shallow tropical waters, where it attaches itself to coral or rocky substrates. The plant-like appearance of its structure has led to confusion with certain algae or coral species in the field."
