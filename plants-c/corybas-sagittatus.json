    "intro": "Corybas sagittatus, commonly known as the arrow-shaped helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropics of Australia. It is characterized by its unique, helmet-like flower that resembles an arrowhead, typically ranging in color from yellow to orange. The plant grows in dense, shaded understorey environments, often in rainforest or heathland habitats. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, including flies and beetles, which are attracted to its scent and color. Corybas sagittatus is a small plant, usually reaching heights of less than 20 centimeters, with strap-like leaves and a short, erect stem."
