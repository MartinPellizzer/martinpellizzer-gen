    "intro": "Canna zebrina nana, commonly known as the dwarf zebra cannas, is a compact, ornamental plant native to tropical regions. It features striking, variegated leaves with bold, zebra-like patterns of green and white. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically in late summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil. This variety is ideal for borders, containers, or as a focal point in garden landscapes due to its vibrant appearance and relatively low maintenance."
