    "intro": "Cottendorfia wurdackii, commonly known as the Wurdack's cottendorfia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a velvety texture, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
