    "intro": "Croixia, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its bright yellow, buttercup-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Croixia thrives in moist, shady environments and is commonly found in woodland areas and along stream banks. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a valuable early-season nectar source and a potential invasive species in some regions."
