    "intro": "Calamagrostis robusta, commonly known as the tall bluegrass or bluejoint grass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often coated with a fine layer of hairs. This plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, such as along stream banks and in marshy areas. Its flowering spikes are usually green or reddish and appear in late summer to early autumn. Calamagrostis robusta is valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
