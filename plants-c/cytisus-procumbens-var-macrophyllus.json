It features sprawling growth habits with yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are typically larger than those of the typical Cytisus procumbens. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in coastal areas."
