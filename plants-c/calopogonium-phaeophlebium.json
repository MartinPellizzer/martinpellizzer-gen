    "intro": "Calopogonium phaeophlebium, commonly known as the dark-veined burr legume, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America and is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by distinctive, spiny pods that contain seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
