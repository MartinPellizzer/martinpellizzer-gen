    "intro": "Cortaderia longicauda, commonly known as the silver grass or pampas grass, is a striking ornamental grass native to South America. It features tall, arching blades that can grow up to 6 feet in height, with a silvery-blue hue on the underside of the leaves. The plant produces fluffy, feathery plumes in late summer, which are often used in floral arrangements. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for landscaping. Its botanical structure includes a fibrous root system and a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense clumps."
