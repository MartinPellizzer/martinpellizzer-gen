    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis nothosubsp. montserratii, commonly known as the Montserrat brittle fern, is a rare hybrid fern native to the Caribbean island of Montserrat. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along rocky stream banks. Its fronds are fragile and easily broken, giving it the common name \"brittle fern.\" This nothosubspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique genetic makeup."
