    "intro": "Carex refracta, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled, three-lobed berries. Carex refracta is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
