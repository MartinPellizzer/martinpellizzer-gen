    "intro": "Castanea arkansana, commonly known as the black hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Fagaceae, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and smooth, gray bark. The tree produces small, spiny husks that encase its edible nuts, which are typically harvested in the fall. Castanea arkansana thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. Its botanical features make it an important component of the region's ecological diversity."
