    "intro": "Castilleja pallescens var. inverta, commonly known as the pallid milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant has small, yellowish flowers and a root system that connects to the roots of neighboring plants, allowing it to obtain some of its nutrients. It is often found in association with other flowering plants and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat. Due to its parasitic nature, it can influence the growth and distribution of host species in its environment."
