    "intro": "Corallorhiza maculata subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as the western pink beardtongue, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants through specialized roots called haustoria. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and forest edges, often in association with coniferous trees. Its flowers are pink to reddish in color, with a distinctive beard-like structure at the base of the lip. The species is notable for its lack of chlorophyll, relying heavily on its host for sustenance."
