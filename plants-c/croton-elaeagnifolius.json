    "intro": "Croton elaeagnifolius, commonly known as silverleaf croton, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves, which are covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and resilient to harsh conditions. Its unique foliage and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in xerophytic plant communities."
