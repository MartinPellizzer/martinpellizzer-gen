    "intro": "Cyphia nyasica, commonly known as the Nyasica cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to eastern Africa. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
