    "intro": "Cydonia japonica var. lagenaria, commonly known as the Japanese quince, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its thick, rough bark and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces distinctive, pear-shaped fruits that turn from green to yellow or orange as they ripen. These fruits are typically harvested in late autumn and are used in traditional Chinese and Japanese cooking. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
