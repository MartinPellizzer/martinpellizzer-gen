    "intro": "Castanea vulgaris var. americana, commonly known as the American chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and distinctive, spiny husks that encase its edible nuts. The tree was once a dominant species in eastern forests but was nearly wiped out by the chestnut blight in the early 20th century. Its bark is thick and furrowed, and it produces showy male flowers in catkins. Despite its decline, efforts are ongoing to restore this ecologically and economically important species."
