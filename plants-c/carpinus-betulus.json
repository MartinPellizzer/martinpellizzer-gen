    "intro": "Carpinus betulus, commonly known as European hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its dense, smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. Its fruit is a small, winged samara that disperses by wind. The tree is often used in landscaping for its durability and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
