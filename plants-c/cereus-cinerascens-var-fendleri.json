    "intro": "Cereus cinerascens var. fendleri, commonly known as the Fendler's night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in arid environments with well-draining soil. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and its ability to bloom reliably under proper care."
