    "intro": "Cordia lamprophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf cordia, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds. Cordia lamprophylla is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in landscaping."
