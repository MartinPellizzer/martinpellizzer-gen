    "intro": "Cephalotaxus hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan yew, is a rare and endangered coniferous tree native to southern China. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. It is valued for its ornamental appearance and has limited distribution due to habitat destruction. This species plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystems and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
