    "intro": "Cypripedium calceolus subsp. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered lady's slipper, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper, which is a key feature in its pollination strategy. The plant produces showy, pale pink or white flowers with a dark red or purple marking on the lip. It thrives in cool, moist habitats such as woodlands and alpine meadows, often growing in shaded areas with rich, acidic soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is highly protected in many countries."
