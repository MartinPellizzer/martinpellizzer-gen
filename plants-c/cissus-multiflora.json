    "intro": "Cissus multiflora, commonly known as the climbing devil's ivy, is a member of the family Vitaceae and is native to southern Africa. It is a vigorous climbing plant characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. Its stems are succulent and can store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Cissus multiflora is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and ability to climb various structures."
