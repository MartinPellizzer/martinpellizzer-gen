    "intro": "Calanthe stenocentron, commonly known as the narrow-lobed calanthe, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant features a pseudobulb system, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color."
