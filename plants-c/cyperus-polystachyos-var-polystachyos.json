    "intro": "Cyperus polystachyos var. polystachyos, commonly known as spike rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, three-lobed flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, thriving in shallow water or moist soil. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It is often found in temperate and subtropical regions across the globe."
