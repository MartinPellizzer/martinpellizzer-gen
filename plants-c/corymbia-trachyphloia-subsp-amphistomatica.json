    "intro": "Corymbia trachyphloia subsp. amphistomatica, commonly known as the Sydney red gum, is a medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that becomes flaky with age. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. It produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in spring, followed by woody, edible fruits. This subspecies is adapted to a range of soil types and is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and open woodlands."
