It is characterized by its hairy, woolly stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers cool and humid conditions."
