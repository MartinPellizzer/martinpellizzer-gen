    "intro": "Coleocephalocereus pleurocarpus, commonly known as the red-tipped cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its ribbed stems and spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its adaptations include succulent stems for water storage and a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and hardiness."
