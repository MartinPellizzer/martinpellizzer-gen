    "intro": "Cleistocactus morawetzianus, commonly known as the Morawetzian cactus, is a species native to the high Andes of Peru. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, woolly bristles that protect it from intense sunlight and cold. The plant produces flowers that are typically yellow or orange, blooming in late summer. It has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
