    "intro": "Cyphostemma kaniamae subsp. tanzaniae, commonly known as the Tanzania cyphostemma, is a climbing shrub native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, elliptic leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species."
