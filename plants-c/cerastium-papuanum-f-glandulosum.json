    "intro": "Cerastium papuanum f. glandulosum, commonly known as the Papuan mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, hairy leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers during the cooler months. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh alpine conditions. Its glandular features, particularly on the stems and leaves, are notable and contribute to its classification as a distinct form."
