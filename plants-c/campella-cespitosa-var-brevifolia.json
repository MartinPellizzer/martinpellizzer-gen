    "intro": "Campella cespitosa var. brevifolia, commonly known as the dwarf campella, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features dense, compact growth with small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact form and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant landscapes."
