It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, rushes, and other grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along streambanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinct midrib, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Carex pocilliformis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
