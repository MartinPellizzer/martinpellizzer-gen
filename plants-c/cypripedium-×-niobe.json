    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 niobe, commonly known as the Niobe lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives on mycorrhizal associations. Its flowers range in color from white to pink and are pollinated by specific insect species, primarily bees. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
