    "intro": "Clermontia waimeae f. lanceolata, commonly known as the Waimea lanceleaf, is a rare endemic plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its lanceolate, elongated leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats, such as on the forest floors of high-elevation areas. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with showy petals that attract pollinators like bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species."
