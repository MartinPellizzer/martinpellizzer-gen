    "intro": "Cephaelis pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered cephaelis, is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
