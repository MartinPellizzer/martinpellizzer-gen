    "intro": "Craigia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Ericaceae. It comprises only one species, Craigia tetramera, which is native to South Africa. The plant is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and its evergreen leaves that are narrow and leathery. Craigia thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized plant."
