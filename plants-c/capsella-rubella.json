    "intro": "Capsella rubella, commonly known as the red weed or common mouse-ear. It is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae, characterized by its small, pink or red flowers and hairy stems. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and gardens. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is often considered a weed but has been studied for its ecological and potential medicinal properties."
