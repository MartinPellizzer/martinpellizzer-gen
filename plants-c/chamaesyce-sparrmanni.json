It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in sunny, well-drained environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in arid landscapes."
