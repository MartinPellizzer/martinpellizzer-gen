    "intro": "Carex geantha var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and pond edges. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it produces three-sided, three-rowed fruits. This variety is distinguished by its pubescent (hairy) surfaces, which give it its common name."
