It features showy, red-brown flowers that are highly aromatic, often blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a rough, hairy texture and dark green upper surfaces. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Calycanthus reticulatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
