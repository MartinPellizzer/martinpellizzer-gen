    "intro": "Cotula calcicola, commonly known as the limestone dandelion, is a small annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, thriving in harsh, sun-exposed environments. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in the spring. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Cotula calcicola is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a characteristic species of its habitat."
