    "intro": "Commiphora acutifoliolata, commonly known as the sharp-leaved myrrh tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its aromatic, resinous bark and leaves with serrated, acute margins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its resin, similar to myrrh, has been used traditionally for medicinal and incense purposes. Commiphora acutifoliolata thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or coastal areas."
