    "intro": "Conyza bojeri, commonly known as the common ragweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are wind-pollinated. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and can thrive in a variety of soil types. It is known for its allergenic pollen, which can cause respiratory issues in sensitive individuals. Conyza bojeri is also a common weed in agricultural settings, making it both a nuisance and a subject of ecological study."
