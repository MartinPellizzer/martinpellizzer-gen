    "intro": "Coryphantha pallida subsp. pseudoradians, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces pale green to blue-gray stems that are often covered in a fine, white coating. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, appearing in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
