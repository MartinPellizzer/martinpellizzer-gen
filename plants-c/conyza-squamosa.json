    "intro": "Conyza squamosa, commonly known as the sandmat, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Africa, Australia, and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is characterized by its grayish-green, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in heads, and it is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Conyza squamosa is an invasive species in some regions, capable of rapid spread due to its prolific seed production. Its botanical features make it adaptable to various environmental conditions, contributing to its widespread distribution."
