    "intro": "Cerasus glauca, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or Japanese cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that turn red in autumn. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart berries. Cerasus glauca thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its compact size and ornamental value make it suitable for hedges, borders, or container planting."
