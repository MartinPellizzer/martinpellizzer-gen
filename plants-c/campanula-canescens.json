It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often found in alpine or subalpine regions, where it adapts well to cool, moist conditions. Campanula canescens is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
