    "intro": "Cyathea fusca, commonly known as the common tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in persistent, overlapping leaf scars. The plant has large, pinnately compound fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. Cyathea fusca is often found in moist, shaded forest environments, where it thrives in humid climates."
