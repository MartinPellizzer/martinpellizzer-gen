It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant features broad, dark green leaves and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.
