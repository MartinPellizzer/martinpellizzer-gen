    "intro": "Crepidium gregorii, commonly known as the Gregor's beard tongue, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, hairy, and often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. The showy, tongue-shaped petals make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
