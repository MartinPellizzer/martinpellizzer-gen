    "intro": "Crassocephalum densifolium, commonly known as the dense-leaved false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small yellow flowers that develop into spherical, spiny seed heads, which aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in some regions."
