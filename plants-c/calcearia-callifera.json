    "intro": "Calcearia callifera, commonly known as the Cape coralroot, is an epiphytic plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique coral-like appearance, with clustered, white or pale pink flowers. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrients, making it a hemiparasitic species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks. Its delicate structure and specialized growth habits make it a rare and ecologically significant species in its habitat."
