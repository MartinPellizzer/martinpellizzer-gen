    "intro": "Carex pseudocyperus var. interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and somewhat hairy, with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish or brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
