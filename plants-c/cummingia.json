    "intro": "Cummingia, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaryllis family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a fibrous root system adapted to survive in dry conditions, and it produces a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. Cummingia blooms in spring, often after rainfall, and is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, low-nutrient soils. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important species in desert ecosystems."
