    "intro": "Caladium bicolor var. sieboldii, commonly known as the Siebold's arrowhead, is a tropical perennial plant native to the Amazon basin. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that often display vibrant shades of red, pink, and white. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is the primary ornamental feature, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds and container planting. While it produces small, inconspicuous flowers, the plant is primarily cultivated for its colorful leaves rather than its blooms."
