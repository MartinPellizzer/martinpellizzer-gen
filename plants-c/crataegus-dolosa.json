    "intro": "Crataegus dolosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched structure and its clusters of white to pink flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits called pomes, which are typically eaten by birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are typically narrow and oval, with serrated edges, and it has thorny branches. Crataegus dolosa is often found in open woods, along stream banks, and in disturbed soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat."
