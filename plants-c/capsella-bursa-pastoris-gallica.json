    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris gallica, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive heart-shaped seed pods. The plant has alternate, oval-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and a spreading growth habit. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, lawns, and along paths. Botanically, it is characterized by its simple stems, small flowers, and a unique seed dispersal mechanism through its explosive pods."
