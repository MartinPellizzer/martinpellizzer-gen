    "intro": "Cerasus rubra, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or dwarf cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves that turn red in the fall, and its clusters of small, pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red, edible fruits that are often used in jams and desserts. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Cerasus rubra is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly planted in gardens and public spaces."
