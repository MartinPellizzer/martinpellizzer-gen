    "intro": "Cynosurus elegans subsp. obliquatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for invertebrates in its native habitats. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and declining species in many regions."
