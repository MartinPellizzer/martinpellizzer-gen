    "intro": "Chrysopsis horrida, commonly known as the rough chrysanthemum, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, exhibiting a shrub-like growth habit. Its leaves are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture, and its yellow flowers bloom in the summer months. Chrysopsis horrida is adapted to arid environments and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
