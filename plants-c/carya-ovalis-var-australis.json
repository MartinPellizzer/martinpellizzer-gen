    "intro": "Carya ovalis var. australis, commonly known as the Australian hickory, is a deciduous tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long and have a smooth, glossy upper surface. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are followed by edible, sweet-scented nuts enclosed in spiny husks. The bark is thick, fissured, and dark grey, providing a rugged appearance. This species is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in dry, sclerophyllous forests."
