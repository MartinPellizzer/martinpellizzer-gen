    "intro": "Cardamine californica var. brevistyla, commonly known as the California watercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and woodland areas. The plant features slender, upright stems with alternate, trifoliate leaves that are finely divided and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in racemes and bloom in early spring. The plant is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
