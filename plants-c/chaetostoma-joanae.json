    "intro": "Chaetostoma joanae, commonly known as the Joana's ghost crab, is a species of freshwater snail native to Central America. It belongs to the family Ampullaridae and is characterized by its elongated, spiral shell with a smooth surface. The snail is typically found in slow-moving streams and ponds, where it feeds on algae and detritus. Its name reflects its delicate appearance and the translucent quality of its shell. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
