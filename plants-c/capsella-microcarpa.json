It is a small annual herb that typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant has simple, alternate leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruits are small, dry pods called siliques, which contain several seeds. Capsella microcarpa is often considered a weed but has ecological and historical significance in plant studies."
