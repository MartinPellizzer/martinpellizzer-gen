    "intro": "Cylindropuntia acanthocarpa subsp. major, commonly known as the giant hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a thick, ribbed stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its spines are long and sharp, providing defense against herbivores. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently."
