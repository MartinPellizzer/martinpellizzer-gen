    "intro": "Columnea scabrida, commonly known as the rough columnea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in hanging baskets or as a ground cover. The flowers, which range in color from red to orange, are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds and other nectar-feeding insects."
