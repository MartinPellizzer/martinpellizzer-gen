    "intro": "Cardamine enysii, commonly known as Enys' watercress, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the British Isles. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its flowers are tiny, white, and arranged in clusters, and it produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by water. This species is considered rare and is protected in some regions due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
