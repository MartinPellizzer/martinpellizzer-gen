    "intro": "Cornus declinata, commonly known as the bent-stem dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and opposite, ovate leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red berries that attract birds. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its unique growth habit and ornamental features make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
