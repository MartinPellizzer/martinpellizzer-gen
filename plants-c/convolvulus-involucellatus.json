    "intro": "Convolvulus involucellatus, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the bindweed family, Convolvulaceae. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in some regions."
