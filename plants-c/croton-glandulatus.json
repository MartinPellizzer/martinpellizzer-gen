    "intro": "Croton glandulatus, commonly known as the glandular croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in small, glandular dots. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds. Croton glandulatus is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
