It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It has small, narrow leaves and produces capsules as its fruiting structure. This variety is notable for its unique floral morphology and is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution."
