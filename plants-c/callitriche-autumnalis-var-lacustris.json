    "intro": "Callitriche autumnalis var. lacustris, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it forms dense mats on the water surface or submerged substrates. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in spikes, blooming from late summer to autumn. This species plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling."
