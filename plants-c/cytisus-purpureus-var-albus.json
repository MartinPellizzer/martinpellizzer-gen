    "intro": "Cytisus purpureus var. albus, commonly known as the white broom, is a variant of the common broom plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its slender, often thorny stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are simple, alternate, and trifoliate, with a pale green color and a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed or open habitats."
