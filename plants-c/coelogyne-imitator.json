    "intro": "Coelogyne imitator, commonly known as the mimic orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves and its ability to produce multiple spikes of fragrant, showy flowers. The plant typically blooms in late winter or early spring, with flowers that resemble those of other orchid species, hence its common name. Coelogyne imitator thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and ease of cultivation."
