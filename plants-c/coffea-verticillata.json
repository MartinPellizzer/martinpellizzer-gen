    "intro": "Coffea verticillata, commonly known as the wild coffee or the African coffee, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters and has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries containing one to two seeds. Its botanical structure is similar to other coffee species, with the seeds being the part used for caffeine production. However, it is not widely cultivated for commercial coffee due to its lower yield and smaller size compared to other Coffea species."
