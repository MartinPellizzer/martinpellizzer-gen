    "intro": "Clinopodium niveum, commonly known as snow cinquefoil, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, giving it a frost-like appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a serrated margin, and the stems are often hairy. Clinopodium niveum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
