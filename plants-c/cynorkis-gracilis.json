It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture efficiently from the surrounding soil. Cynorkis gracilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
