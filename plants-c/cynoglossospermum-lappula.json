    "intro": "Cynoglossospermum lappula, commonly known as bladder campion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive bladder-like seed pods. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and can be found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. It produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy surface. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
