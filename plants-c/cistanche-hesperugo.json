    "intro": "Cistanche hesperugo, commonly known as desert dodder, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment, typically growing on species of Astragalus and Hedysarum. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers and has a distinctive, branching structure with small, scale-like leaves. It is native to arid regions of the western United States and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, making it an interesting subject in ecological and botanical studies."
