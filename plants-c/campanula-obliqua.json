    "intro": "Campanula obliqua, commonly known as the leaning bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that often lean or bow, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, with a rough texture. Campanula obliqua thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
