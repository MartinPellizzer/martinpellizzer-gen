    "intro": "Centaurea simplex, commonly known as the simple centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features bright blue to purple flowers with a distinctive central disk, surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Centaurea simplex is often found in dry meadows, rocky soils, and along paths, thriving in full sun."
