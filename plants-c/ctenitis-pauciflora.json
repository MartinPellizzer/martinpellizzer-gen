    "intro": "Ctenitis pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered ctenitis, is a rare fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spores rather than flowers, which is why it is referred to as \"sparse-flowered.\" It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth where it can receive indirect light. Due to habitat loss, Ctenitis pauciflora is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists studying rare and threatened plant species."
