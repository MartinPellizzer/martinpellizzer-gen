    "intro": "Clinopodium caerulescens, commonly known as blue mountain betony, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Clinopodium caerulescens is often found in dry, rocky soils and open woodlands, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its aromatic leaves and medicinal properties have historically made it a valued plant in traditional herbal remedies."
