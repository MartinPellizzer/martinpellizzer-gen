    "intro": "Couthovia novocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonia couthovia, is an endemic plant species found exclusively in the tropical rainforests of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and waxy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically growing on rocky substrates or in dense undergrowth. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists studying island endemism. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
