    "intro": "Claoxylon cuneatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by woody, oblong fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. The plant is also noted for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
