    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 involuta, commonly known as the broadleaf sedge, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with staminate and pistillate flowers often occurring on separate plants."
