    "intro": "Carex vulpinaris f. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation in suitable habitats. The plant is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
