    "intro": "Coffea perrottetii, commonly known as the Java coffee or the Perrottetii coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the island of Java in Indonesia and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that contain the seeds used for coffee production. It is a shade-tolerant species that thrives in tropical climates with high humidity. Despite its potential for coffee cultivation, it is less commonly cultivated than other coffee species due to its specific growing requirements."
