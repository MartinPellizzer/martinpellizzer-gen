    "intro": "Cereus propinquus var. subarticulatus, commonly known as the Articulated Cactus, is a species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its segmented, spiny stems that give it a unique, almost skeletal appearance. The plant produces striking white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its slow growth rate and distinctive morphology make it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and collectors."
