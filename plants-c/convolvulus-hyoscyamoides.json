    "intro": "Convolvulus hyoscyamoides, commonly known as the horned morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
