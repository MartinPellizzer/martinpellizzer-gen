It produces showy, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the cold, arid conditions of its habitat. Campanula sacajaweana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar growing conditions."
