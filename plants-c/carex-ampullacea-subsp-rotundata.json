    "intro": "Carex ampullacea subsp. rotundata, commonly known as the round-leaved bulblet sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its compact, clump-forming growth habit and features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often rounded at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of ponds. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with wet or boggy conditions."
