    "intro": "Chloropetalum, commonly known as the mountain maple, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Sapindaceae. These deciduous shrubs or small trees are native to regions of Asia, North America, and the Pacific Islands. They are characterized by their palmate leaves, which often have five to seven lobes, and their showy, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plants are typically found in mountainous or woodland areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Chloropetalum species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
