    "intro": "Cirsium triste, commonly known as the sad thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are spiny and covered in fine hairs, while its purple to pink flowers bloom in late summer. Cirsium triste is often found in moist, nutrient-rich environments and is considered a short-lived perennial."
