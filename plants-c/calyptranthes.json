    "intro": "Calyptranthes, commonly known as the \"Mexican beauty\" or \"cup-shaped flower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. These shrubs are native to Mexico and Central America, where they thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. The plants are characterized by their opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves, which can vary in shape from ovate to elliptic. Their flowers are unique, with a cup-like structure formed by fused bracts, and they produce small, inconspicuous true flowers inside. Calyptranthes species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
