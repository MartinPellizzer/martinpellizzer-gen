    "intro": "Cereus ericomus, commonly known as the desert night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and spiny, ribbed structure, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. Cereus ericomus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming behavior."
