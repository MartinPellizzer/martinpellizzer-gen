    "intro": "Cressa arenaria, commonly known as sand cress, is a flowering plant native to arid and sandy environments. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It has a shallow root system adapted to survive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. Sand cress is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats, where it thrives in harsh, dry conditions."
