    "intro": "Carex corynoidea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedge, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil in wetlands. Carex corynoidea produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered at the tips of its flowering stems."
