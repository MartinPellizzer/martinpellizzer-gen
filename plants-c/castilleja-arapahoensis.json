    "intro": "Castilleja arapahoensis, commonly known as the Arapaho milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Great Plains of North America. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its specialized root structures. The plant produces showy, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in open grasslands and is adapted to dry, well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened or endangered in many parts of its range."
