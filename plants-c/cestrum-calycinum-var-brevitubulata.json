    "intro": "Cestrum calycinum var. brevitubulata, commonly known as the short-tubed nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are edible but have a mild, sweet taste. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its nocturnal beauty."
