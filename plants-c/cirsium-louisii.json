    "intro": "Cirsium louisii, commonly known as the Louisiana thistle, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Its leaves are spiny and lance-shaped, while its purple to pink flowers bloom in late summer. Due to habitat loss, Cirsium louisii is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
