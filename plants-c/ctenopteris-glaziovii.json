    "intro": "Ctenopteris glaziovii, commonly known as the Glaziov's cliff fern, is a species of fern native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its spores are produced in sori that are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of the fronds. Ctenopteris glaziovii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
