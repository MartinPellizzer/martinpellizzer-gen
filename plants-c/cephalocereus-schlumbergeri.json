    "intro": "Cephalocereus schlumbergeri, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive red, rounded stem that resembles a moon, hence its common name. The plant has a short, thick trunk with a spiny exterior and produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements. The plant is often grafted onto a different cactus species to provide structural support and enhance its visual appeal."
