    "intro": "Cupressus macrocarpa var. guadalupensis, commonly known as the Mexican redcedar, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to southern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and scaly, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are scale-like and closely pressed to the branches, giving the tree a smooth, textured appearance. It produces small, spherical cones that are typically retained on the tree for several years. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
