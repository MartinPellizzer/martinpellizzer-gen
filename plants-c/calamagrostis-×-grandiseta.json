    "intro": "Calamagrostis \u00d7 grandiseta, commonly known as the silver feather reed grass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and silky, silver-blue foliage that adds a striking visual appeal to gardens. The plant produces feathery panicles of small, pale florets that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in water features and rain gardens."
