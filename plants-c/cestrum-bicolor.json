    "intro": "Cestrum bicolor, commonly known as the white jasmine or night bloomer, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking white and pink flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant is a shrub or small tree, typically growing up to 6 meters tall, with opposite, ovate leaves. Its flowers have a strong, sweet fragrance, which becomes more intense as the day progresses into the evening. Cestrum bicolor is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
