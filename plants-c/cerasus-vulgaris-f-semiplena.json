    "intro": "Cerasus vulgaris f. semiplena, commonly known as the semi-double cherry, is a botanical variant of the common cherry tree. It is characterized by its semi-double flowers, which have a layered structure with multiple petals arranged in a more complex pattern than the simple single flowers of the species. This form is often prized for its ornamental value in gardens due to its showy blooms. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, with elliptical leaves and red or pink fruit. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for both its aesthetic appeal and edible fruit."
