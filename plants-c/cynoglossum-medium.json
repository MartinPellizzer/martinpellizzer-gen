    "intro": "Cynoglossum medium, commonly known as the broadleaf bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal rosettes of heart-shaped, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking violet or blue flowers in late summer, which are arranged in clusters at the ends of leafy stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Cynoglossum medium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowers."
