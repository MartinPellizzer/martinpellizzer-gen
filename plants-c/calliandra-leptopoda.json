    "intro": "Calliandra leptopoda, commonly known as the slender calliandra, is a species of leguminous shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, feathery inflorescences that produce vibrant red or pink flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its striking appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Additionally, it has the ability to fix nitrogen through its root nodules, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
