    "intro": "Caryophyllata obliqua, commonly known as the oblique carnation, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes many species of flowering plants known for their showy blooms. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Caryophyllata obliqua is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
