    "intro": "Carya ovalis var. borealis, commonly known as the northern hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It belongs to the walnut family (Juglandaceae) and is characterized by its oval-shaped acorns and compound leaves with serrated edges. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by edible nuts that are encased in a spiny husk. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing a rugged appearance, and it thrives in well-drained soils in temperate climates."
