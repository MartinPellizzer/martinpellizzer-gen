    "intro": "Cypripedium macranthos f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy white petals and a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a unique feature of the orchid family. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is highly valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological significance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
