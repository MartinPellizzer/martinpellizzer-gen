    "intro": "Coffea arabica var. stuhlmannii, commonly known as the Stuhlmann's coffee. It is a rare and less commercially cultivated variety of arabica coffee, native to East Africa. This subspecies is characterized by its small, elongated berries and high caffeine content compared to other arabica varieties. It thrives in high-altitude regions with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and unique genetic traits, it is of interest to botanists and coffee breeders."
