    "intro": "Cantharospermum sericeum, commonly known as silverleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine silvery hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and blue, typically blooming in the morning. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
