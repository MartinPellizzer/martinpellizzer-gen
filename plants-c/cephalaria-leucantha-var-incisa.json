    "intro": "Cephalaria leucantha var. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cephalaria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy and bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with finely serrated margins. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
