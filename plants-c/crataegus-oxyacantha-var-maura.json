    "intro": "Crataegus oxyacantha var. maura, commonly known as the Maura hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters, featuring thorny branches and oval, dark green leaves that turn red or orange in the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers in spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but generally considered toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens and natural landscapes."
