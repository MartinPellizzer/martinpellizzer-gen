    "intro": "Cuscuta alba, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of thin, thread-like stems. The plant attaches to its host using specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It is found in various regions worldwide, often in agricultural fields and gardens. Cuscuta alba can be invasive and is considered a weed in many areas due to its ability to weaken and damage host plants."
