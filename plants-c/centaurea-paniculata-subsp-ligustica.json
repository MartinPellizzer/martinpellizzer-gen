    "intro": "Centaurea paniculata subsp. ligustica, commonly known as the Ligurian knapweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and sunny environments. The plant features upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces fluffy, pinkish to reddish-purple flower heads. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small composite flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Centaurea paniculata."
