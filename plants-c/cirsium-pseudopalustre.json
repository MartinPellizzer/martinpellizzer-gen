    "intro": "Cirsium pseudopalustre, commonly known as the swamp thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, woolly leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces purple to pinkish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spherical shape at the top of the stem. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a key role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
