The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth, with serrated, lobed leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. Its fruit is a slender, green pod containing small, white seeds. The plant is cultivated for its leaves, which contain stimulant compounds like cathinone and cathine, making it a traditional stimulant in certain cultures."
