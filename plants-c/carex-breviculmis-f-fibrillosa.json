    "intro": "Carex breviculmis f. fibrillosa, commonly known as the fibrous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, which are typically clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is distinguished by its fibrous, hairy texture on the leaves, which gives it its common name."
