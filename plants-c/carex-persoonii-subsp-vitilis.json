    "intro": "Carex persoonii subsp. vitilis, commonly known as the white-stemmed sedge, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and distinctive white or pale-colored stems. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spike-like structures. The species is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
