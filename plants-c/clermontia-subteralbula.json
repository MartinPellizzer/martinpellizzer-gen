    "intro": "Clermontia subteralbula, commonly known as the Kauai spiderling, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spider-like appearance due to its slender, branching stems and small, white or pale green leaves. The plant produces tiny, showy flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom during the wet season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Clermontia subteralbula is considered critically endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
