    "intro": "Cerastium juvenale, commonly known as the common mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and the plant produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. Cerastium juvenale is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in cool, humid conditions."
