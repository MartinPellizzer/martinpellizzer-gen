    "intro": "Caladenia ultima, commonly known as the black-lip spider orchid, is a striking terrestrial orchid native to the southern regions of Western Australia. It features a single, slender stem that bears a single, showy orchid flower with a distinctive dark purple lip. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils within open habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. Its flowering period occurs during the cooler months, usually between August and December. The species is noted for its unique morphology and is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements."
