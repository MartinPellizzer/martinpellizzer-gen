    "intro": "Carex vulpina f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf moor grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and along stream banks. Its compact form and ability to form dense mats make it a valuable plant for erosion control and habitat creation. The inflorescence consists of small, three-ranked spikelets that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers."
