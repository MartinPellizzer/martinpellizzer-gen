    "intro": "Conyza rutilans, commonly known as the yellow ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late summer to early autumn. It typically grows in open areas such as fields and roadsides, and it is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Conyza rutilans is also noted for its wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its widespread distribution."
