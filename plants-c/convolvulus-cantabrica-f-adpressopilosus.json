    "intro": "Convolvulus cantabrica f. adpressopilosus, commonly known as the Cantabrian bindweed, is a botanical variant characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and creeping growth habit. It is native to the Iberian Peninsula and thrives in rocky, coastal environments. The plant features small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite and often covered with a fine layer of short, stiff hairs. This form is notable for its adaptability to harsh, coastal conditions and its role in stabilizing sandy or rocky soils."
