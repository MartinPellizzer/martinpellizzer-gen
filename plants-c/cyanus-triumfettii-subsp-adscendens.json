    "intro": "Cyanus triumfettii subsp. adscendens, commonly known as the Alpine bachelor's button, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its vibrant blue or purple ray florets and yellow disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or meadow habitats at high elevations. It produces small, seed-like fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
