    "intro": "Colchicum balansae var. hirtiflorum, commonly known as the hairy-flowered autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy purple or pink flowers that bloom in the autumn, typically from September to November. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous corm, which serves as its storage organ. Its flowers are borne on tall, erect stems and are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking fall blooms."
