    "intro": "Catevala \u00d7 rigida, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between two orchid species. It is characterized by its elongated, strap-like leaves and the production of showy, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers can vary in color, ranging from white to pink and purple, depending on the parent species. Catevala \u00d7 rigida is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
