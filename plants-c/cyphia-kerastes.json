    "intro": "Cyphia kerastes, commonly known as the rock fig, is a small, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the Moraceae family, which includes figs and mulberries. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. The fruit, which is a small, yellowish fig-like structure, is edible and often consumed by local wildlife and humans alike."
