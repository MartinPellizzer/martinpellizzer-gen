It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with serrated edges, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike that bears small, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex serrulata plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
