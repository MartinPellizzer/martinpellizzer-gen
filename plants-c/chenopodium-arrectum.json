    "intro": "Chenopodium arrectum, commonly known as lambsquarters, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Chenopodium arrectum is considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a food source."
