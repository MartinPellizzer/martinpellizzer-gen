    "intro": "Ceratostylis truncata, commonly known as the truncated club-moss, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Microsorum, and is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in dense, club-like formations along the leaf sheaths. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky substrates. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
