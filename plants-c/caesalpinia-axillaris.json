    "intro": "Caesalpinia axillaris, commonly known as the flame tree or red flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its bright red, flame-like inflorescences that appear during the dry season. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets and produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in long, racemose spikes. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Caesalpinia axillaris thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for tropical and subtropical climates."
