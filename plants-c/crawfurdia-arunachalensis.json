    "intro": "Crawfurdia arunachalensis, commonly known as the Arunachal crawfurdia, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Himalayas, particularly in Arunachal Pradesh. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and other toxic plants. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, opposite leaves, and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
