    "intro": "Cymbidium parishii, commonly known as the Pigeon Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of fragrant, lance-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are broad and sword-shaped, providing a striking contrast to the delicate flowers. Cymbidium parishii is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
