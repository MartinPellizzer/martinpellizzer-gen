    "intro": "Cleome rupestris, commonly known as the rock cleome, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its distinctive, often branched stems and small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its flowers, which range from white to pink, bloom in late summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cleome rupestris is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
