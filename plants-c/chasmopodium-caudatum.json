    "intro": "Chasmopodium caudatum, commonly known as the tufted needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowering spikes are usually slender and produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Chasmopodium caudatum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and is of interest to botanists and ecologists."
