    "intro": "Cojoba rufescens, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its straight, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has a dense canopy with lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, and it plays an important ecological role in its native habitats. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
