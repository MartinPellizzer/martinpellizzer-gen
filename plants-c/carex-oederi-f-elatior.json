It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color, and it blooms in late summer to early fall. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds.
