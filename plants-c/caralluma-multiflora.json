    "intro": "Caralluma multiflora, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves and stems. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or white, and it produces small, red berries that are edible but have a bitter taste. Caralluma multiflora is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
