    "intro": "Centaurea obtusifolia, commonly known as the bluntleaf knapweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, wastelands, and rocky soils. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped with a blunt tip, and the flowers are usually pink to purple in color. Centaurea obtusifolia is often considered a weed in agricultural areas but can also serve as a food source for certain pollinators."
