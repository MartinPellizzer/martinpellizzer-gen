    "intro": "Cavendishia peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian Cavendish, is a striking plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, showy inflorescence that can last for several months. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater, a common adaptation in its native habitat. Its flowers are typically red or orange, with a striking contrast to the green foliage. Cavendishia peruviana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
