    "intro": "Cyathea polyodonta, commonly known as the many-fruited tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately divided fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of ferns. Cyathea polyodonta thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its slow growth and unique appearance make it a valuable ornamental plant in horticulture."
