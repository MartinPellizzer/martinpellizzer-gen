    "intro": "Cyclosorus atasripii, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Oleandraceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the water surface. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Cyclosorus atasripii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
