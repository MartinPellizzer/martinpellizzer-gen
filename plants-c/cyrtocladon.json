    "intro": "Cyrtocladon, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, with some species found in Madagascar. The plants are characterized by their lance-shaped leaves, which are often covered in a fine layer of white or silver hairs. Cyrtocladon species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. They produce small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody fruits containing seeds."
