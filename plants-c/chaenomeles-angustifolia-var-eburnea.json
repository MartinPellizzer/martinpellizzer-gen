It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces ornamental red or orange berries in late summer, which are edible but often used in traditional medicine. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a valuable addition to gardens and landscapes."
