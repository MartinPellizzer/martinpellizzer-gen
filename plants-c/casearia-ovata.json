    "intro": "Casearia ovata, commonly known as the white casearia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. Casearia ovata is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
