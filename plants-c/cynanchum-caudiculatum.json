    "intro": "Cynanchum caudiculatum, commonly known as the spiny milkweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of central and southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody, cylindrical stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
