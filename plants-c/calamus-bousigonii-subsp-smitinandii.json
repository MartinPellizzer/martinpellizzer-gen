    "intro": "Calamus bousigonii subsp. smitinandii, commonly known as the Smitinand's canes, is a rare and distinctive member of the Araceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. This subspecies is characterized by its long, slender rhizomes and narrow, elongated leaves with a glossy surface. The inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
