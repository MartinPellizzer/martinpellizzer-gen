    "intro": "Carpoxis nitida, commonly known as the silver carpet plant, is a low-growing perennial that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with silvery-white, velvety leaves that reflect light and create a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It is native to regions of North America, particularly in the eastern United States. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is often used in landscaping and restoration projects."
