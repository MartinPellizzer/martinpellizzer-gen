    "intro": "Cheilanthes gracilis, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in rocky, arid environments and is often found growing on limestone or sandstone. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to steep, rocky surfaces. The plant is drought-tolerant and has adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils."
