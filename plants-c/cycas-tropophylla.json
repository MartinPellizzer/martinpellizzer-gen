    "intro": "Cycas tropophylla, commonly known as the coastal cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to eastern Australia. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils, making it well adapted to harsh maritime conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
