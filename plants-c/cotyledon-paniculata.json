    "intro": "Cotyledon paniculata, commonly known as the African snowball, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, white or pink flower clusters in late summer, which resemble small snowballs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions with minimal care."
