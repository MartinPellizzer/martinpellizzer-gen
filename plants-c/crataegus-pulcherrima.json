    "intro": "Crataegus pulcherrima, commonly known as the beautiful hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red berries in the fall. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces thorny branches, which are typical features of the Crataegus genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. The fruit of Crataegus pulcherrima is edible but often used in jams and jellies rather than consumed fresh."
