    "intro": "Carex arnellii, commonly known as Arnold's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Carex genus, which is part of the Cyperaceae family, commonly known as the sedge family. This plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. It has grass-like leaves and produces small, three-bracted spikes of flowers. Carex arnellii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
