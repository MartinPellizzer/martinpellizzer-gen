    "intro": "Cactus eximius, commonly known as the giant night-blooming cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height, covered in spines for protection. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of yellow or white. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Cactus eximius is also known for its slow growth rate and long lifespan, sometimes living over a century."
