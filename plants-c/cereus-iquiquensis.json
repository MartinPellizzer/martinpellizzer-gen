    "intro": "Cereus iquiquensis, commonly known as the Iquique candle, is a cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces large, white, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Cereus iquiquensis is well adapted to extreme desert environments with minimal rainfall."
