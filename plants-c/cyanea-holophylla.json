    "intro": "Cyanea holophylla, commonly known as the Hawaiian sea whelk, is a species of sea snail found primarily in the tropical waters of the Pacific Ocean. It belongs to the family Cyanaeidae and is characterized by its large, heavy shell that is typically yellowish or reddish in color. The shell is often adorned with intricate patterns and is resistant to both physical and chemical damage. This species plays an important role in its marine ecosystem as both a predator and a prey item. Its habitat is mainly associated with rocky substrates and coral reefs in shallow to moderately deep waters."
