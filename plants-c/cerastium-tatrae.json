    "intro": "Cerastium tatrae, commonly known as the Tatra chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a slightly waxy texture. Cerastium tatrae is adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
