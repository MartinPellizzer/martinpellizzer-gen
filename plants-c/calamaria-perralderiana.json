    "intro": "Calamaria perralderiana, commonly known as the Perralderian calamaria, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and finely divided, feather-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
