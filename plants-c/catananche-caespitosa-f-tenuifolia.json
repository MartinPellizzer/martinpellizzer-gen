It is characterized by its compact, clump-forming growth habit and features narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flower heads that resemble dandelions, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in Mediterranean climates."
