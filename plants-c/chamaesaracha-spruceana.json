It is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy foliage. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
