    "intro": "Cattleya mossiae var. elegans, commonly known as the Elegant Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid prized for its striking, fragrant flowers. It originates from the tropical regions of South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features long, arching stems with large, velvety petals and a prominent lip that adds to its ornamental appeal. It is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in clusters with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its blooming period typically occurs in the spring, producing clusters of up to 10 flowers per stem."
