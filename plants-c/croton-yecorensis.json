    "intro": "Croton yecorensis, commonly known as the Yecora croton, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, often colorful leaves that vary in shape and hue, which can range from green to red or yellow. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. Croton yecorensis is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage."
