    "intro": "Crepis bockiana, commonly known as the Bock's mouse-ear, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, dandelion-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to Europe, it thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Its scientific name reflects its historical association with the botanist Johann Bock."
