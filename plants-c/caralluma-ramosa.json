    "intro": "Caralluma ramosa, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its branched stems and spiny leaves, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Caralluma ramosa is well adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
