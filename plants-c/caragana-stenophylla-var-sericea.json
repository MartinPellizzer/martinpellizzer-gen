    "intro": "Caragana stenophylla var. sericea, commonly known as the silky caragana, is a shrub native to Central Asia and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, compound leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy plant suitable for dry climates. The silky caragana is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in challenging conditions."
