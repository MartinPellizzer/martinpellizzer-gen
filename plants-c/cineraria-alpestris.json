    "intro": "Cineraria alpestris, commonly known as the alpine cineraria, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its foliage is covered in a fine, white down, which helps to retain moisture and protect against harsh weather. The showy blue or purple flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
