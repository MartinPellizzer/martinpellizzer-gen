    "intro": "Conomorpha fulvopulverulenta, commonly known as the golden dust lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its yellowish to orange-brown thallus, which is covered in a fine, powdery layer of mycobiont particles. The lichen typically grows on bark, stone, or wood in moist, shaded environments. It is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often found in forested areas. Its unique coloration and texture make it easily identifiable among other lichen species."
