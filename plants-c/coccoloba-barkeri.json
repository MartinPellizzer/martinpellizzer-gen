    "intro": "Coccoloba barkeri, commonly known as the Barker's lacquercap, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the Lesser Antilles and parts of the Greater Antilles. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often covered in a waxy coating, and its small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in coastal areas or near freshwater sources. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
