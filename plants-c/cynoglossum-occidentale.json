    "intro": "Cynoglossum occidentale, commonly known as western deadnettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of violet to blue flowers, which are clustered in whorls along the stem. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its scientific name reflects its tongue-shaped (cynoglossum) leaves and western origin."
