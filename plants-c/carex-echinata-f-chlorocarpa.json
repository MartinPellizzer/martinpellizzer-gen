    "intro": "Carex echinata f. chlorocarpa, commonly known as the chlorocarpic sedge, is a variant of the common sedges, characterized by its distinct botanical features. It is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family, known for its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture, and the plant produces spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with a three-parted perianth, typical of the Cyperaceae family. This form is notable for its greenish-tinged fruits, distinguishing it from the typical form of Carex echinata."
