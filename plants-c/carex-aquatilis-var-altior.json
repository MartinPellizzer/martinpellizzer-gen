    "intro": "Carex aquatilis var. altior, commonly known as the tall water sedge, is a wetland plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has tall, slender stems that produce spike-like inflorescences, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic insects."
