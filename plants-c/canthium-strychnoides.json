    "intro": "Canthium strychnoides, commonly known as the poisonwood plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Nigeria and Ghana. The plant is characterized by its woody stem, palmate leaves, and small yellowish-green flowers. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine. However, due to the presence of strychnine and other alkaloids, it is considered highly poisonous and should be handled with caution."
