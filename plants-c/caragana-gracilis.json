    "intro": "Caragana gracilis, commonly known as the slender peashrub, is a deciduous shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. Its seeds are encased in pods and can remain viable in the soil for several years, contributing to its ability to reestablish in disturbed areas."
