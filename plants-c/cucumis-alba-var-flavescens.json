    "intro": "Cucumis alba var. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow wax gourd, is a variant of the white cucumber plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy skin that ranges from pale yellow to deep golden in color. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical fruits that are typically harvested when still immature for optimal flavor and texture. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil for healthy growth. This variety is valued for its unique appearance and mild, slightly sweet flavor, often used in both culinary and ornamental contexts."
