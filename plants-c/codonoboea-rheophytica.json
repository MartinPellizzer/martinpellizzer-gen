    "intro": "Codonoboea rheophytica, commonly known as the water codonopsis, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its unique adaptation to grow on rocky surfaces near waterfalls or streams. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in its humid, high-altitude habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with five petals and prominent stamens, and it produces small, round berries that contain the seeds. Due to its specific ecological requirements, Codonoboea rheophytica is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas."
