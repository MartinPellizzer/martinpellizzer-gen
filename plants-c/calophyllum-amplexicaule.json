    "intro": "Calophyllum amplexicaule, commonly known as the clasping candlewood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, palmate leaves that often clasp the stem, giving it its common name. The plant produces fragrant yellow flowers followed by woody, orange-colored fruits containing toxic seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is also cultivated in some regions for its aesthetic and potential therapeutic uses."
