    "intro": "Cysticapnos grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Viscaceae family and typically grows on the branches of hardwood trees such as oaks and hickories. The plant produces small, green leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Its berries, which are orange-red in color, are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked."
