    "intro": "Cerasus \u00d7 yedoensis, commonly known as the Japanese cherry, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental value, particularly during the spring when it produces clusters of white or pink flowers. The tree typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters and has smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. Its leaves are oval-shaped, serrated, and turn yellow in autumn. The fruit, a small, red drupe, is edible but less commonly consumed compared to its aesthetic appeal."
