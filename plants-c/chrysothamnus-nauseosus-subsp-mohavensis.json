It is characterized by its yellow flowers and aromatic foliage, which are typical features of the genus Chrysothamnus. This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are generally gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
