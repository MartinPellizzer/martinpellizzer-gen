    "intro": "Cactus polygonus, commonly known as the zigzag cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, angular stems that form a zigzag pattern, which helps reduce water loss by minimizing surface area exposed to the sun. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green, spiny structure. Its leaves are modified into spines, which provide protection from herbivores and help in reducing transpiration. Cactus polygonus is well adapted to desert environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive prolonged dry periods."
