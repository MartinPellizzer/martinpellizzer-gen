    "intro": "Cladium cubense, commonly known as the Cuban sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems and broad, grass-like leaves that form dense stands in shallow water. The plant thrives in brackish or freshwater environments, often found in marshes and coastal areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming extensive mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Cladium cubense plays a vital ecological role in maintaining the integrity of wetland ecosystems."
