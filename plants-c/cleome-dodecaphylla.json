    "intro": "Cleome dodecaphylla, commonly known as the \"spider plant\" or \"Mexican spider flower,\" is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, spider-like blooms that appear in clusters of four to six on long, slender stems. The plant is an annual herb that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with lance-shaped, hairy leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals and prominent stamens that give it a unique, almost whimsical appearance. Cleome dodecaphylla thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens."
