    "intro": "Calanthe lyroglossa var. longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract calanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves and distinctive, showy flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant produces inflorescences with elongated bracts that are often as colorful and ornate as the flowers themselves. It thrives in cool, humid environments with partial shade, making it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts. Due to its limited natural habitat and slow growth, it is considered a challenging and valuable addition to botanical collections."
