    "intro": "Cicuta virosa var. tenuifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved water hemlock, is a toxic member of the parsley family (Apiaceae). It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces a highly poisonous compound called cicutoxin, which can be fatal to humans and animals. It typically grows in wet, disturbed soils along stream banks and in marshy areas. Due to its extreme toxicity, it is considered one of the most dangerous plants in North America."
