    "intro": "Celtis pumila var. georgiana, commonly known as the burr oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by spherical, spiky fruits that ripen in the fall. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense colonies, making it a persistent weed in disturbed soils. The species is adapted to a wide range of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and open areas."
