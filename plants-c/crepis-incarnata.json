    "intro": "Crepis incarnata, commonly known as the pink hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pinkish flowers that bloom in summer, often forming dense, tufted clusters. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Crepis incarnata is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in other moist habitats."
