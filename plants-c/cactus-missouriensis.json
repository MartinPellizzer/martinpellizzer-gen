    "intro": "Cactus missouriensis, commonly known as the Missouri prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the central United States. It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its flowers are pollinated by various insects, including bees and butterflies, and the fruit is edible, though it is typically not cultivated for human consumption. The Missouri prickly pear plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing food and shelter for native wildlife."
