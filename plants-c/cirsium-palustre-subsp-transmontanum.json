    "intro": "Cirsium palustre subsp. transmontanum, commonly known as the tall thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, heart-shaped leaves with rough, hairy surfaces. The plant produces purple to pinkish flowers in dense, conical clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
