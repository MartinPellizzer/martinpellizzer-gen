    "intro": "Conophytum albescens, commonly known as the White Stemmed Stone Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming structure. The plant features fleshy, triangular leaves that are pale green to white in color, which help it store water. It produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, and it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Conophytum albescens is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
