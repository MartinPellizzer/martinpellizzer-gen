    "intro": "Caenopteris triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are divided into three distinct lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically found on the underside of its fronds. Caenopteris triloba plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
