    "intro": "Cordia divaricata, commonly known as the red cedar or tropical cedar, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Africa, particularly Tanzania and Kenya. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture and reforestation projects."
