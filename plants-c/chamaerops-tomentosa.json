    "intro": "Chamaerops tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly date palm, is a species of palm native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, tufted leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows as a solitary tree with a short, thick trunk and can reach heights of up to 10 meters. Its fruit is a small, fibrous drupe that contains a single seed, and it is adapted to thrive in coastal and rocky environments. The woolly date palm is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
