    "intro": "Campanula planiflora, commonly known as the flat-leaved bellflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are broad, ovate, and often have a slightly waxy texture. This perennial plant thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
