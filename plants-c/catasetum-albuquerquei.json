    "intro": "Catasetum albuquerquei, commonly known as the Albuquerque orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the arid regions of New Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, often vibrant flowers that can range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its flowering period usually occurs in the spring, and it is known for its specialized pollination mechanism involving specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
