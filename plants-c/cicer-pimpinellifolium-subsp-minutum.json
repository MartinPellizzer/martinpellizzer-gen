    "intro": "Cicer pimpinellifolium subsp. minutum, commonly known as the small-flowered chickpea, is a subspecies of the chickpea plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, pale yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, rounded pods containing one to three seeds, which are used as a legume crop. It is a diploid species with a genome size that is relatively small compared to other chickpea subspecies. This subspecies is valued for its adaptability to marginal soils and its potential in breeding programs for improved agronomic traits."
