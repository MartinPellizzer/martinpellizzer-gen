    "intro": "Caccinia kotschyi, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are often pink or red, blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, reducing water loss through transpiration. Caccinia kotschyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
