    "intro": "Commelina scapiflora, commonly known as the scapiflora spiderwort, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in clusters, often with three petals and three sepals. The plant typically grows from a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread easily in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Commelina scapiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
