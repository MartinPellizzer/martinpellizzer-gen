    "intro": "Caesalpinia bahamensis, commonly known as the Bahamian glorybower, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its striking, bright red to orange inflorescences that resemble small torches, which are highly visible and attract pollinators. The plant has pinnate leaves with lance-shaped leaflets and produces pods that split open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed beyond its native range."
