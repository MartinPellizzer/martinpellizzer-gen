    "intro": "Crepidium floscularium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rock surfaces rather than in soil, typically in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a unique morphology, with a slender, hairless stem and a single, showy white or pale green flower. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions."
