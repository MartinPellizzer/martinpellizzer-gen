    "intro": "Celmisia longifolia var. saxifraga, commonly known as the alpine celmisia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of New Zealand. It features a dense mat of silver-gray, woolly foliage that helps it retain heat in cold environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale pink during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a valued species in New Zealand's native flora."
