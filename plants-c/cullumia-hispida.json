    "intro": "Cullumia hispida, commonly known as the rough cullumia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are often narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cullumia hispida plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain wildlife."
