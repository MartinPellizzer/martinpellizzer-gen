    "intro": "Cynara cardunculus var. eucardunculus, commonly known as the globe thistle, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spherical, spiky blue or purple flower heads surrounded by dense, silver-gray bracts. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The globe thistle is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
