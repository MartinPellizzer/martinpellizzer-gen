    "intro": "Cnicus inermis, commonly known as the common sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, herbaceous structure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a single head, surrounded by pale green bracts. Its leaves are broadly lobed and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, giving them a silvery appearance. Cnicus inermis is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
