    "intro": "Centrolepis exserta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved centrolepis, is a unique plant belonging to the family Cycadaceae. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody, spore-bearing cones. It is a dioecious species, meaning that male and female reproductive structures are found on separate plants. Due to its ancient lineage and distinctive morphology, it is of significant interest in botanical studies."
