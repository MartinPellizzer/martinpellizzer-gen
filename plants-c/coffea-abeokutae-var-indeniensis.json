    "intro": "Coffea abeokutae var. indeniensis, commonly known as the Indeniensis coffee plant, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Coffea genus. It is native to specific regions in West Africa, particularly Nigeria, where it grows in humid, tropical rainforest environments. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds used for coffee production, though it is not widely cultivated commercially. Its botanical characteristics include dark green, oval-shaped leaves and a compact growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and low yield, it remains a subject of interest for botanists and coffee researchers."
