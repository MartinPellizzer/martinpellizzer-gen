    "intro": "Chaetostachys multifida, commonly known as the fringed feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and delicate, feathery inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spikelet-like flowers arranged in a panicle, which are typically green to yellowish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant, airy appearance."
