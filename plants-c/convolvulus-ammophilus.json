    "intro": "Convolvulus ammophilus, commonly known as the sand bindweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as dunes and roadsides. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, while its stems are wiry and often rooting at the nodes. Convolvulus ammophilus plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
