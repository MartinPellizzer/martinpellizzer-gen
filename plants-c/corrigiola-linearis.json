    "intro": "Corrigiola linearis, commonly known as sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand saline and windy conditions. Corrigiola linearis is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
