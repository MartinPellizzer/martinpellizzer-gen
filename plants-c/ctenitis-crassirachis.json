    "intro": "Ctenitis crassirachis, commonly known as the broad-ribbed tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, fibrous root system that helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bright green and have a rough, textured surface. Ctenitis crassirachis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
