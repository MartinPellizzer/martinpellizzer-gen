    "intro": "Cecropia hormigiana, commonly known as the army ant tree, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green bark and large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins. The plant has a unique relationship with army ants, which live in the hollow stems and help protect the tree from herbivores. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed habitats make it a common pioneer species in secondary forests. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing seeds."
