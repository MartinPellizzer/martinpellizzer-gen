    "intro": "Cyclopteris fragilis var. rhaetica, commonly known as the Rhaetian brittle fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, fragile fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are pinnately divided with a distinctive, almost delicate appearance. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
