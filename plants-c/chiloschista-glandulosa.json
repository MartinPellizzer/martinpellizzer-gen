    "intro": "Chiloschista glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular chiloschista, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white or greenish flowers. The plant is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils in arid or semi-arid regions. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The species is notable for its glandular structures on the leaves, which contribute to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations."
