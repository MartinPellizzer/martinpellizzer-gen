    "intro": "Coffea fotsoana, commonly known as the Fotsoana coffee plant, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1\u20132 meters. The plant produces small, white flowers that give way to red, fleshy berries containing the seeds used for coffee. Its leaves are elliptical and have a glossy appearance, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and unique characteristics, Coffea fotsoana is considered a rare and potentially valuable species in the coffee world."
