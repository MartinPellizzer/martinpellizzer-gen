    "intro": "Cogswellia vaginata, commonly known as the sand mat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise sparse foliage. Its leaves are typically small, linear, and arranged in a dense mat-like structure, which helps it conserve water. Cogswellia vaginata is well adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
