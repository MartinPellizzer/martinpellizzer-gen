    "intro": "Cirsium erisithales subsp. glutinosum, commonly known as the sticky thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a milky, sticky sap, which is a distinguishing feature of the Cirsium genus. It typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The subspecies glutinosum is notable for its more robust growth and increased sticky secretions compared to other members of the species."
