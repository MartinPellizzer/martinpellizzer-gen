    "intro": "Cyathea microphylla, commonly known as the silver tree, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand.

The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for over 100 years, making it a long-lived species. Its fronds are covered in a silvery, powdery bloom, which gives it its common name. Cyathea microphylla plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat and food for various native species."
