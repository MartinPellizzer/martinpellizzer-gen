    "intro": "Cerastium moesiacum subsp. glutinosum, commonly known as sticky mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Central and Eastern Europe. It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has hairy, often sticky stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its subspecific name, *glutinosum*, refers to the sticky texture of its foliage."
