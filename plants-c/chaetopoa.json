    "intro": "Chaetopoa, commonly known as the hairy sea anemone, is a marine cnidarian belonging to the order Actiniaria. It is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body covered in fine, hair-like structures called chaetae, which give it its name. The polyp-like body of Chaetopoa is typically pale in color, ranging from white to pink or brown, and it lacks a distinct oral disc. It is found in shallow coastal waters and can be observed in tide pools or on rocky substrates. This species plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and serving as prey for various fish and crustaceans."
