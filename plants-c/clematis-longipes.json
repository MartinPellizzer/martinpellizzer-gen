    "intro": "Clematis longipes, commonly known as the longipes clematis, is a climbing vine native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are typically blue or purple, appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, elongated fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental climbers. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments rather than in the wild."
