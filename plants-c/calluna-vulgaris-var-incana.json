    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris var. incana, commonly known as heather, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with dense, evergreen foliage that is typically covered in a fine, silvery-white layer of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and moorlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to form dense, long-lasting ground cover."
