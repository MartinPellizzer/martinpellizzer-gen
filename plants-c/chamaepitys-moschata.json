    "intro": "Chamaepitys moschata, commonly known as the sweet birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, aromatic bark that exudes a balsamic scent when exposed to air. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall. The plant is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its antiseptic and analgesic qualities."
