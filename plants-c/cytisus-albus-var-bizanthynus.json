    "intro": "Cytisus albus var. bizanthynus, commonly known as the white broom or white genista, is a shrub native to the Balkans and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are pinnate, consisting of several pairs of elliptical leaflets, and the plant is typically evergreen or semi-evergreen depending on the climate. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a hedge plant."
