    "intro": "Combretum illairii, commonly known as the red sandalwood. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa, characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic and practical properties."
