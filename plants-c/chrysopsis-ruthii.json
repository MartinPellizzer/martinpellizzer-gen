    "intro": "Chrysopsis ruthii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with hairy stems and basal leaves that are spoon-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Chrysopsis ruthii is adapted to withstand drought and has a deep root system to access groundwater."
