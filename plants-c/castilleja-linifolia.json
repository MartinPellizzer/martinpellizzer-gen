    "intro": "Castilleja linifolia, commonly known as the silky leaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers that resemble paintbrushes. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands, often growing in association with other plants. Castilleja linifolia relies on root connections to host plants for some of its nutrients, making it a hemiparasite."
