    "intro": "Chassalia coriacea var. johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's rough chassalia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are coriaceous, meaning they are thick and leathery, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
