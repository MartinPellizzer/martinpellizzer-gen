    "intro": "Caladenia atrovespa, commonly known as the black-veined spider orchid, is a striking terrestrial orchid native to Western Australia. It features a slender, erect stem with a single, dark purple or blackish flower that has intricate veining. The orchid's flower has a narrow, hood-like labellum and is typically about 5\u20137 cm in height. It blooms in late winter to early spring, often in open habitats such as sandplains and gravelly areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
