    "intro": "Croton faroensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian croton, is a tropical shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often brightly colored in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by woody, spiny capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a garden plant, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
