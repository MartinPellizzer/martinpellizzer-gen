    "intro": "Cirsium pulcherrimum, commonly known as the showy thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and large, showy purple or pink flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cirsium pulcherrimum is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
