    "intro": "Camaridium neglectum, commonly known as the neglected camara, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, waxy leaves that are a deep shade of emerald green and its clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its blooming season typically occurs during the late spring and early summer months. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
