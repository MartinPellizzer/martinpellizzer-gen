    "intro": "Cuscuta atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to regions of the southeastern United States and is often found growing on crops such as soybeans and cotton. Its life cycle involves germinating on the surface of the host plant and then establishing a connection through specialized root-like structures called haustoria. Cuscuta atlantica plays a role in both ecological interactions and agricultural challenges due to its parasitic nature."
