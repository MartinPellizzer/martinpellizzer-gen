    "intro": "Cyphostemma muhuluense, commonly known as the Muhulu cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its branching stems covered in spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Cyphostemma muhuluense is adapted to survive in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in savannas and shrublands."
