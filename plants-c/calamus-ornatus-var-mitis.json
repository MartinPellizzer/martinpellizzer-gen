    "intro": "Calamus ornatus var. mitis, commonly known as the soft calamus, is a member of the Aroid family (Araceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically borne on a spadix, which is surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or marshy areas. Due to its ornamental appeal and unique foliage, it is cultivated in some horticultural settings."
