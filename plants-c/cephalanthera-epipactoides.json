    "intro": "Cephalanthera epipactoides, commonly known as the yellow helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear lance-shaped leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive hooded labellum. The plant is notable for its lack of chlorophyll, making it a myco-heterotroph that relies on fungal associations for nutrients. It typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is found across Europe and parts of Asia. Due to its specialized habitat and conservation status, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
