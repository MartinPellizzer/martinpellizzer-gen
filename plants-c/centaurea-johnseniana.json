It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Its vivid purple to red flowers bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
