    "intro": "Corytholoma tuberosum, commonly known as the tuberous bellflower, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its tuberous roots, which store nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue and violet, often with a white throat. Its leaves are typically basal, forming a rosette structure that helps conserve moisture. Corytholoma tuberosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
