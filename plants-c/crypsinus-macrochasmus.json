    "intro": "Crypsinus macrochasmus, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It features large, broad leaves that can grow up to two meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant's showy white flowers bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate, allowing it to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The leaves have a waxy surface that repels water, helping to maintain buoyancy and reduce evaporation."
