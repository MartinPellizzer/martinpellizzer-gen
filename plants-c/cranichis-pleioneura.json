It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. It has a rhizomatous root system and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species."
