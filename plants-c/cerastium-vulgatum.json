    "intro": "Cerastium vulgatum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Cerastium vulgatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in garden settings for its delicate foliage and early blooming habit."
