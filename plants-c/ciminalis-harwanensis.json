    "intro": "Ciminalis harwanensis, commonly known as the Harwan ciminalis, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its slender stems and delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
