    "intro": "Cyperus pumilus var. patens, commonly known as the dwarf umbrella sedge, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, narrow leaves arranged in a dense, grass-like rosette, with short, upright stems that bear clusters of tiny, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, pale brown flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of water bodies. Its ornamental appeal makes it a popular choice for water gardens and bog landscapes."
