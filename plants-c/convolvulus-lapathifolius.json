    "intro": "Convolvulus lapathifolius, commonly known as the lesser bindweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces small, pale yellow flowers with five petals. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and a trailing or climbing growth habit, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. It is sometimes considered a weed due to its aggressive growth but also has historical uses in traditional medicine."
