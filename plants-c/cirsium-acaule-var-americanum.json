It features a rosette of spiny, lobed leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant produces purple to pink flowers in dense, spherical clusters called heads, which appear in late summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along fences. Its extensive root system allows it to persist in various habitats and can make it difficult to eradicate."
