    "intro": "Cyrtanthus helictus, commonly known as the Hart's tongue orchid, is a South African bulbous plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Cyrtanthus helictus is also noted for its ability to naturalize and form dense clusters over time."
