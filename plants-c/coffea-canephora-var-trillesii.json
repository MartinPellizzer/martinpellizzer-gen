    "intro": "Coffea canephora var. trillesii, commonly known as the African coffee bean, is a variant of the robusta coffee species native to central and western Africa. It is characterized by its large, oval-shaped berries and dark green, glossy leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. It produces a robusta-type coffee with a strong, bitter flavor and higher caffeine content compared to arabica varieties. This variety is well-suited to tropical climates with high rainfall and well-drained soils."
