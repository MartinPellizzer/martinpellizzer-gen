    "intro": "Calamus schizospathus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved calamus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spadices, a common feature among many palms. Calamus schizospathus is often found in wetland or swampy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland restoration projects."
