    "intro": "Conobea multifida, commonly known as the broad-leafed conobea, is a member of the Araliaceae family. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that give it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. Native to tropical regions of South America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal. Conobea multifida produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans."
