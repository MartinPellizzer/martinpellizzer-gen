It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and oval, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and mammals. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and open areas. Crataegus horrida is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting wildlife."
