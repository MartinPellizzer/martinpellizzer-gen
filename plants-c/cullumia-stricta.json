    "intro": "Cullumia stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf cullumia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Cullumia stricta is adapted to dry conditions and has a low, compact growth form that helps it conserve water."
