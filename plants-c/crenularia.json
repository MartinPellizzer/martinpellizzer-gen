    "intro": "Crenularia, commonly known as the \"buttonweed\" or \"lawn buttercup,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Aizoaceae. It is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plants are characterized by their small, fleshy leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers that often have a distinctive yellow center. Crenularia species are typically low-growing and form dense mats, making them popular in rock gardens and dry landscapes. They are also valued for their ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
