    "intro": "Carex viridis var. divulsa, commonly known as the green sedge. This variant is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the tips of its flowering stems, which are usually shorter than the foliage. Its leaves are generally narrow, grass-like, and have a bluish-green hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
