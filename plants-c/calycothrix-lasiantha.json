    "intro": "Calycothrix lasiantha, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native plants and is considered a weed in some areas."
