    "intro": "Cyanthillium vernonioides, commonly known as the yellow ironwood, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody structure and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, round fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
