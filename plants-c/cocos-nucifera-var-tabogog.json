    "intro": "Cocos nucifera var. tabogog, commonly known as the Tabogog coconut, is a variant of the coconut palm native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves. The fruit of this variety is typically smaller than the common coconut, with a thick husk and a sweet, aromatic kernel inside. It thrives in tropical climates and requires well-drained soil and ample sunlight. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its edible fruit."
