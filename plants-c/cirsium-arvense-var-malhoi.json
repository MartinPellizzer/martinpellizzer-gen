It is characterized by its spiny, prickly leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The species is known for its aggressive growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. It plays a role in supporting pollinators but is also considered a weed in agricultural settings."
