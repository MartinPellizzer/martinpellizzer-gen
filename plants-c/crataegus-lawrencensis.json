    "intro": "Crataegus lawrencensis, commonly known as Lawrence hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds and other wildlife but are generally not consumed by humans. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with serrated edges, and turn vibrant yellow or orange in the fall. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodlands and along stream banks."
