    "intro": "Cryptocarya oligophlebia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cryptocarya, is a species of flowering plant in the Lauraceae family. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in rainforest and wet sclerophyll forest ecosystems. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It produces small, dark blue or black berries that are an important food source for various native animals. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
