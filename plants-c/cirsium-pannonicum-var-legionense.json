It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and large, purple-pink flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its rigid stems and dense foliage make it a distinctive member of the Asteraceae family. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
