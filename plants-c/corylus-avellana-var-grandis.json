It is characterized by its large, robust leaves and the presence of distinctive, curved bracts that resemble horns, giving it its common name. The plant produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, which are typically harvested in the fall. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible yield. This variety is also valued for its hardiness and ability to grow in a range of soil types."
