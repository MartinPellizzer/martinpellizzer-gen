    "intro": "Cynanchum confusum, commonly known as the confused milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes other milkweeds known for their toxic sap. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release tiny seeds with silky parachutes for wind dispersal. Cynanchum confusum is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade."
