    "intro": "Chamaecrista cytisoides var. decora, commonly known as the pink coralbean, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in long, slender pods that split open to release the seeds, a feature typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils in full sun."
