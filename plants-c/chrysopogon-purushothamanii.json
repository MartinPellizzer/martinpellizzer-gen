    "intro": "Chrysopogon purushothamanii, commonly known as the Purushothamanii grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid regions."
