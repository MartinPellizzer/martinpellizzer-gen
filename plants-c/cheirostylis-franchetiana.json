    "intro": "Cheirostylis franchetiana, commonly known as the Franchet's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated flower spikes that bear pale yellow to white blossoms with intricate, veined patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists alike."
