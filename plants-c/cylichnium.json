    "intro": "Cylichnium, commonly known as the sand spiker, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Cyperaceae. These plants are characterized by their slender, grass-like stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. They are typically found in sandy or coastal environments, where they thrive in well-drained soils. Cylichnium species are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize sand dunes. Their life cycle is adapted to harsh conditions, with some species being annuals that complete their growth cycle quickly in response to environmental cues."
