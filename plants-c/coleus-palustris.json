It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue to purple in color, arranged in spikes at the top of the stems. It thrives in moist, wetland environments and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Coleus palustris is a herbaceous perennial that is valued for its ornamental foliage and ecological importance in wetland habitats."
