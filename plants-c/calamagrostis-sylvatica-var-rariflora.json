    "intro": "Calamagrostis sylvatica var. rariflora, commonly known as the rare-flowered woodland reed, is a perennial grass native to Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or gray. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing delicate, panicle-like inflorescences with pale green to golden flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
