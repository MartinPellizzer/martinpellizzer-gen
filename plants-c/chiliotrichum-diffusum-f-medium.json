The plant has a mat-forming habit, with hairy stems and leaves that are typically covered in fine, white trichomes. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a unique and ornamental addition to rock gardens and alpine displays."
