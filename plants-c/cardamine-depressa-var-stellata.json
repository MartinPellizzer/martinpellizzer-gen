    "intro": "Cardamine depressa var. stellata, commonly known as the starleaf watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features small, delicate leaves that are often arranged in a star-like pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous, and it is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and along the edges of ponds. The species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
