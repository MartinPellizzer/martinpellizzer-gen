    "intro": "Carex echinata subsp. hydrophila, commonly known as the water sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. The plant thrives in moist to submerged conditions, making it a common species in marshes, ponds, and stream margins. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and contribute to wetland ecosystems. The subspecies hydrophila is distinguished by its more aquatic adaptations compared to the typical Carex echinata."
