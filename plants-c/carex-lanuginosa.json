    "intro": "Carex lanuginosa, commonly known as the downy sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-brown flowers in spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Carex lanuginosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it ecologically significant in its habitat."
