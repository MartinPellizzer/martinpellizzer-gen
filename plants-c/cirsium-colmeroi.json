    "intro": "Cirsium colmeroi, commonly known as the Colmer's thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with gray-green, spiny leaves and showy purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its robust stem and hairy foliage are adaptations to its harsh, alpine habitat. Cirsium colmeroi is often found in rocky soils and is a notable species in high-altitude ecosystems."
