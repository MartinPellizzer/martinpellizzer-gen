    "intro": "Crotalaria homalocarpa, commonly known as the waxy bean or African spurred orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking, spurred flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has palmate leaves with three to five lobes and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its seeds are encased in a hard, waxy coating, which aids in their dispersal. Crotalaria homalocarpa is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
