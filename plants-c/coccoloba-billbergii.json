It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows near coastal areas, often in brackish or saline soils. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its flowers are small, clustered, and usually pink or white. It produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed, and it plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
