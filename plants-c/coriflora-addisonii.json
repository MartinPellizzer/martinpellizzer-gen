    "intro": "Coriflora addisonii, commonly known as the Addison's coriflora, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, velvety purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its habitat. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters and are pollinated by specific species of bees. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Coriflora addisonii is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
