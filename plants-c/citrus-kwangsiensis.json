    "intro": "Citrus kwangsiensis, commonly known as the Guangxi citrus or Guangxi lemon, is a rare and lesser-known citrus species native to southern China. It is characterized by its small, yellow-orange fruits that are typically less than 2 inches in diameter. The plant produces fragrant white flowers and has dark green, glossy leaves. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and unique characteristics, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
