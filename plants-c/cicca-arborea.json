    "intro": "Cicca arborea, commonly known as the tree cycad, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
