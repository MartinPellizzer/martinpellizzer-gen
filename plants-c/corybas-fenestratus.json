    "intro": "Corybas fenestratus, commonly known as the windowed helmet orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its striking, helmet-shaped flowers that are often brightly colored, with a distinctive window-like opening on the dorsal side of the labellum. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded forest environments, where it thrives in the understorey of native vegetation. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often forming a rosette at the base of the plant. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
