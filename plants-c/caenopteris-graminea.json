    "intro": "Caenopteris graminea, commonly known as the grass fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like fronds that are usually slender and arching. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Caenopteris graminea plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
