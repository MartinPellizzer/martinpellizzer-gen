It features slender, branching stems covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in streamside habitats and moist woodlands."
