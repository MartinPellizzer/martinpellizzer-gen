    "intro": "Cichorium sylvestre, commonly known as woodland chicory, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of dark green, spoon-shaped leaves and produces blue or purple flowers in the summer. The plant is characterized by its bitter taste, which comes from compounds such as lactucin and lactucopicrin. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The leaves and flowers are used in herbal medicine and as a vegetable, though it is less commonly cultivated than its relative, chicory."
