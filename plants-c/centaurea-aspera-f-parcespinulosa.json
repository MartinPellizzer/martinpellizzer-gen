    "intro": "Centaurea aspera f. parcespinulosa, commonly known as the sparse-spinulose bluemink, is a botanical variant of the common centaury. It is characterized by its reduced and sparse arrangement of spinulose (bristly) structures on its flower heads. The plant typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue or purple flowers. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. This form is noted for its distinct morphology, which sets it apart from the typical form of Centaurea aspera."
