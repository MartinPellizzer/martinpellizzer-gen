    "intro": "Calliandra pyrophila, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical leguminous shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange inflorescences that resemble flames, which appear during the dry season. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions. Calliandra pyrophila is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility."
