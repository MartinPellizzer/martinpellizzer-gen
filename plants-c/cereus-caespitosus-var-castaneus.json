    "intro": "Cereus caespitosus var. castaneus, commonly known as the red torch cactus, is a species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a perennial cactus characterized by its dense, spiny clusters of stems that form a compact, rounded shape. The plant produces striking red flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid climates. Its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit make it a popular choice for desert gardens and rockeries."
