    "intro": "Clidemia capillipes, commonly known as the hairy mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It typically grows on the branches of other trees, drawing nutrients and water from its host through specialized roots. Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the growth and health of its host plants."
