    "intro": "Cystopteris modesta, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp woodlands. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. Cystopteris modesta is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitats."
