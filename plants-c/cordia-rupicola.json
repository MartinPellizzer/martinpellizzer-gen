    "intro": "Cordia rupicola, commonly known as the rock cordia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, spherical fruits. Its adaptability to rocky soils and drought conditions makes it a resilient species in tropical regions. Cordia rupicola is also valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal uses."
