    "intro": "Centaurea baldensis, commonly known as the Bald Mountain cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Centaurea baldensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and supports local pollinator populations."
