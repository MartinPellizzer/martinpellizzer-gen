    "intro": "Carex aperta var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually narrow and pointed, with a smooth surface. Its inflorescence consists of a single, elongated spike of small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
