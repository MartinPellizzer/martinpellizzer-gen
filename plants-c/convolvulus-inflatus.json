    "intro": "Convolvulus inflatus, commonly known as the inflated convolvulus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the bindweed family, Convolvulaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, inflated seed pods. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous annual with trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to white, and they bloom in clusters. The inflated seed pods, which give the plant its common name, are adapted for wind dispersal of its seeds."
