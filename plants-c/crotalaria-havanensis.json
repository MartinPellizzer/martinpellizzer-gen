It belongs to the family Fabaceae, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers with a distinctive spurred shape, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated, woody pods that split open when mature. Crotalaria havanensis is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its bright, showy blooms."
