    "intro": "Campanula cervicaria var. lingulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions, and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features slender stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lanceolate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, bell-like blossoms."
