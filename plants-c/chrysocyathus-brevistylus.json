    "intro": "Chrysocyathus brevistylus, commonly known as the short-styled chrysocyathus, is a rare and delicate marine sponge found in shallow tropical waters. It belongs to the family Chrysocyathidae and is characterized by its small, branching structure with a distinctive, short stylus. The sponge's body is composed of a porous skeleton made of siliceous spicules, which provide structural support. It typically grows on coral substrates and is often found in reef environments. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
