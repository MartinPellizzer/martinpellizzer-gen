    "intro": "Cereus grandiflorus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night and remain open for only one night. These flowers are often pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths. Cereus grandiflorus is a slow-growing plant that requires minimal water and thrives in well-draining soil."
