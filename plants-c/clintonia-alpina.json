    "intro": "Clintonia alpina, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas, often in the understory of coniferous or mixed hardwood forests. The plant features showy, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Clintonia alpina is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its aesthetic presence in woodland gardens."
