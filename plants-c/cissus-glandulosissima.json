It is characterized by its distinctive glandular hairs that cover its stems and leaves, giving it a sticky texture. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets and produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often used in ornamental horticulture. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a notable species within the Cissus genus."
