    "intro": "Claytonia lingulata, commonly known as the \"peanut violet,\" is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features a low-growing rosette of fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are edible and have a mild, slightly peppery flavor, making it a popular plant in native plant gardens. Claytonia lingulata thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas."
