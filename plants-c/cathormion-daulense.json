    "intro": "Cathormion daulense, commonly known as the Daulen's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers and slender, wiry stems that often grow from the base of its leaves. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a unique structure that resembles a ghostly apparition, giving it its common name. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cathormion daulense is considered a critically endangered species."
