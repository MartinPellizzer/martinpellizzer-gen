    "intro": "Carex monile var. pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially sunny environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color, and it produces small, clustered spikes of pale to brownish flowers in the summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats. This variety is a hardy, low-maintenance plant suitable for both natural and landscaped settings."
