    "intro": "Cissus erosa, commonly known as the bonebrake or rock fig, is a climbing shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Cissus erosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses."
