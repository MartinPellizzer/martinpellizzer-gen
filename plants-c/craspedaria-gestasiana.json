    "intro": "Craspedaria gestasiana, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its small, strap-like leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces a modest number of blooms during the wet season. Due to habitat destruction, Craspedaria gestasiana is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
