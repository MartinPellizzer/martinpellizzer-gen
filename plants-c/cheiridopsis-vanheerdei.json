It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, known for its succulent characteristics and ability to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. It is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
