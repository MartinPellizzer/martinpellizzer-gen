    "intro": "Cuscuta macrolepis, commonly known as the giant dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with thread-like stems that attach to host plants. The plant's seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for many years. It is native to various regions in the Americas and is often found on crops such as beans and sunflowers. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural plants."
