    "intro": "Chrozophora obliquifolia, commonly known as the zigzag mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging stems and heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Chrozophora obliquifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
