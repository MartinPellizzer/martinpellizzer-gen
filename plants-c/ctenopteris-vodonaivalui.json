    "intro": "Ctenopteris vodonaivalui, commonly known as the Vodonaivalu fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical rainforests of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing both spores and seeds, which is relatively uncommon among ferns. Its leaves are typically arranged in a spiral pattern and can reach lengths of up to two meters. Due to its restricted habitat, Ctenopteris vodonaivalui is considered a rare and endangered species."
