    "intro": "Christiana vescoana, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. Its seeds are enclosed in a three-lobed, hairy capsule that splits open when mature. Christiana vescoana is often found in wetlands and disturbed soils, and it can become invasive in certain regions."
