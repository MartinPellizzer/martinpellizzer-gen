    "intro": "Cerasus macrophylla, commonly known as the double-flowered cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is prized for its showy, double blooms that appear in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. Its flowers are typically pink or white, and they emit a subtle fragrance. Cerasus macrophylla is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional Japanese culture."
