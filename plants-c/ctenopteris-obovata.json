    "intro": "Ctenopteris obovata, commonly known as the broad-leaf sea palm, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its large, leathery, obovate fronds that are often dark green and have a rough texture. The plant grows in coastal areas, typically in shallow water or on rocky substrates, and is adapted to saline environments. Its rhizomes form dense clusters, and the fronds are arranged in a rosette pattern. Ctenopteris obovata plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
