It features compound leaves with elongated, narrow leaflets that are often arranged in pairs. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that are clustered in racemes, typical of the Fabaceae family. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated pods, which split open to release the seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
