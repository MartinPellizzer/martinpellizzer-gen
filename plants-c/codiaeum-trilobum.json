It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful leaves that display shades of red, orange, and yellow, often with intricate patterns. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its striking foliage rather than its flowers. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated as a houseplant and in gardens."
