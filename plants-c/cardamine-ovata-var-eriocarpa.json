    "intro": "Cardamine ovata var. eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly watercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its stems are often covered in a dense, woolly coating of fine hairs, which gives it its common name. The fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature."
