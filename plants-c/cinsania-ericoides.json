    "intro": "Cinsania ericoides, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clustered flowers. The plant typically produces pink or white bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
