It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshade plants, and is characterized by its striking, fragrant white flowers that open at night. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, glossy leaves and smooth, bark-like stems. Its flowers are tubular and often have a reddish or purplish tint at the base, while the fruit is a small, yellow, fleshy berry. Cestrum unibracteatum is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and nocturnal blooming habit."
