    "intro": "Cyperus constrictus, commonly known as the nutsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, clustered leaves that are often mistaken for grasses. The plant produces small, three-sided spikelets that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, ditches, and along waterways. Cyperus constrictus is known for its aggressive growth and is often considered a weed in agricultural and aquatic settings."
