    "intro": "Chrysophyllum boukokoense, commonly known as the Boukoko cherry, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces edible fruits that are similar to cherries, with a sweet, acidic flavor. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and fruit production, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and agroforestry systems."
