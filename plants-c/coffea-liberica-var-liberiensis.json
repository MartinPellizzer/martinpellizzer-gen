    "intro": "Coffea liberica var. liberiensis, commonly known as the Liberian coffee. It is a wild variety native to West Africa, particularly Liberia, and is characterized by its large, elongated leaves and robust growth habit. This subspecies is often considered a wild ancestor of cultivated Liberica coffee, which is known for its strong, smoky flavor profile. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soils. Due to its wild nature, it is less commonly cultivated than other coffee species but remains important for genetic diversity in coffee breeding programs."
