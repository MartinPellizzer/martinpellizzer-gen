    "intro": "Chimonobambusa jainiana, commonly known as the Jain bamboo, is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is native to the Himalayan region of India. It is a clump-forming bamboo that typically grows in moist, temperate climates at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. Its culms are hollow and segmented, characteristic of the bamboo genus, and are often used in traditional crafts and construction. Chimonobambusa jainiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
