    "intro": "Cyrtosia septentrionalis f. flava, commonly known as the yellow-flowered form of the northern cyrtosia, is a rare and distinctive plant species within the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which contrast with its typically green foliage. The plant is native to specific regions in the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a smooth texture, while its stems are woody and somewhat shrub-like. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral characteristics, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
