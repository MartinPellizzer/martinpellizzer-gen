    "intro": "Cissus viscosa, commonly known as the rock fig or stone cissus, is a trailing vine native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, white, waxy bumps. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliffs or among rocks. Cissus viscosa is also valued for its ability to climb and its use in traditional medicine."
