    "intro": "Carex ruesanensis, commonly known as the Ruesan's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in poorly drained soils and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Carex ruesanensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to filter water."
