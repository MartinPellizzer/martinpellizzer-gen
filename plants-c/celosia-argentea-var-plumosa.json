    "intro": "Celosia argentea var. plumosa, commonly known as the plume celosia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, feathery inflorescences that resemble plumes, which are composed of numerous small, brightly colored bracts. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower due to its long-lasting blooms. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, requiring minimal water once established. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, silvery hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
