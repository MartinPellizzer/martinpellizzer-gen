    "intro": "Coursetia vicioides, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and heat. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
