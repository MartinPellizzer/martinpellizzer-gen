    "intro": "Calophyllum amoenum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Calophyllaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and dense, aromatic wood. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries containing a single seed. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and elliptic in shape, often with a glossy surface. Due to its valuable timber, Calophyllum amoenum is often harvested for its wood, leading to conservation concerns in its natural habitats."
