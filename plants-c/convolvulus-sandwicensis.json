    "intro": "Convolvulus sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
