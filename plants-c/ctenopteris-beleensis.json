    "intro": "Ctenopteris beleensis, commonly known as the Bele's sea hare, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its floating, leafy fronds that resemble those of water clovers. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Ctenopteris beleensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
