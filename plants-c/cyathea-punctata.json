    "intro": "Cyathea punctata, commonly known as the punctate tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately divided fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to grow in shaded, moist environments. Its fronds are typically dark green with a leathery texture and can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. Cyathea punctata plays an important ecological role in tropical forests by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
