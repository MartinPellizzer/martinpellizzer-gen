    "intro": "Cacalia chenopodiifolia, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has a low, sprawling growth habit with hairy, lobed leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to white, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Cacalia chenopodiifolia is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in environments with limited water availability."
