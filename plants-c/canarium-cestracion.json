    "intro": "Canarium cestracion, commonly known as the white nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces an aromatic fruit that contains a hard, oily seed, which is the source of the spice known as nutmeg. Its botanical features include a thick, corky bark and a dense, rounded canopy. Canarium cestracion is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its economic importance in the spice trade."
