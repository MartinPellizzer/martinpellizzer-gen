    "intro": "Coelogyne bulleyia, commonly known as the Bulleyia orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters of up to 20, often in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a fan-like pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Coelogyne bulleyia is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively ease of cultivation."
