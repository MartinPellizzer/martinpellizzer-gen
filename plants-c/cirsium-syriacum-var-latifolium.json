It features spiny, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting large, palmately lobed leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces purple to violet flower heads, which are composed of numerous small florets arranged in a composite flower structure. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its ornamental value and hardy nature make it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
