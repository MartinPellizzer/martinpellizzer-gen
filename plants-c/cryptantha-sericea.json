It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and plains, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Cryptantha sericea is often found in open grasslands and is adapted to arid environments with minimal water availability."
