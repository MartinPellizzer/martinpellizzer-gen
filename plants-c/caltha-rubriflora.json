    "intro": "Caltha rubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in northern regions. It features striking red-orange flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has a basal rosette of heart-shaped, glossy green leaves that help it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to waterlogged soils, allowing it to flourish in marshes and along stream edges. Caltha rubriflora plays an important ecological role by providing early nectar sources for pollinators."
