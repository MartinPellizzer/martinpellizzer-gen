    "intro": "Carduus drummondii var. acaulescens, commonly known as Drummond's thistle, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its spiny, leafy stems and large, showy purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. It has a rosette of basal leaves and is known for its hardy, drought-resistant nature. The variety acaulescens is distinguished by its lack of a distinct stem, with the leaves forming a dense, compact cluster near the ground."
