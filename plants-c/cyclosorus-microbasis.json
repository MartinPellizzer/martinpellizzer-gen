    "intro": "Cyclosorus microbasis, commonly known as the small-leafed water shield, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. The plant has narrow, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, which helps reduce water loss. Its reproductive structures, including small, inconspicuous flowers, develop on the water surface, and it produces tiny, buoyant fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Cyclosorus microbasis plays a role in stabilizing water bodies and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
