    "intro": "Calanthe chevalieri, commonly known as the Chevalier's calanthe, is a rare and elegant orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features a compact, rhizomatous growth habit with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky pubescence. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adorned with intricate patterns and a prominent lip. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-drained, humus-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
