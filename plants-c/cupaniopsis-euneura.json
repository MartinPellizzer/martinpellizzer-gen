    "intro": "Cupaniopsis euneura, commonly known as the stinking ant plant, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of northern Australia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often visited by various insect pollinators. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with features that help it conserve water and withstand harsh conditions."
