It is a low-growing annual herb with small, white flowers and heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. The variant is characterized by slight morphological differences from the typical form, including variations in leaf shape and flower structure."
