    "intro": "Cryptandra angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf cryptandra, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a member of the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is found in regions with a Mediterranean climate. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are adapted for dispersal by animals. Cryptandra angustifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in degraded environments."
