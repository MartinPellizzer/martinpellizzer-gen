    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris var. bifida, commonly known as the bifid weed or devil's-bit scabious, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant has a low, spreading growth habit with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed. Its fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that splits open to release small, rounded seeds. This variety is distinguished by its bifid (split) leaves, which set it apart from the typical form of the species."
