It features square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, fragrant blue to purple flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and aromatic properties. This variety is closely related to the common catnip plant, Nepeta cataria, but differs in its floral structure and fragrance."
