    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia subvar. puberula, commonly known as the hairy bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. This variety is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
