    "intro": "Croton nitrariifolius, commonly known as the sand croton, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its succulent nature allows it to thrive in sandy soils with minimal water availability. Croton nitrariifolius is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
