It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant is often found growing in humid, shaded environments such as montane forests. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
