    "intro": "Carex glauca var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine blue sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, which helps it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers, a common adaptation in alpine flora. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra habitats. Due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural conditions."
