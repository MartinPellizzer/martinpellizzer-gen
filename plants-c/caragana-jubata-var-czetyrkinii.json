    "intro": "Caragana jubata var. czetyrkinii, commonly known as the Fourkinii shrub, is a deciduous shrub native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by pea-like pods containing seeds. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval leaflets that help reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing sandy soils."
