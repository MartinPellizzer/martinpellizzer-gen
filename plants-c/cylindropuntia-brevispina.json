It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in small, pale green spines. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid environments. It produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
