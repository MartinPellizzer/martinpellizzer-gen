    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris aequinoctialis, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white or pink flowers and heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, round seed pods that split open when mature, releasing tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along pathways. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed but also a valuable plant for ecological studies."
