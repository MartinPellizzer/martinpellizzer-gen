    "intro": "Circaea quadrisulcata, commonly known as the four-ribbed wintergreen, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the northern regions of North America. It features small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has a distinctive four-ribbed stem and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant leaves that emit a wintergreen scent. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
