    "intro": "Caltha palustris var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf marsh marigold, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetlands and moist meadows in northern regions. It features delicate, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It thrives in poorly drained soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its compact size and early blooming habit, it is a valuable plant for pollinators and adds visual interest to wetland gardens."
