    "intro": "Codonorchis poeppigii, commonly known as the Poeppig's lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and a long, spiraled flower spike that bears numerous small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and meadows. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake. Codonorchis poeppigii is known for its delicate appearance and is often found in association with other orchid species in its habitat."
