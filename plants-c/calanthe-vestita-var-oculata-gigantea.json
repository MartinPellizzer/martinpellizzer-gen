    "intro": "Calanthe vestita var. oculata-gigantea, commonly known as the giant eye orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that feature prominent, eye-like patterns on the petals and sepals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to retain moisture in its moist, tropical habitat. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
