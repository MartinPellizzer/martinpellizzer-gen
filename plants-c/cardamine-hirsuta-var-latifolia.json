    "intro": "Cardamine hirsuta var. latifolia, commonly known as broad-leaved hairy watercress, is a variant of the hairy watercress species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are hairy and often reddish in color. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in a loose cluster, and it produces elongated, cylindrical seed pods. This variant is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to other watercress species."
