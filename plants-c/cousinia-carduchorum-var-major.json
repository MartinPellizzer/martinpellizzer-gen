It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in composite inflorescences. It is well adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting succulent leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. This variety is notable for its robust growth and ornamental value in dryland gardens."
