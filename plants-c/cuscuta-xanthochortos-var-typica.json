    "intro": "Cuscuta xanthochortos var. typica, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that\u7f20\u7ed5 (twine) around its hosts. The plant is native to regions of Australia and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth and health of its host plants."
