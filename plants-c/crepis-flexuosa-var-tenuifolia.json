    "intro": "Crepis flexuosa var. tenuifolia, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, dandelion-like yellow flowers arranged in a cluster, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a useful plant for erosion control."
