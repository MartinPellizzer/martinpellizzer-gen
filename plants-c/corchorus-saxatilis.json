    "intro": "Corchorus saxatilis, commonly known as the rock smartweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its capsules contain numerous tiny seeds. Corchorus saxatilis is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
