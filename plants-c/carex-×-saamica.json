It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. This species is typically found in wet or moist environments such as marshes and stream sides. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
