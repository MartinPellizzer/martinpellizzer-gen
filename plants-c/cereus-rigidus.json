    "intro": "Cereus rigidus, commonly known as the rigid candle cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a tall, spiny cactus that can grow up to several meters in height, with a cylindrical stem that is often covered in sharp, white spines. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom at night. Its stem is succulent, allowing it to store water efficiently in its native desert environment. Cereus rigidus is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a hardy plant for xerophytic gardens."
