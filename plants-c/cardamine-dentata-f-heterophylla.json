    "intro": "Cardamine dentata f. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable water crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers with five white petals and numerous yellow stamens, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and is often found in wet meadows, stream margins, and pond edges. This fern-like variant exhibits morphological variation in leaf shape, which contributes to its common name."
