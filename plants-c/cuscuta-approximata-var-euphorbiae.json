    "intro": "Cuscuta approximata var. euphorbiae, commonly known as the parasitic dodder, is a flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow or green flowers and has a rapid growth rate, allowing it to quickly colonize host plants. The plant's structure consists of thin, thread-like stems that wrap around its host, forming a parasitic relationship. It is often found on plants in the genus Euphorbia, which are its primary hosts. This species is widely distributed and can be invasive in certain ecosystems."
