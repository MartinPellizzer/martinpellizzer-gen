    "intro": "Calliandra longipes var. valenzuelensis, commonly known as the Valenzuelan calliandra, is a tropical shrub native to Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery inflorescences that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in clusters. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for ornamental gardening in warm climates. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine, though its primary ornamental value lies in its showy flowers."
