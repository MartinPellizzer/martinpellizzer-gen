    "intro": "Calamus chibehensis, commonly known as the Chibeh reed, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a tall, slender grass-like plant that can grow up to several meters in height, characterized by its long, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers, which are typically followed by spiny fruits. Its rhizomes are often harvested for their aromatic properties and traditional uses in medicine and perfumery. Calamus chibehensis thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near water bodies."
