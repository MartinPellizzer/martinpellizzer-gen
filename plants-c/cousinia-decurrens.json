    "intro": "Cousinia decurrens, commonly known as the creeping globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, globular inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. Cousinia decurrens is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
