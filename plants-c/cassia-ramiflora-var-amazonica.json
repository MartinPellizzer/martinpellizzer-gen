    "intro": "Cassia ramiflora var. amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its showy, bright yellow inflorescences that resemble flame-like clusters, which bloom throughout the dry season. The plant has pinnate leaves composed of several elliptical leaflets, and its bark is smooth and often fissured. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its vibrant floral displays."
