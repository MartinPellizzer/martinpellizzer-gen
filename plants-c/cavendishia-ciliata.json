    "intro": "Cavendishia ciliata, commonly known as the velvetleaf orchid, is a tropical plant native to South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, velvety green leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a yellow throat. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cavendishia ciliata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
