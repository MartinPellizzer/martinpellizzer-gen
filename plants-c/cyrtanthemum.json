    "intro": "Cyrtanthemum, commonly known as the rain lily, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in spring and are often trumpet-shaped. The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and the plants are generally low-growing with a fibrous root system. Cyrtanthemum species are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and floral arrangements. They prefer well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
