It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of many grass species. It is often found in moist, temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its delicate structure, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
