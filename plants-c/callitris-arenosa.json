    "intro": "Callitris arenosa, commonly known as the coastal white cypress, is a resilient evergreen conifer native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and dense, scale-like foliage that provides shade and habitat for various wildlife. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought and salt spray, making it a hardy species in coastal environments. Its ecological importance lies in its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion in harsh, coastal habitats."
