    "intro": "Chaenactis mexicana, commonly known as Mexican frostflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces delicate, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky soils and arid environments, often found in desert or mountainous regions. Its foliage is typically covered in fine, silvery hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat."
