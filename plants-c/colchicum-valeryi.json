    "intro": "Colchicum valeryi, commonly known as the Valerian colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the Colchicaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features a bulbous corm, which serves as its storage organ and allows it to survive harsh winters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and basal, while the flowers are typically purple or pink, with six petals. Colchicum valeryi is also noted for its medicinal properties, although its use is limited due to its toxic nature."
