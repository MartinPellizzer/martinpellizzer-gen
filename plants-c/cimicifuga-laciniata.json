    "intro": "Cimicifuga laciniata, commonly known as black cohosh, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features tall, unbranched stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, adorned with palmate leaves that have a distinctive, deeply lobed appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are followed by red berries that contain seeds. Its roots and rhizomes are the primary parts used in traditional and modern herbal medicine. Cimicifuga laciniata thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in rich, well-drained soils."
