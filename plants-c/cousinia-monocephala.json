    "intro": "Cousinia monocephala, commonly known as the single-headed cudweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and silver-gray foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bristly, seed-filled heads. Cousinia monocephala is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its resilience in harsh environments."
