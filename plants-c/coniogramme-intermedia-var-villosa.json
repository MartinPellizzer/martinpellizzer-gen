    "intro": "Coniogramme intermedia var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy coniogramme, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The varietal name \"villosa\" refers to the hairy texture of its leaves, which is a distinguishing feature of this variety."
