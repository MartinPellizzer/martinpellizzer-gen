    "intro": "Clusia cuneifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf poinsettia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped, with a glossy green surface. The plant produces showy bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves, and it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. It thrives in warm, humid climates and prefers well-drained soil. Clusia cuneifolia is also known for its ability to tolerate shade and is commonly used in landscaping and as a houseplant."
