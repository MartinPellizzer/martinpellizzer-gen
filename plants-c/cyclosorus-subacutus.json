    "intro": "Cyclosorus subacutus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water clover, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into four lobes, resembling a cloverleaf shape. This plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its rhizomes are submerged, allowing it to anchor itself in the sediment. Cyclosorus subacutus plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
