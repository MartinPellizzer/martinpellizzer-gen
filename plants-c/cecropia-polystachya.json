It is characterized by its large, buttressed roots and smooth, grayish-brown bark that often peels in thin layers. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and produces small, clustered white flowers followed by woody, three-angled fruits. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed or degraded habitats. The plant plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
