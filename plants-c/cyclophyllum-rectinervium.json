Its leaves are typically elongated with a prominent, straight midrib and secondary veins that run parallel to it. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often pale yellow or greenish in color. It is native to specific tropical regions and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rare occurrence, it is of interest to botanists studying plant evolution and adaptation."
