    "intro": "Cyperus coronarius, commonly known as the crowned sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Africa, particularly South Africa. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae, though it is often classified under the sedge family Cyperaceae. The plant features upright, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. Its flowering spikes are typically composed of small, greenish-brown flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like formations. Cyperus coronarius is often found in wet or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
