    "intro": "Camissonia pubens, commonly known as the stickyleaf sandwort, is a low-growing annual plant native to western North America. It typically features slender, branched stems covered in small, glandular hairs that give it a sticky texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in dense, elongated inflorescences. Its leaves are usually narrow and may be hairy, adapting to its often arid or rocky habitats. Camissonia pubens is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in disturbed or open environments."
