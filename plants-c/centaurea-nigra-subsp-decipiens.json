    "intro": "Centaurea nigra subsp. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive night-centaury, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features slender, branched stems that grow up to 60 cm tall, often with a reddish tinge. The plant produces striking dark purple to black flowers, which are surrounded by pale blue to white ray florets, creating a visually deceptive appearance. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and slightly hairy, often with a bluish-green hue. This subspecies is adapted to dry, sunny habitats and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
