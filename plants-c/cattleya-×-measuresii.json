    "intro": "Cattleya \u00d7 measuresii, commonly known as the Green Goddess Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid prized for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms. It originates from a cross between Cattleya mossiae and Cattleya bicolor, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The plant typically produces large, waxy flowers in shades of green, yellow, and white, often with a striking contrast between the petals and the sepals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is popular among growers for its elegance and relatively easy care requirements."
