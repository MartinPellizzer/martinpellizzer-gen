    "intro": "Cyperus pungens var. elatus, commonly known as the sword rush, is a perennial wetland plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features tall, slender leaves that are often used in floral arrangements due to their elegant appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist soil and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Its rapid growth makes it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats."
