    "intro": "Cardamine rostrata, commonly known as the rostrate watercress, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a slightly succulent texture and a peppery aroma. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and arranged in a raceme, producing tiny, edible seeds. Cardamine rostrata is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its use in traditional herbal medicine."
