    "intro": "Cladomyza dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are small, white, and fragrant, often blooming in clusters. Due to its habitat specificity and declining natural environment, Cladomyza dubia is considered endangered and is often cultivated in conservation programs."
