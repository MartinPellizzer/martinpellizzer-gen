    "intro": "Ceropegia elegans var. gardneri, commonly known as the String of Hearts, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features trailing stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive hooded structure. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
