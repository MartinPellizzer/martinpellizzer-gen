    "intro": "Carelia conferta, commonly known as the woolly carelia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, pale yellow to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments, such as forest understories. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white to grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Carelia conferta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
