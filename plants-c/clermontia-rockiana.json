    "intro": "Clermontia rockiana, commonly known as the rock cliff heather, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, contributing to its ability to retain moisture in its native habitat. Clermontia rockiana is also notable for its role in the unique flora of Hawaii, where it is considered a rare and endemic species."
