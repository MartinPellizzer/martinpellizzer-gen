    "intro": "Cremolobus suffruticosus, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is a shrub-like perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the rainy season. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. Cremolobus suffruticosus plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals in its native habitat."
