    "intro": "Cereus erythrocephalus, commonly known as the red-headed candleplant, is a cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces striking red flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. It requires minimal water and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
