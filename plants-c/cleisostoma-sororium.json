    "intro": "Cleisostoma sororium, commonly known as the Orchid of the Moon, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom at night. The plant has slender, erect stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Cleisostoma sororium is considered a conservation concern."
