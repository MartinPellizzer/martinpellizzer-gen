    "intro": "Crotalaria muenzneri, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its distinctive yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical seed pods that split open when mature. It is often found in grassland habitats and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Crotalaria muenzneri is also noted for its role in promoting seed germination in native grasses by releasing chemicals that inhibit the growth of other plants."
