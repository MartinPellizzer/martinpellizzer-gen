    "intro": "Campanula adpressa, commonly known as the dwarf bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe. It produces small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Campanula adpressa is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
