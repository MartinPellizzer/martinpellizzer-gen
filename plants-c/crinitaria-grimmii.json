    "intro": "Crinitaria grimmii, commonly known as the hairy lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy appearance, which is due to the presence of long, branched rhizines on its upper surface. This lichen typically grows on tree bark, stones, or soil in temperate and subtropical regions. It is a foliose lichen, meaning it has a leaf-like structure with a distinct upper and lower surface. Crinitaria grimmii is often found in shaded, moist environments and is used in ecological studies to monitor air quality."
