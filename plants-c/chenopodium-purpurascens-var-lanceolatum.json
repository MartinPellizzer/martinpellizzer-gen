It features lanceolate leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in poor, sandy environments. Its adaptability makes it a common weed in agricultural areas."
