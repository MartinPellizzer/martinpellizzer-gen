    "intro": "Carex marina var. tundrarum, commonly known as tundra sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and wetland habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in its cold environment. Its morphology is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions, including strong winds and low temperatures."
