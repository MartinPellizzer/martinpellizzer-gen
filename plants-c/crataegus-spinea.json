    "intro": "Crataegus spinea, commonly known as the prickly hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches and oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, white flowers in spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits called pomes. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping and for erosion control."
