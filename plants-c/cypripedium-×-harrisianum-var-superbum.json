    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 harrisianum var. superbum, commonly known as the giant lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is used to trap pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats, often in rich, organic soil. It has a rhizomatous root system and produces showy, fragrant blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
