    "intro": "Carex galactolepis, commonly known as the yellow sedges, is a species of sedge native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically bright yellow to green in color. The plant produces small, three-bracted inflorescences that are usually green to yellowish in hue. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Carex galactolepis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
