    "intro": "Clerodendrum myricoides f. lanceolatilobatum, commonly known as the lanceolate-lobed clerodendrum, is a variant of the clerodendrum species native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves with distinct lobes, which give it a striking appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color. These flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, particularly bees and butterflies. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and showy blooms."
