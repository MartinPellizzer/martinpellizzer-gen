    "intro": "Costus zechii, commonly known as the Zech's costus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes ginger and turmeric, and is characterized by its aromatic, tubular flowers. The plant produces clusters of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps in moist, well-drained soils. Costus zechii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in some cultures."
