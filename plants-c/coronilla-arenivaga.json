    "intro": "Coronilla arenivaga, commonly known as the sand crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to Mediterranean regions and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
