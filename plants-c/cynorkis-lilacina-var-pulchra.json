    "intro": "Cynorkis lilacina var. pulchra, commonly known as the purple orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its vibrant purple and lilac-colored flowers, which bloom in clusters and emit a subtle fragrance. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy texture, adapting to its moist, forest-floor habitat. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
