    "intro": "Carex praecox var. distans, commonly known as the early sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, pond edges, and riparian zones. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. The flowering stems bear small, three-parted flowers that are often wind-pollinated."
