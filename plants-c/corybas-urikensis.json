    "intro": "Corybas urikensis, commonly known as the New Zealand ghost orchid, is a rare and unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is endemic to New Zealand, primarily found in the North Island, and is known for its striking, hooded flower that resembles a ghostly face. The plant is a terrestrial orchid with a short, thick rhizome and a single, fleshy leaf. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a dark central stripe, and they bloom during late winter to early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation-dependent species."
