    "intro": "Celmisia marginata, commonly known as the silver fern, is a striking New Zealand native plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its unique, fern-like foliage with silver-white veins contrasting against dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is a popular subject in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
