    "intro": "Camellia iniquicarpa, commonly known as the irregular-fruited camellia, is a rare evergreen shrub native to southern China. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and striking, camellia-like flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant produces unique, elongated fruits that are often twisted or irregular in shape, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental beauty. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in the wild."
