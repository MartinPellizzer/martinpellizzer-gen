    "intro": "Centinodia humifusa, commonly known as the groundsel or false dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically features basal leaves that are oblanceolate to elliptic in shape, with a hairy surface and a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and rocky areas. Centinodia humifusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
