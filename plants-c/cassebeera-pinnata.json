    "intro": "Cassebeera pinnata, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the coastal regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy roots that help stabilize shorelines and prevent erosion. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that are pollinated by insects and birds. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by water. Cassebeera pinnata plays a vital role in mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
