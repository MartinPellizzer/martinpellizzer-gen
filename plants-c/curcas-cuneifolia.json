    "intro": "Curcas cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf chenopod, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in width. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by dry, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and can thrive in poor soils. Curcas cuneifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
