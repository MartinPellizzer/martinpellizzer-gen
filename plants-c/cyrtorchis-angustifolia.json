    "intro": "Cyrtorchis angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive spurred lip. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its specialized root system that aids in nutrient absorption. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
