    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas sedge, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Carex genus in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wetlands, and is native to regions in Europe and western Asia. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Carex \u00d7 cuatrecasasii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
