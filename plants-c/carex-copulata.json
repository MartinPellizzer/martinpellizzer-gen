    "intro": "Carex copulata, commonly known as the common sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like stems and dense clusters of spikelets. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. Carex copulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
