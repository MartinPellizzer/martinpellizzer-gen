    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia subsp. euxina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its distinctive bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are rounded and often covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, colorful blooms."
