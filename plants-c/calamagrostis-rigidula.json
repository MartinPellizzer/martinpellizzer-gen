    "intro": "Calamagrostis rigidula, commonly known as stiff reed grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to wet soils. The plant features tall, stiff, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are often pinkish or purplish in color. Calamagrostis rigidula is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
