    "intro": "Couroupita membranacea, commonly known as the red mangrove or *Rhizophora membranacea*, is a tropical tree native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive red bark and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. The plant has prop roots that help stabilize the soil and facilitate gas exchange in the waterlogged environment. Its flowers are small and yellow, typically appearing in clusters, and it produces woody fruits containing seeds. This species plays an important ecological role in mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to coastal protection."
