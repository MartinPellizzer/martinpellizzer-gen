    "intro": "Cinchona scrobiculata, commonly known as the rough bark cinchona, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and compound leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers and red berries, which are typical of the genus Cinchona. It is also noted for its medicinal properties, particularly due to the presence of quinine, though its use in modern medicine is limited. This species plays an important role in both ecological and historical contexts."
