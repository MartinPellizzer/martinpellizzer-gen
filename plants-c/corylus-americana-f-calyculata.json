    "intro": "Corylus americana f. calyculata, commonly known as the dwarf hazelnut, is a compact, shrub-like form of the American hazelnut. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and the production of edible, nut-like seeds. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sun. Its botanical features include a distinctive calyx that persists on the nut, giving it its specific epithet. This form is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its dense, bushy growth habit."
