    "intro": "Corytoplectus speciosus, commonly known as the ornate sand dollar, is a species of sea urchin found in shallow coastal waters. It belongs to the family Toxopneustidae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, globular body covered in a calcareous test. The animal's surface is often adorned with intricate patterns and colors, which provide camouflage against the seafloor. It feeds primarily on detritus and small organisms, playing a role in nutrient cycling in marine ecosystems. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest for marine biologists and conservationists."
