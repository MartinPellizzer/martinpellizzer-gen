    "intro": "Commiphora kerstingii, commonly known as the Kersting's myrrh, is a small, deciduous shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and small, elliptical leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, followed by fragrant, resinous sap that has been historically used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. Due to its unique properties and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable but rare species in botanical studies."
