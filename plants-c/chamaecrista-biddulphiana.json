    "intro": "Chamaecrista biddulphiana, commonly known as the Biddulph's sensitiveplant, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers. The plant is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Due to its sensitivity to touch, the leaves often fold shut when disturbed, a trait that gives it its common name."
