It features slender, upright stems that are densely covered with a sticky, resinous substance, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and resilience."
