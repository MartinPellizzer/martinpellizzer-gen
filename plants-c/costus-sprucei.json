    "intro": "Costus sprucei, commonly known as the white costus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Costaceae and is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and showy, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value comes from its striking inflorescences, which resemble plumes, and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Costus sprucei is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature."
