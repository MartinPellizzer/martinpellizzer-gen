    "intro": "Cuscuta epispartos, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique strategy of wrapping itself around its host to access its vascular system. The plant's stems are slender and thread-like, allowing it to spread easily across the host's surface. It is found in various regions, including North America, and can infest a wide range of agricultural and wild plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken or even kill its host plants."
