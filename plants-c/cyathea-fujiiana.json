    "intro": "Cyathea fujiiana, commonly known as the Fuji Island tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant exhibits a unique growth pattern, with a central trunk that remains unbranched and covered in a layer of dead fronds. Its fronds are bi-directionally arranged, with the upper portion being sterile and the lower portion bearing spore-producing structures. Cyathea fujiiana is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded, moist environments."
