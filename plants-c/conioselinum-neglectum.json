    "intro": "Conioselinum neglectum, commonly known as the slender wormwood, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in umbels. Native to southern Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. It has a strong, aromatic scent and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in some regions but is also valued for its ornamental qualities."
