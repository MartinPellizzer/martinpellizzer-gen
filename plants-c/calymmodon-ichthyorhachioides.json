It features a branched stem with fleshy, linear leaves that resemble fishbones, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid climates. Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
