    "intro": "Cineraria magnicephala, commonly known as the blue cineraria, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has silvery-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in various parts of the world, though it is often grown as an annual due to its sensitivity to frost."
