    "intro": "Cinnamomum zeylanicum var. pleei, commonly known as cinnamon leaf or kaffir lime, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, narrow, elongated leaves that are often used in cooking and traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by oval-shaped fruits containing aromatic seeds. Its leaves contain essential oils rich in compounds like limonene and cineol, contributing to its distinctive scent. This variety is closely related to the commercial cinnamon species but is more valued for its aromatic foliage than its bark."
