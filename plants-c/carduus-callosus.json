    "intro": "Carduus callosus, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, gray-green leaves covered in dense, woolly hairs. The plant produces purple to violet flower heads that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
