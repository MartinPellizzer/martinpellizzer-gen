    "intro": "Ctenitis pedicellata, commonly known as the veined tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have a complex, layered structure with multiple pinnae. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
