It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and consists of several species that are often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plants are characterized by their showy, yellow or orange flowers that resemble stars, which attract various pollinators. Cansenia species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, and they have narrow, lance-shaped leaves. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their vibrant floral displays."
