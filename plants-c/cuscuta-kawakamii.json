    "intro": "Cuscuta kawakamii, commonly known as the Japanese dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to East Asia and is often found growing on various herbaceous plants. Its life cycle involves germinating on a host and forming specialized structures called haustoria to extract water and nutrients. Cuscuta kawakamii is an example of a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it can photosynthesize to a limited extent but primarily depends on its host for survival."
