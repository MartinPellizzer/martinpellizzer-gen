    "intro": "Cheiridopsis subalba, commonly known as the white-knuckled ice plant, is a succulent native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
