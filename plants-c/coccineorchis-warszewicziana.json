    "intro": "Coccineorchis warszewicziana, commonly known as the Warszewicz's red orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red flowers, which are typically adorned with intricate patterns and a distinctive lip. The plant grows in rocky or forested habitats, often at high altitudes where it faces harsh environmental conditions. Its botanical features include long, slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to conserve moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
