    "intro": "Caraguata, commonly known as *Begonia pavonina*, is a tropical flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that often display a mix of green, red, and purple hues. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, which bloom throughout the growing season. Caraguata thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and shaded garden beds."
