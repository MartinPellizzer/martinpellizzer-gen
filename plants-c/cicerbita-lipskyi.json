    "intro": "Cicerbita lipskyi, commonly known as the Lepsky's celandine, is a flowering plant native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae, which includes poppies and other related species. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lobed leaves and produces yellowish-orange flowers with prominent, saucer-shaped petals. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
