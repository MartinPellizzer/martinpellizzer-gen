    "intro": "Cynanchica tenella, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the milkweed genus. Its latex contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Cynanchica tenella is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
