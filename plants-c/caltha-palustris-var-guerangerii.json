    "intro": "Caltha palustris var. guerangerii, commonly known as the Gueranger's water buttercup, is a variant of the water buttercup native to wetland habitats in Europe. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in shallow, nutrient-rich waters or moist soils. The plant features bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its leaves are arrow-shaped and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its aquatic environment. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting wetland biodiversity."
