It is characterized by its striking red, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and twining stems that climb or trail along the ground. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardens, though it can become invasive in some regions."
