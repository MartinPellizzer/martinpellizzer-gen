    "intro": "Crepis lanceolata var. platyphylla, commonly known as the broadleaf mouse-ear, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features basal rosettes of broad, spoon-shaped leaves that are hairy and often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in loose clusters, typically blooming from June to August. It prefers well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade and is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. This variant is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical form of Crepis lanceolata."
