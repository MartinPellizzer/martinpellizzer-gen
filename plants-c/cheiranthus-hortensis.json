    "intro": "Cheiranthus hortensis, commonly known as the garden mustard, is an annual flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds, which are often used as a spice in culinary applications. Native to Europe, it thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to self-seed make it both a common weed and a valuable garden plant."
