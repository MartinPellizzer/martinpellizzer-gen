    "intro": "Cecropia strigosa, commonly known as the roughleaf ceiba, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves with a rough, hairy texture on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests. Cecropia strigosa plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
