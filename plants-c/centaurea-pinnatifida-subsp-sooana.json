    "intro": "Centaurea pinnatifida subsp. sooana, commonly known as the Sicilian thistle, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking purple to pink flower heads, which are surrounded by narrow, spiny bracts. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Its leaves are pinnately divided, giving it a feathery appearance, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been introduced to other parts of the world for gardening purposes."
