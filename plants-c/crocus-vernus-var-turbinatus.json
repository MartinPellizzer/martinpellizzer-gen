    "intro": "Crocus vernus var. turbinatus, commonly known as the turban crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It produces showy, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive, turban-like shape, which gives it its common name. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before many other spring flowers, making it a notable early-flowering species. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from a bulbous underground stem. The turban crocus is well-suited for rock gardens and borders, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun."
