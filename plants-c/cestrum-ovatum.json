    "intro": "Cestrum ovatum, commonly known as the night bloomer or sweet shrub, is a deciduous shrub native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Cestrum ovatum is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and pleasant fragrance."
