    "intro": "Carduus acaulescens, commonly known as the naked stem thistle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its lack of a distinct stem, with the leaves directly arising from the base of the plant. The plant produces spiny, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in dry, disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
