    "intro": "Cynanchica tephrocarpa, commonly known as the ash-colored milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by follicles containing toxic, milky sap. Its root system is deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Due to its chemical composition, it is often avoided by herbivores and has limited agricultural or medicinal use."
