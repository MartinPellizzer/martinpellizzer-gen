    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 subdecolorans, commonly known as the pale sedge, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Carex genus in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, strap-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. This species is often found in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. The plant is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
