    "intro": "Calophyllum dryobalanoides, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, often reddish-brown bark and long, narrow leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, and the tree is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oil. The species is also important in ecological restoration due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
