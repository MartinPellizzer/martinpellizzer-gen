    "intro": "Chylismia claviformis subsp. claviformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved chylismia, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and chaparral. It has a compact growth habit with a rosette of basal leaves and stems that rise from the center. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in arid gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
