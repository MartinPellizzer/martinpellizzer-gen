    "intro": "Comarum palustre, commonly known as marsh woundwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America and Europe. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and stream edges. The plant has slender, upright stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. Comarum palustre is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
