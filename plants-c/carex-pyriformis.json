    "intro": "Carex pyriformis, commonly known as the pear-shaped sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often dark green and slightly glossy. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex pyriformis is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
