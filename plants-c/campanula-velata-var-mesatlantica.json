    "intro": "Campanula velata var. mesatlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the eastern United States. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shores, thriving in moist, well-drained conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in coastal environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize dune ecosystems."
