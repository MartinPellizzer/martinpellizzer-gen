    "intro": "Centromadia pungens var. congdonii, commonly known as the Congo centromadia, is a rare and striking plant native to the dense rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant produces unique, elongated fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss and limited study, it remains a lesser-known but ecologically significant species in its native range."
