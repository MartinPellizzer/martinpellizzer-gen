    "intro": "Crassula pentandra var. obtusifolia, commonly known as the Jade Plant or Crassula ovata, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal, it is a popular houseplant and garden specimen."
