    "intro": "Cephalaria sillingeri, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada cephalaria, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of California. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and leafy structure. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. It produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
