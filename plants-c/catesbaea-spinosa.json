    "intro": "Catesbaea spinosa, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and large, compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into woody pods containing 8\u201324 elliptical seeds, known as Brazil nuts. These seeds are enclosed in a hard, fibrous shell and are commercially valuable for their high oil content. The plant plays a crucial role in the ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
