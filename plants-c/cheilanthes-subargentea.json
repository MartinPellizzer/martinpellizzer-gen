    "intro": "Cheilanthes subargentea, commonly known as the silver-tipped rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and silver-white to grayish-green fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant is adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in low-water environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions. Its fronds are typically divided into narrow segments, and the sporangia are borne on the undersides of the leaves. This fern is often found growing on limestone or granite substrates, where it forms dense, low-growing colonies."
