    "intro": "Cyphokentia vaginata, commonly known as the bottle palm, is a species of cycad native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk that resembles a bottle, hence its common name. The plant produces large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. Cyphokentia vaginata is typically found in lowland rainforests and is adapted to humid, warm climates. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
