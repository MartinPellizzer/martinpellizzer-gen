    "intro": "Castilleja communis, commonly known as the common Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It has reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. The plant relies on other plants for some of its nutrients, forming a symbiotic relationship with the roots of grasses and shrubs. Its leaves are alternate and lance-shaped, and it typically grows in dry, open habitats. Castilleja communis is an important plant in native ecosystems, supporting pollinators and contributing to biodiversity."
