    "intro": "Campanuloides subulata, commonly known as the needleleaf bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually blue or violet in color, often with a white or yellow throat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Due to its delicate appearance and unique morphology, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in botanical gardens."
