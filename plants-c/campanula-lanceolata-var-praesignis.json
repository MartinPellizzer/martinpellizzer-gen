The leaves are lanceolate, with a pointed tip and a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
