    "intro": "Chlorospatha hastifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved greenbark, is a herbaceous plant native to the wet tropical regions of Central and South America. It features lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically a vibrant green, with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its unique leaf structure and rapid growth make it a notable species in its native habitat. However, it is relatively uncommon in cultivation due to its specific environmental requirements."
