    "intro": "Chamaefilix rhizophylla, commonly known as the root-leaved saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of northern Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in the summer, which are clustered in a single inflorescence at the center of the rosette. Its leaves are succulent and adapted to retain moisture in cold, dry environments. Chamaefilix rhizophylla is typically found in rocky soils and is often used as an indicator species for high-altitude or arctic ecosystems."
