It is characterized by its subterranean stem that grows beneath the soil surface, with only the flower emerging above ground. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring. It is adapted to arid environments and has a slow growth rate. Due to its specialized growth form, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
