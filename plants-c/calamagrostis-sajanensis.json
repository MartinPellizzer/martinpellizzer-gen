It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and river valleys. The plant features tall, slender stalks with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers. Calamagrostis sajanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
