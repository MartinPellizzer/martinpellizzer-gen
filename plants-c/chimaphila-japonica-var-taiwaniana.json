    "intro": "Chimaphila japonica var. taiwaniana, commonly known as the Taiwan flame flower, is a rare and endemic species native to Taiwan. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its striking red-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its leaves are elliptical and dark green, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
