    "intro": "Cyathea aurea, commonly known as the golden tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, compound fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The fronds are pinnately divided, with a smooth, waxy surface that gives them a distinctive appearance. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its slow growth rate and unique aesthetic make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and conservation efforts."
