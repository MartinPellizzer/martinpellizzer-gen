    "intro": "Cereus pentlandii var. roseus, commonly known as the roseate night bloomer, is a cactus species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking, large, white flowers that open at night and emit a sweet fragrance. These flowers are typically borne at the base of the stem and are followed by small, red fruits. It requires well-draining soil and minimal water, making it a popular choice for desert gardens."
