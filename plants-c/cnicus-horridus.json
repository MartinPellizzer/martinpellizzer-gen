    "intro": "Cnicus horridus, commonly known as the prickly lettuce, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, bristle-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, allowing it to spread easily in disturbed soils. Cnicus horridus is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas where it can thrive in full sun."
