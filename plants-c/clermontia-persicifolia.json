    "intro": "Clermontia persicifolia, commonly known as the roseleaf clermonthe, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its stems are often reddish in color.
