    "intro": "Crocus boryi subsp. cretensis, commonly known as the Cretan crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern Mediterranean, particularly Greece. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, cup-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
