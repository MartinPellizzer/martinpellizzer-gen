    "intro": "Crataegus palustris, commonly known as the swamp crataegus, is a deciduous shrub native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features thorny branches with alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Its root system helps stabilize soil, making it valuable in wetland restoration projects. The species is adapted to moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along riverbanks."
