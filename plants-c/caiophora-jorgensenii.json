    "intro": "Caiophora jorgensenii, commonly known as the Jorgensen's caiophora, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Araliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. Its botanical features include smooth, often hairy stems and a preference for moist, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
