    "intro": "Cerasus laurocerasus var. pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf cherry laurel, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features dark green, glossy leaves that are elliptical in shape and emit a mild, sweet fragrance. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during early spring, followed by edible, cherry-like berries that are typically red or black. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Due to its slow growth and dense foliage, it is often used as a hedge or foundation plant."
