It is a small to medium-sized tree, typically reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The plant is characterized by its pinnate leaves, which are often used in traditional crafts. Its fruit produces a hard, inedible seed enclosed in a fibrous husk. Copernicia ekmanii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage."
