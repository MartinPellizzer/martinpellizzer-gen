The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, and it has a woody, shrub-like growth habit. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry, arid conditions due to its drought-resistant properties. The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and ornamental gardening."
