It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and fields. The plant has small, blue to purple flower heads that are clustered in a single bloom, giving it its species name \"uniflora.\" Its leaves are hairy and have a distinctive lobed shape, while the stem is usually branched and covered in fine hairs. Conyza uniflora is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
