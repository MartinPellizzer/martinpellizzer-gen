    "intro": "Cistus \u00d7 mesoensis f. albus, commonly known as the white-flowered rockrose, is a hybrid shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaped gardens. Its leaves are covered in fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
