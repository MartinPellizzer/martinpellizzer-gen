    "intro": "Calandrinia acaulis, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual plant with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces vibrant pink to purple flowers that open in the morning and close by midday, adapting to the hot, sunny environment. Its flowers are typically trumpet-shaped with five petals and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. Calandrinia acaulis thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping in dry climates."
