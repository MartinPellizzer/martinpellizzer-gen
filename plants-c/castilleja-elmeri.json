    "intro": "Castilleja elmeri, commonly known as Elmer's paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vivid red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves, which are adapted for parasitic growth on the roots of other plants. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often forming dense colonies. Due to its ecological role and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires careful management to prevent overgrowth."
