    "intro": "Corydalis ambigua lusus pectinata, commonly known as the fringed corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, spurred petals and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a distinctive, hairy texture, and the stems are usually hairy as well. Corydalis ambigua lusus pectinata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated in gardens with partial shade."
