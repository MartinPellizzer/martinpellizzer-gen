    "intro": "Canarium fuscum, commonly known as the black wax tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, waxy leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed enclosed in a hard, woody capsule. Its bark is thick and often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Canarium fuscum is also valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
