    "intro": "Capparis, commonly known as the caper plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Capparaceae. It consists of about 150 species, many of which are shrubs or small trees native to warm temperate and tropical regions. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, often spiny stems and small, yellow or white flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant produces a distinctive, pungent-smelling caper, which is used in culinary applications. Capparis species are often found in coastal areas and can thrive in saline soils."
