    "intro": "Cyperus obtusiflorus var. ledermannii, commonly known as the Ledermann's flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like stems that often grow in dense clusters, with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spikes of tiny, pale green or brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. This variant is distinguished by its broader, more rounded leaves compared to the typical form of Cyperus obtusiflorus."
