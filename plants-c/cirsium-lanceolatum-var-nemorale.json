    "intro": "Cirsium lanceolatum var. nemorale, commonly known as the woodland thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and rocky slopes, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features upright, sparsely hairy stems with large, lance-shaped leaves that are often lobed and have a coarse texture. Its flowers are pale purple to pink, forming dense, spherical clusters at the top of the stems. This variant is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to other members of the Cirsium genus."
