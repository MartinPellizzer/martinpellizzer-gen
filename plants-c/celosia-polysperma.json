It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and vibrant, spiky inflorescences that range in color from red to orange. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense, brush-like structures called cyathia. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and containers. Celosia polysperma is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
