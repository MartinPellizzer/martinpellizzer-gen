    "intro": "Cryptosepalum exfoliatum, commonly known as the peeling-sepal plant, is a unique member of the orchid family with distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its thin, papery leaves that often peel away from the stem, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without being parasitic. Cryptosepalum exfoliatum is native to tropical regions and thrives in humid, shaded environments."
