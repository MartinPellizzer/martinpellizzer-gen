    "intro": "Callitropsis arizonica, commonly known as Arizona cypress, is a species of coniferous evergreen tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, columnar shape and scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its foliage and structure make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping in dry climates."
