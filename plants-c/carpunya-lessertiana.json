    "intro": "Carpunya lessertiana, commonly known as the Lussier's carpunya, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheat and sorrel species. The plant is characterized by its upright stem and clusters of small, delicate white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silky hair, giving them a distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Carpunya lessertiana is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
