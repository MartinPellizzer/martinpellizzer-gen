    "intro": "Calystegia tomentosa, commonly known as the hairy bindweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a sprawling annual vine that produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant has hairy, pubescent stems and leaves that are heart-shaped with a lobed base. Its flowers bloom in summer, and it is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively. The plant is often considered a weed due to its persistent nature and ability to colonize disturbed soils."
