It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange or red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for cultivation in warm climates. Cordia guerkeana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its attractive foliage and fruit."
