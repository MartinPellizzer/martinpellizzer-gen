It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are variable in shape, which gives it its common name, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
