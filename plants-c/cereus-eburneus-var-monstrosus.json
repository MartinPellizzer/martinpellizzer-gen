    "intro": "Cereus eburneus var. monstrosus, commonly known as the Queen of the Night, is a cactus species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems that often bear clusters of large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant has a unique growth habit, with a central stem that produces lateral shoots, giving it a bushy appearance. Its flowers are ephemeral, lasting only a few hours, and are pollinated by moths. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water and reduce transpiration."
