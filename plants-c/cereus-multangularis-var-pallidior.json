    "intro": "Cereus multangularis var. pallidior, commonly known as the pale angel's wings, is a cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that are often covered in white or pale yellow spines. The plant produces large, showy flowers that typically bloom at night, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and indoor cultivation."
