    "intro": "Corallorhiza hortensis, commonly known as the garden coralroot, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is notable for its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph. It relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients, forming a symbiotic relationship with various mycorrhizal fungi. The plant produces small, reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with hardwood trees. Due to its specialized growth requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
