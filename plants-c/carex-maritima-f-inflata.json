    "intro": "Carex maritima f. inflata, commonly known as the inflated sedge, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and specialized reproductive structures. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear spikelets with bract-like structures, and its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in dunes or tidal areas. The inflorescence of this plant is notable for its inflated, boat-shaped bracts, which give it its common name."
