    "intro": "Croton solanifolius, commonly known as the nightshade-leaved croton, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that resemble those of nightshade plants, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some regions for its unique foliage."
