    "intro": "Cornus stolonifera var. interior, commonly known as the interior dogwood, is a shrub native to the northeastern United States. It features showy white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by red or purple berries in the fall. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and it produces stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food and shelter for wildlife."
