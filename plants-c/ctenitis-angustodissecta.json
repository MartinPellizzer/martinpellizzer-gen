    "intro": "Ctenitis angustodissecta, commonly known as the narrow-lobed tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, compound fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The fronds are pinnately divided, with narrow, elongated segments that contribute to its ornamental value. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and as a decorative plant in tropical landscapes."
