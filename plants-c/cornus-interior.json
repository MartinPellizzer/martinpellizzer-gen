    "intro": "Cornus interior, commonly known as the interior dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its showy white bracts that surround small, yellowish flowers, which appear in late spring. The plant produces bright red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface. Cornus interior thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
