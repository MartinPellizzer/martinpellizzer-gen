    "intro": "Colymbada \u00d7 losana, commonly known as the hybrid water lily, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between *Colymboda crenata* and *Nymphaea tetragona*. It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves that float on the water surface, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces large, showy flowers that can be white, pink, or red, typically opening in the morning and closing at dusk. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes, where it can form dense colonies. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in aquatic gardens and water features worldwide."
