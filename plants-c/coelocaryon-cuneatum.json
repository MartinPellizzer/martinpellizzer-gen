It has broad, floating leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, aiding in water repellence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the day. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow water bodies. Coelocaryon cuneatum plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various water organisms."
