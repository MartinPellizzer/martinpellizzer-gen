    "intro": "Convolvulus malacophyllus subsp. pedicellatus, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, showy flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are slender and often hairy. This species thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
