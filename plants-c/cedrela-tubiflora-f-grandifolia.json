    "intro": "Cedrela tubiflora f. grandifolia, commonly known as the grandiflora cedar, is a tropical tree species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and long, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and timber potential, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and reforestation projects."
