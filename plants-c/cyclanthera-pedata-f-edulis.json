    "intro": "Cyclanthera pedata f. edulis, commonly known as the edible bitter gourd, is a variant of the bitter gourd species native to tropical regions. It is a climbing vine that produces long, pointed fruits with a bitter taste, which is reduced through selective breeding. The plant belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other cucurbits like cucumbers and melons. Its leaves are lobed and have a rough texture, while the stems are hairy and tend to climb using tendrils. This variety is valued for its edible fruits, which are commonly used in Asian cuisines after being cooked to reduce bitterness."
