    "intro": "Centaurella autumnalis, commonly known as autumn centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant produces achene fruits, which are dry, indehiscent seeds enclosed in a pappus, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are typically linear to lanceolate, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss. Centaurella autumnalis thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and coastal areas."
