    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. acuminata, commonly known as the sharp-lobed hazel, is a variant of the common hazel native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, acutely pointed leaves that give it its botanical name. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by edible hazelnuts in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or hedgerows. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its ecological importance to wildlife."
