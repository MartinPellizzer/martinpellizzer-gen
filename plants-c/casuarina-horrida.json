    "intro": "Casuarina horrida, commonly known as the rough casuarina, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals around the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Casuarina horrida thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often growing in dunes or along the shoreline. It is well adapted to salty air and can tolerate drought conditions."
