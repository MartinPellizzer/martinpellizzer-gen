    "intro": "Clematis brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed clematis, is a climbing vine native to parts of Asia, particularly China and Japan. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters, with palmately divided leaves that are hairy on the underside. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, are borne in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Clematis brevipes prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for gardeners looking to add ornamental value to their landscapes."
