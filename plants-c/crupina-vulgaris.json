It is characterized by its spiny, leaf-like bracts and blue to purple flower heads that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils, often found in dunes and along shorelines. Its salt tolerance makes it a common species in maritime environments. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and thistles."
