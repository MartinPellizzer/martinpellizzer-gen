    "intro": "Cremanthodium principis, commonly known as the royal cremanthodium, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Pyrenees Mountains. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in meadows and slopes at elevations above 2,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
