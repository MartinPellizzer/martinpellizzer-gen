It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in white or pale blue spines. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, usually in shades of white or pale yellow. These flowers are followed by small, red fruits that contain edible seeds. Cephalocereus bradei is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
