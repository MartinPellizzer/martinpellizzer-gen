    "intro": "Cyathocoma, commonly known as the star-shaped flower plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of a cup-like structure called a cyathium, housing both male and female flowers. The leaves are typically alternate and often have a rough or hairy texture. Cyathocoma species are native to regions in Africa and are often found in arid or semi-arid environments. These plants are known for their ornamental value due to their striking, star-like flowers."
