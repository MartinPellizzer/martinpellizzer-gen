    "intro": "Carex secalina var. alpina, commonly known as the Alpine basket sedge, is a perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in rocky or mountainous habitats. It has narrow, strap-shaped leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments."
