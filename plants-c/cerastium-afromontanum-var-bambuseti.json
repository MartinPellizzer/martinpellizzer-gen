    "intro": "Cerastium afromontanum var. bambuseti, commonly known as the African mountain chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. The plant has delicate, hairy leaves and stems, adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and forest margins, where it contributes to the biodiversity of these ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
