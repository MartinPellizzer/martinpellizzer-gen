    "intro": "Coffea bertrandii, commonly known as the Bertrand's coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in countries like Brazil and Peru. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds used for coffee. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Coffea bertrandii is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated species."
