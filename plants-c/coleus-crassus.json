    "intro": "Coleus crassus, commonly known as the thick-leaved coleus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that can range in color from deep green to maroon and even purple. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Coleus crassus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant foliage and ease of care."
