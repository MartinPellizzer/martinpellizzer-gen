    "intro": "Croton verreauxii var. longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved croton, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, elongated leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length, often with a vibrant green or variegated coloration. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange or red berries, which are attractive to birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for tropical gardens and indoor spaces."
