    "intro": "Combretum edwardsii, commonly known as the yellow flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that appear in clusters, often resembling flames, which bloom during the dry season. The plant has opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds."
