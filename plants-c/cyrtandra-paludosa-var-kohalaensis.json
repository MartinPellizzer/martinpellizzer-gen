    "intro": "Cyrtandra paludosa var. kohalaensis, commonly known as the Kohala mountain heliotrope, is a rare endemic plant found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of Hawaii's Kohala Mountains. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of violet and white. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in rocky or mossy areas. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving Hawaii's unique flora."
