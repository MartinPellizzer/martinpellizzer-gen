    "intro": "Cleopatra, commonly known as the Egyptian fig, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It produces small, edible figs that are typically green when unripe and turn purple or black when mature. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, fragrant white flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Cleopatra is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of fresh fruit."
