    "intro": "Cybianthus flavovirens, commonly known as the yellow-green cybianthus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. Cybianthus flavovirens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
