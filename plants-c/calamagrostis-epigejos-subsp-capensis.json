It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as riverbanks and marshy areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with a temperate climate."
