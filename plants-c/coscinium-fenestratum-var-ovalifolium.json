    "intro": "Coscinium fenestratum var. ovalifolium, commonly known as the oval-leaved black woodbine, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that are often perforated or fenestrated, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, followed by black, berry-like fruits. Its stems are woody and twining, allowing it to climb and spread through dense vegetation. The species is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though its toxicity requires caution in use."
