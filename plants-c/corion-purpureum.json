    "intro": "Corion purpureum, commonly known as the purple coralroot, is an orchid species native to the eastern United States. It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies on fungal networks for nutrients. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of purple and pink, often with intricate patterns. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, which provide essential carbohydrates. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in many areas, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
