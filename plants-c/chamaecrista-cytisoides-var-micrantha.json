    "intro": "Chamaecrista cytisoides var. micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burr legume, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces distinctive, spiny pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
