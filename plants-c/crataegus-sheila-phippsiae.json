    "intro": "Crataegus sheila-phippsiae, commonly known as Sheila Phipps hawthorn, is a rare and endemic species native to the United Kingdom. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, thorned branches and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that ripen in the autumn, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation priority."
