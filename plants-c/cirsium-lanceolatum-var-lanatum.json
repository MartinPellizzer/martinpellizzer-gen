    "intro": "Cirsium lanceolatum var. lanatum, commonly known as the downy thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and large, purple to pinkish flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped, deeply lobed leaves covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist to wet soils in woodland or marshy areas, often forming dense colonies. The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
