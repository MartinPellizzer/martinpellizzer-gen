    "intro": "Chelonopsis odontochila subsp. forrestii, commonly known as the Forest's chelonopsis, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring elongated, leathery leaves with a distinct venation pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous or forested areas. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with a pale or greenish hue, adapted for specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
