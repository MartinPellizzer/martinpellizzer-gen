    "intro": "Chamaecrista cercidifolia, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is typically found in sandy or rocky soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It has a low-growing habit with creeping stems that can form dense mats, making it well adapted to harsh conditions. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
