    "intro": "Campanula scheuchzeri var. susplugasii, commonly known as the Susplugasii bellflower, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh mountain environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
