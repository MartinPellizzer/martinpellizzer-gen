    "intro": "Carex hirta var. glabra, commonly known as smooth marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and moist environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers. Its smooth, glabrous leaves distinguish it from other Carex species, and it thrives in poorly drained soils. This plant plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
