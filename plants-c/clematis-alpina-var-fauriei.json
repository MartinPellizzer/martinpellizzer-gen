    "intro": "Clematis alpina var. fauriei, commonly known as the alpine clematis, is a perennial vine native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it adapts to harsh, cold climates. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
