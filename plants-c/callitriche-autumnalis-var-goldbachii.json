    "intro": "Callitriche autumnalis var. goldbachii, commonly known as golden water-star, is a small aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged, with small white flowers that appear in late summer. It is characterized by its delicate appearance and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction. This variety is often found in nutrient-rich waters and can serve as an indicator of water quality."
