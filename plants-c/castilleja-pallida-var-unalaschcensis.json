    "intro": "Castilleja pallida var. unalaschcensis, commonly known as the Unalaska milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Aleutian Islands of Alaska. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces bright red or orange tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is adapted to the harsh coastal climate. Its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements make it a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
