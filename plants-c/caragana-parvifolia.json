    "intro": "Caragana parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf shrub willow or small-leaved caragana, is a deciduous shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, woody pods containing several seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in poor soil and limited water conditions. Caragana parvifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize soil in difficult terrain."
