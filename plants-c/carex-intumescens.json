    "intro": "Carex intumescens, commonly known as the swollen sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant has triangular stems and produces spikes of small, greenish flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to help retain moisture. Carex intumescens is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
