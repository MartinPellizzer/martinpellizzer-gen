    "intro": "Cochemiea barbata, commonly known as the hairy cochemiea, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of white, woolly bristles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often borne on short, thick stems. It is a drought-tolerant species that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Cochemiea barbata is prized in xeriscaping for its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements."
