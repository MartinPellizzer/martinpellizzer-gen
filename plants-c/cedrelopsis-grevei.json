    "intro": "Cedrelopsis grevei, commonly known as the African cedar, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna woodlands. Due to its slow growth and limited natural range, it is considered a vulnerable species."
