    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 halophila subsp. acutangula, commonly known as the sharp-leaved sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known for their ecological importance in water filtration and soil stabilization. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically sharp and pointed, with a dark green coloration. It produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often wind-pollinated, and it thrives in saturated or seasonally flooded soils. This subspecies is particularly adapted to coastal and brackish environments, making it a valuable component of salt-tolerant vegetation."
