    "intro": "Chamaecyparis pisifera f. standishii, commonly known as the Japanese white cedar or Standishii cedar, is a unique horticultural form of the Japanese cypress. It is characterized by its striking white to silver-blue foliage, which contrasts beautifully with its dark green needles. This variety is a compact, slow-growing evergreen that forms a dense, conical shape. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces. Its ornamental value lies in its color contrast and elegant, pyramidal form."
