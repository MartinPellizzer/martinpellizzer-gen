    "intro": "Cistus \u00d7 stenophyllus var. maculatus, commonly known as the spotted rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Its leaves are typically covered in a white, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The varietal name 'maculatus' refers to the distinctive spotted or mottled appearance of its foliage."
