    "intro": "Campanula coronata, commonly known as the crown bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
