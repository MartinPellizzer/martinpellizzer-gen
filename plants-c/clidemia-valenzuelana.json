It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or white, with a prominent yellow center. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in understory habitats of tropical forests. Clidemia valenzuelana is also known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it a potential invasive species in some regions."
