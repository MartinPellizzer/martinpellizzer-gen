    "intro": "Ceratophyllum echinatum, commonly known as the spiked hornwort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and small, spiny leaves that give it its scientific name. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its leaves, making it an effective oxygenator in ponds and lakes. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters with moderate to high light exposure. Ceratophyllum echinatum is often used in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
