    "intro": "Cactus lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico and the southwestern United States. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a cylindrical stem that often branches at the base. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Cactus lehmannii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
