    "intro": "Carludovica scandens, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a climbing shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often used as a ground cover or ornamental plant. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it both useful and sometimes invasive in certain environments."
