    "intro": "Campanula persicifolia var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance. The variety lasiocarpa is distinguished by its dense, woolly pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments."
