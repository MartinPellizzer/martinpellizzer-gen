    "intro": "Colymbada acicularis, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches, where it can anchor itself to substrates. Its leaves are slender and often spiral around the stem, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Colymbada acicularis is a carnivorous plant, relying on its bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters."
