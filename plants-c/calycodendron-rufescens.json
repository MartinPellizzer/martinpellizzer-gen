    "intro": "Calycodendron rufescens, commonly known as the red-leaf tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate and have a distinctive reddish hue, especially during the dry season. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in its natural wild state."
