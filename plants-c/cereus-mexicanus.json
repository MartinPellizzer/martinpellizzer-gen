    "intro": "Cereus mexicanus, commonly known as the night bloomer cactus, is a species native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a spineless cactus with a tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to 10 feet in height. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. Its stems are covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Cereus mexicanus is well adapted to desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and thriving in full sun."
