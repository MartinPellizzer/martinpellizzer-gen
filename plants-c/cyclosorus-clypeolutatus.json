    "intro": "Cyclosorus clypeolutatus, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged rocks or vegetation. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. The species is notable for its delicate appearance and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
