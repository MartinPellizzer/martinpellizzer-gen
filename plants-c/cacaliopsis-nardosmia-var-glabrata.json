    "intro": "Cacaliopsis nardosmia var. glabrata, commonly known as the glabrous cacaliopsis, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in umbels, a common feature in the Apiaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
