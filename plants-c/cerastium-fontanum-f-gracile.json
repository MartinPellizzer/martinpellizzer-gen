    "intro": "Cerastium fontanum f. gracile, commonly known as the slender mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. Native to Europe, this plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its compact form and delicate appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland gardens. The species is also noted for its ability to spread via stolons, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion."
