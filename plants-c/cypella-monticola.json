    "intro": "Cypella monticola, commonly known as the mountain cypella, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. However, it is relatively rare and faces threats from habitat loss and climate change."
