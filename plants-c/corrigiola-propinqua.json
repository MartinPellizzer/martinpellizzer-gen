    "intro": "Corrigiola propinqua, commonly known as the common sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in sandy or disturbed soils, often found in coastal dunes and gravelly areas. The plant has small, lobed leaves and produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas quickly. Due to its hardy nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
