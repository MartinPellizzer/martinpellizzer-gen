It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant features palmate leaves with deeply lobed margins, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forest understories. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
