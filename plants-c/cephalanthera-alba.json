    "intro": "Cephalanthera alba, commonly known as the white helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, straight stems that bear lance-shaped leaves and a single, white or pale green flower with a distinctive hooded lip. The plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in shaded, moist woodlands. It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a key feature of many orchids. Cephalanthera alba is noted for its lack of showy petals and its subtle, elegant appearance."
