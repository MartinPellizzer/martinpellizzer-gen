It features dense, grass-like foliage with leaves arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy areas or along water edges. Cyperus verticillatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a water garden plant."
