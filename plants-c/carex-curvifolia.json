    "intro": "Carex curvifolia, commonly known as the curly-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It features grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly curled appearance, contributing to its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically found in dense, cylindrical clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in wetland restoration projects. Carex curvifolia plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
