It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to ovate leaves, and small, white or pinkish flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in botanical gardens and natural habitats."
