    "intro": "Clavija latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf clavija, is a perennial plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Clavija latifolia thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
