    "intro": "Chaetocephala, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to salty, windy environments. Their foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss and protect against salt spray. The flowers are usually blue or purple and are arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Chaetocephala species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing coastal soils."
