    "intro": "Cyanoneuron pedunculatum, commonly known as the blue-flowered tree, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue petals and its unique branching pattern, which resembles a cluster of small branches. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are broad and have a waxy surface, which helps in reducing water loss in its humid environment. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
