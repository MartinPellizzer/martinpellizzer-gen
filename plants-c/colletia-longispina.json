    "intro": "Colletia longispina, commonly known as the long-spined cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny stems and ability to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual element to its desert habitat. Its spines are modified leaves that help reduce water loss and provide protection against herbivores. Colletia longispina is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
