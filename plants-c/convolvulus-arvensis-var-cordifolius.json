    "intro": "Convolvulus arvensis var. cordifolius, commonly known as heartleaf field bindweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a vigorous growth habit and can form dense mats, often invading disturbed soils and agricultural fields. Its stems are trailing or ascending, and it spreads primarily through rhizomes and seeds. It is considered a weed in many regions due to its persistent nature and ability to thrive in various soil types."
