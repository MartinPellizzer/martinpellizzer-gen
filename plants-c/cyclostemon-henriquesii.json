    "intro": "Cyclostemon henriquesii, commonly known as the Henriques's cyclostemon, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant features palmate leaves with lobed segments, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
