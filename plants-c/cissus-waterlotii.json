    "intro": "Cissus waterlotii, commonly known as the African dewberry, is a climbing shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found growing along riverbanks and in dense vegetation. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens."
