    "intro": "Chamaesciadium acaule var. simplex, commonly known as the smooth-leaved dwarf lily of the valley, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are typically smooth and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale green, blooming in early summer. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
