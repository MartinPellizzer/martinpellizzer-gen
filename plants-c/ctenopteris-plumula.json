    "intro": "Ctenopteris plumula, commonly known as the dwarf chain fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact size and distinctive, clustered fronds that form a dense, bushy appearance. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread horizontally, often forming colonies. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, tooth-like projections along the edges. Ctenopteris plumula thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
