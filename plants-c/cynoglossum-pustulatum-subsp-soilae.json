It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a hairy texture, and it produces bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. It is characterized by its distinctive seed pods that split open to release small, hairy seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
