    "intro": "Cyperus insignis, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes grass-like plants known for their distinctive three-ranked leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its slender, grass-like stems are often clustered, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Cyperus insignis is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
