    "intro": "Cuscuta epithymum subsp. trifolii, commonly known as the three-leaved dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched stem covered in tiny, adhesive twining structures called haustoria, which attach to the host. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its life cycle involves seed germination, attachment to a host, and the development of a network of haustoria to extract water and nutrients. The three-leaved dodder is an example of a holoparasitic species, meaning it cannot survive without a host."
