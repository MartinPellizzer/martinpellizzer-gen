It is typically found in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that often lie close to the water surface, with small, opposite leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and arranged in clusters, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Callitriche brutia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
