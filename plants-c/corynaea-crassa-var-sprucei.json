    "intro": "Corynaea crassa var. sprucei, commonly known as the Spruce's roughleaf maple, is a variant of the roughleaf maple native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its coarsely toothed, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats. This variant is valued for its ornamental value and ecological benefits in forest ecosystems."
