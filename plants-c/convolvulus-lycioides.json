    "intro": "Convolvulus lycioides, commonly known as the common bindweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit, with opposite, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from white to pink or purple. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often becoming invasive due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
