    "intro": "Centaurium multicaule, commonly known as the clustered chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, ascending stems that are often branched and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in the axils of the leaves, typically blooming from June to August. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence. Centaurium multicaule is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks, thriving in temperate climates."
