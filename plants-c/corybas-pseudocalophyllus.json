    "intro": "Corybas pseudocalophyllus, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive helmet-shaped, hooded flower that resembles a protective covering over the reproductive structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its flowers are usually dull green or brown, which helps it blend into its natural habitat. Corybas pseudocalophyllus is a terrestrial orchid with a short, fibrous root system and a single, fleshy rhizome."
