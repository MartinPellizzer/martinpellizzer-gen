It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features upright, hairy stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Carduus narcissi is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can sometimes become invasive in certain regions."
