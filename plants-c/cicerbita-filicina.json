    "intro": "Cicerbita filicina, commonly known as the slender bittercress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its seeds are enclosed in a siliqua, a dry, pod-like structure that splits open when mature. Cicerbita filicina is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
