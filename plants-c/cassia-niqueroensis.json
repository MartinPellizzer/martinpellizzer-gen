    "intro": "Cassia niqueroensis, commonly known as the Niquero's cassia, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant is known for its striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments, giving it a delicate appearance. Cassia niqueroensis is often found in moist, tropical forests and is valued for its ornamental beauty."
