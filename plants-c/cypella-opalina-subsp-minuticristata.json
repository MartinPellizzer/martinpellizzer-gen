    "intro": "Cypella opalina subsp. minuticristata, commonly known as the opal cypella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
