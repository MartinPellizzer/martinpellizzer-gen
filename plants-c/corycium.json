These plants are characterized by their intricate and often showy flowers, which typically feature three petals and three sepals. Corycium species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. They thrive in humid, shaded environments and require well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The genus includes several species, each with unique floral structures and color variations."
