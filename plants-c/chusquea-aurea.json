It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that forms clumps or tussocks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Its leaves are narrow, stiff, and often have a whitish or golden hue on their undersides, giving it its common name. Chusquea aurea is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
