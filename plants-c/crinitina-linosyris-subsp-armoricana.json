    "intro": "Crinitina linosyris subsp. armoricana, commonly known as the Desert Evening Primrose, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a compact, sprawling growth habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically borne in clusters at the ends of the stems, and the plant is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils. The subspecies armoricana is distinguished by its robust growth and larger flowers compared to other subspecies of Crinitina linosyris."
