    "intro": "Cupania trachycarpa, commonly known as the roughcup hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and hairy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the spring and summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. Cupania trachycarpa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks."
