    "intro": "Clematis alpina var. carunculosa, commonly known as the alpine clematis, is a perennial vine native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, climbing stems with palmately compound leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale blue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots are adapted to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
