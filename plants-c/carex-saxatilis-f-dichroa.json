    "intro": "Carex saxatilis f. dichroa, commonly known as the two-colored sedge, is a variant of the common sedge characterized by its distinctive bicoloration. It typically features dark green basal leaves that transition to a lighter green or silver hue towards the tips. This plant is a perennial herb that thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit make it a visually appealing addition to rock gardens or wetland landscapes. The inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated."
