    "intro": "Cynodon maritimus, commonly known as coastal Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and tufted inflorescences, which are adapted to withstand salt spray and sandy soils. This plant thrives in saline environments and is often found in dunes, beaches, and coastal plains. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats that stabilize shorelines and prevent erosion. Cynodon maritimus is also valued for its ornamental use in coastal landscaping due to its hardy nature and attractive appearance."
