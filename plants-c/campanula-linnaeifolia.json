    "intro": "Campanula linnaeifolia, commonly known as the Linnaeus bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Campanula linnaeifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
