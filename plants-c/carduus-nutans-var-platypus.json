    "intro": "Carduus nutans var. platypus, commonly known as the flatleaf musk thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, spiny leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in wastelands. Its leaves are broad and have a flat, slightly ribbed appearance, distinguishing it from other Carduus species. The plant is known for its strong, musky aroma, which is more pronounced in its flowers than in its foliage."
