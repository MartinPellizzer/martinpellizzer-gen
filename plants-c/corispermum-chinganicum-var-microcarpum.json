    "intro": "Corispermum chinganicum var. microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited sandmat, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It typically forms dense mats of prostrate stems covered with fine, soft hairs. The leaves are small, linear, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, pale yellow, and clustered in branched inflorescences. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are adapted for dispersal by wind, typical of its harsh, dry habitat."
