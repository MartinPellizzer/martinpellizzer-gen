    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 hanseniana, commonly known as the Hansen's sedge, is a hybrid plant within the Carex genus, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit. It typically produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are the flowering structures of sedges, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it can vary in height depending on environmental conditions. Carex \u00d7 hanseniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
