It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in open habitats such as dunes, roadsides, and disturbed areas. The plant features small, green, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, hairy glands, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are tiny, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in early spring. It is a hardy species that plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local insect populations."
