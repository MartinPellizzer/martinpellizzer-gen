    "intro": "Cadamba jasminiflora, commonly known as the jasmine wood or fragrant wood, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often giving off a strong jasmine-like scent. These flowers are typically followed by small, oval-shaped fruits that contain a single seed. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
