    "intro": "Ctenitis scabrosa, commonly known as the rough shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the fronds. Ctenitis scabrosa is native to various regions in Southeast Asia and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in its habitat."
