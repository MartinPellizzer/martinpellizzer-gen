    "intro": "Casuarina stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved she-oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It has needle-like leaves arranged in spirals, giving it a distinctive appearance reminiscent of a pine tree. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. Casuarina stricta is valued for its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil in coastal environments."
