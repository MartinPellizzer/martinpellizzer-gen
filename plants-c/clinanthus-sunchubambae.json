It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and smartweed. The plant is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
