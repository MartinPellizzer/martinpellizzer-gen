    "intro": "Coelogyne psittacina, commonly known as the parrot orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its humid, shaded forest habitat. The plant produces striking, pendulous inflorescences with showy, brightly colored flowers resembling parrots, hence its common name. Its flowers are typically yellow with red or orange markings, and they bloom in the summer months. Coelogyne psittacina is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
