    "intro": "Crataegus haemacarpa, commonly known as the red-fruited hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible for birds and mammals but are generally not consumed by humans. Crataegus haemacarpa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and providing habitat in forest ecosystems."
