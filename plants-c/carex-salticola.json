    "intro": "Carex salticola, commonly known as the jumping sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Carex salticola is also an important food source for various wildlife species, including waterfowl and small mammals."
