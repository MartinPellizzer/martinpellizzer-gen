    "intro": "Cynorkis mammuthus, commonly known as the African elephant's foot, is a striking succulent native to southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that can grow up to several meters in height, often with a swollen base resembling an elephant's foot. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is adapted to arid environments. Cynorkis mammuthus is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
