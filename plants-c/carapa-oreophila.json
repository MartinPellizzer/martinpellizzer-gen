    "intro": "Carapa oreophila, commonly known as the cloud forest mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. The tree bears woody, oblong fruits that contain a single, large seed surrounded by a fibrous aril. Carapa oreophila is valued for its durable, heavy timber, which is used in furniture and construction. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
