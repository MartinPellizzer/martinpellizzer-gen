    "intro": "Calcaratolobelia pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's lobelia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
