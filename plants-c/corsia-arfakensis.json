    "intro": "Corsia arfakensis, commonly known as the Arfakensis Corsia, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Horn of Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Corsia arfakensis is considered a vulnerable species."
