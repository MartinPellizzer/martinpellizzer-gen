It is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of small, pale green or white flowers. The plant produces unique, tubular flowers that are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Ceropegia levyi is often grown as a decorative plant due to its attractive foliage and easy care requirements."
