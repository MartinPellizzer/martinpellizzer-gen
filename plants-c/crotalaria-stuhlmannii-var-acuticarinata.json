    "intro": "Crotalaria stuhlmannii var. acuticarinata, commonly known as the sharp-pointed crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its typical legume structure and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces distinctive yellow flowers with two lobes. Its seeds are enclosed in a pod that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds effectively. This species is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
