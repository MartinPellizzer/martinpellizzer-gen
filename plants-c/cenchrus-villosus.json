    "intro": "Cenchrus villosus, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its fibrous root system makes it a useful plant for erosion control in certain ecosystems."
