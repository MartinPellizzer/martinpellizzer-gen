    "intro": "Catapodium lolium, commonly known as goatgrass, is a member of the grass family (Poaceae). It is a perennial plant that typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings. Botanically, it is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
