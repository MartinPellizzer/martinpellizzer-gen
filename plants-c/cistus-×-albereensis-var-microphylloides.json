    "intro": "Cistus \u00d7 albereensis var. microphylloides, commonly known as the dwarf rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is well adapted to full sun exposure. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in xerophytic gardens."
