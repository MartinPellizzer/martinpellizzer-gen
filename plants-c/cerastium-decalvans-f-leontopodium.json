    "intro": "Cerastium decalvans f. leontopodium, commonly known as the woolly mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its dense, white, woolly foliage. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is native to the mountainous regions of Europe. The plant features small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its hirsute (hairy) leaves and stems provide insulation against cold temperatures, adapting it to alpine and rocky environments. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and scree slopes at high elevations."
