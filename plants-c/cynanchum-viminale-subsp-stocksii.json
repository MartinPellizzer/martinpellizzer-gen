    "intro": "Cynanchum viminale subsp. stocksii, commonly known as the creeping milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The species is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in sandy or rocky soils."
