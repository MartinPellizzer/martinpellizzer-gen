    "intro": "Cotoneaster frigidus f. pendulus, commonly known as the hanging cotoneaster, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in rocky or well-drained soils. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature in gardens and landscapes."
