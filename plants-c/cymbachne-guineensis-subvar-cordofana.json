    "intro": "Cymbachne guineensis subvar. cordofana, commonly known as the African grass or cordofana grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical Africa. It typically grows in open woodlands and savannas, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in panicles. It is characterized by its ability to form dense tussocks, which help prevent soil erosion. This subspecies is valued for its use in livestock feed and for stabilizing degraded soils in agroforestry systems."
