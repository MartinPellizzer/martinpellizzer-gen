    "intro": "Croton rivinifolius var. albescens, commonly known as the white-veined croton, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that often display a striking contrast of deep green with prominent white or yellow veins. The plant produces clusters of small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by orange or red berries, which are attractive to birds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
