    "intro": "Cerastium doerfleri, commonly known as the snowberry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It produces small, bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Cerastium doerfleri is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its compact growth and ornamental appeal."
