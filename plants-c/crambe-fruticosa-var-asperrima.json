    "intro": "Crambe fruticosa var. asperrima, commonly known as the rough crampgrass, is a perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and rough, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Crambe fruticosa var. asperrima thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields."
