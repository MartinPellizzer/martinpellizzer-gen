    "intro": "Caladium ottonis, commonly known as the Otto's arrowleaf, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that display vibrant shades of red, pink, and white, often with a contrasting green border. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is the main ornamental feature, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas and indoor spaces. Caladium ottonis is typically propagated through tuberous roots, which can be divided and planted in spring for new growth."
