    "intro": "Convolvulus sepiarius, commonly known as the sea convolvulus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are alternate and palmately lobed, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Convolvulus sepiarius is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate moderate drought conditions."
