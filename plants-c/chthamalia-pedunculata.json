    "intro": "Chthamalia pedunculata, commonly known as the red alga, is a species of marine red algae found primarily in temperate coastal regions. It belongs to the family Rhodomelaceae and is characterized by its bright red to pink coloration due to the presence of phycoerythrin. The plant has a thallus that is typically branched and filamentous, with a gelatinous texture. It thrives in intertidal zones and is often found attached to rocky substrates. Chthamalia pedunculata plays an important role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
