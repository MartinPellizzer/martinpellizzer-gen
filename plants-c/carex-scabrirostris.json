    "intro": "Carex scabrirostris, commonly known as the rough-beaked sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. Its flowering heads, which are small and clustered, produce seeds that are dispersed by wind. Carex scabrirostris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
