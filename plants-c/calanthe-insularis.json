    "intro": "Calanthe insularis, commonly known as the island calanthe, is a rare orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically features dark green, strap-like leaves and produces inflorescences with several pink to white flowers. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Calanthe insularis is considered endangered."
