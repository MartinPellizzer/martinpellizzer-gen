    "intro": "Cynorkis parva, commonly known as the small cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. This plant is characterized by its compact size and unique, fern-like leaves that grow in a rosette pattern. Cynorkis parva produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
