It is characterized by its distinctive purple-tinged, tubular husks that encase its edible nuts. The plant typically grows to a height of 2\u20134 meters and features alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and it relies on wind pollination. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and seasonal fruiting."
