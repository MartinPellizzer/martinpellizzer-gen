    "intro": "Carex glareosa subsp. soriofkensis, commonly known as the Siberian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the colder regions of Asia, particularly Siberia and northern China. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands, marshes, or along riverbanks. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is notable for its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh, temperate climates."
