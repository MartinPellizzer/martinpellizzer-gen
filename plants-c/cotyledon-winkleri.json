    "intro": "Cotyledon winkleri, commonly known as the Winkler's cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with red or purple edges, which help it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight to maintain its vibrant coloration. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor plant collections."
