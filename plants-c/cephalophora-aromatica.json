    "intro": "Cephalophora aromatica, commonly known as the sweet sedge, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is a perennial herb that grows in marshy areas, characterized by its tall, grass-like leaves and showy, fragrant white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, three-lobed seed capsules that mature in late summer. Its aromatic qualities are derived from the volatile oils present in its leaves and flowers. Cephalophora aromatica plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
