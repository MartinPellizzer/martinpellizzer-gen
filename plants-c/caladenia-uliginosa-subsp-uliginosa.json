    "intro": "Caladenia uliginosa subsp. uliginosa, commonly known as the bog orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, strikingly colored flower that typically ranges from yellow to orange. The plant thrives in wet, acidic soils, often found in swampy or heathland environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
