    "intro": "Canistrum sandrae, commonly known as the Sandra's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and yellowish-orange flowers. The plant attaches itself to host trees, such as mangroves, and derives some of its nutrients from the host. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain insects and birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
