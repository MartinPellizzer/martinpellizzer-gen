    "intro": "Citrus luteoturgida, commonly known as the yellow turgid citrus, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Rutaceae family. It is characterized by its small, yellow-orange fruits that are typically harvested when fully mature. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves and produces small, fragrant white flowers. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of Malaysia and Indonesia. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
