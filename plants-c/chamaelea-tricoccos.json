It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
