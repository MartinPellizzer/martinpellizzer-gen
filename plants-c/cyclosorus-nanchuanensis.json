    "intro": "Cyclosorus nanchuanensis, commonly known as the Nanchuan cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern native to China. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically less than 5 centimeters in diameter. The plant has a unique rhizome system that allows it to anchor itself in shallow water environments. Its spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
