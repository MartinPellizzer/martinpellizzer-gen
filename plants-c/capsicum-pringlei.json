    "intro": "Capsicum pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's chili pepper, is a rare and unique species native to Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, elongated fruits that range in color from yellow to red. The plant typically grows in arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its succulent leaves and compact growth habit. Its flowers are usually yellow or white, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and endangered status, Capsicum pringlei is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
