    "intro": "Cytisus biflorus subsp. borysthenicus, commonly known as the Crimean broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, often spiny stems and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
