    "intro": "Cirsium campylolepis, commonly known as the bentleaf thistle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are often curled or bent, giving it its common name, while its flowers are arranged in a compact, spherical head. Cirsium campylolepis is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
