    "intro": "Conoclinium maritimum, commonly known as coastal blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. The plant produces showy, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a silvery underside that gives it a misty appearance. Conoclinium maritimum is well adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it a valuable plant for coastal restoration projects."
