    "intro": "Centaurea scabiosa subsp. grinensis, commonly known as the Gorni's thistle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features upright, sparsely branched stems that are covered in coarse, woolly hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to purple composite flowers with a distinctive, spiky center, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with rough, serrated edges, and often have a bluish-gray hue due to dense pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to temperate to cold climates."
