    "intro": "Cynorkis triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaf cycad, is a unique species native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant's foliage consists of three leaflets, giving it its common name, and it produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Cynorkis triphylla is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate to thrive."
