    "intro": "Carex paniculata subsp. elongata, commonly known as the elongated sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it a common component of wetland vegetation. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments."
