    "intro": "Colchicum rausii, commonly known as the autumn crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean. It produces striking violet or purple flowers in the fall, which contrast beautifully with its dark green foliage. The plant has a corm-like structure that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and appear after the flowers, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Colchicum rausii is valued in gardens for its unique blooming period and elegant appearance."
