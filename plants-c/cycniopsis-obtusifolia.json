It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Cycniopsis obtusifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and conservation efforts."
