    "intro": "Caucalis maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. The plant features blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Caucalis maritima is typically found growing in dunes and along shorelines, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion."
