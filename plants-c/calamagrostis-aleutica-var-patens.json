    "intro": "Calamagrostis aleutica var. patens, commonly known as the spreading tussock grass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of Alaska and northern Canada. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silver-blue foliage that turns golden in the fall. The plant produces feathery, panicle-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and erosion control properties. This variety is particularly valued for its ability to thrive in coastal environments and its low maintenance requirements."
