    "intro": "Comparettia larae, commonly known as the Lara's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white, fragrant flowers that resemble those of the ghost orchid. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in the humid, shaded environments of its habitat. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, often clustered at the base of the plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Comparettia larae is considered a critically endangered species."
