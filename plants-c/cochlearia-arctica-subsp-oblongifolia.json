    "intro": "Cochlearia arctica subsp. oblongifolia, commonly known as the Arctic cochlearia, is a low-growing plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a single umbel. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its morphology reflects evolutionary adaptations to survive in harsh, high-altitude environments."
