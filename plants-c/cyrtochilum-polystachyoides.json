    "intro": "Cyrtochilum polystachyoides, commonly known as the hairy orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of hairy, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in the understory. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. The flowers are often short-lived but attract various pollinators, including bees and moths."
