    "intro": "Chamaecytisus supinus, commonly known as the creeping rose bush or dwarf broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the western Mediterranean. It features slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or small bushes. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are small, leathery, and opposite, with a greyish-green color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant plant suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover."
