    "intro": "Carpinus sunpanensis, commonly known as the Sunpan hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to China. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, winged seeds enclosed in a prickly husk, which are dispersed by wind. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with shallow fissures that become more pronounced with age."
