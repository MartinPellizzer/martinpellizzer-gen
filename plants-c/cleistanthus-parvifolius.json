It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Cleistanthus parvifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
