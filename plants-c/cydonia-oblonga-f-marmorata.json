It is characterized by its distinctive mottled, marbled skin that gives it a unique appearance. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically growing to a height of 3 to 6 meters. Its leaves are ovate with a serrated margin, and it produces fragrant, white flowers in the spring. The fruit is usually harvested in late autumn and is known for its sweet, aromatic flavor when fully ripe."
