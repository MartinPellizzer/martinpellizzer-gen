    "intro": "Cassia occidentalis var. schinifolia, commonly known as golden shower tree or Indian laburnum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and pinnate, with 10\u201320 pairs of ovate to lanceolate leaflets. The plant produces long, drooping clusters of bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. The seeds are encased in a hard, woody pod and are often used in traditional medicine."
