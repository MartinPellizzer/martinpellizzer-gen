    "intro": "Colpodium pisidicum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, where it forms dense mats on the water surface or along the substrate. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, oval leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with four to five petals, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Colpodium pisidicum plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
