    "intro": "Cachrys ferulacea, commonly known as the golden saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It has a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring or early summer, which are clustered in a cup-like arrangement. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Cachrys ferulacea is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and is an important component of Arctic and alpine ecosystems."
