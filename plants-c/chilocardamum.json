It is native to the tropical regions of South and Southeast Asia, particularly India, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia. The plant produces small, fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that eventually give way to dark brown, aromatic seeds. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant is valued for its essential oils, which are used in both culinary and medicinal applications."
