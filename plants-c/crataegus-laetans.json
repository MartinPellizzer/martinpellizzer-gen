    "intro": "Crataegus laetans, commonly known as the sweetthorn or Mayflower, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red, edible berries that ripen in late summer. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Crataegus laetans is often used in hedges and for its ornamental value due to its showy flowers and berries."
