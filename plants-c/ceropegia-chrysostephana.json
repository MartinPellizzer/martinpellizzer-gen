    "intro": "Ceropegia chrysostephana, commonly known as the golden-step horned frog plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features fleshy, tuberous stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white, which are often visited by specific pollinators. Its leaves are typically narrow and may have a slightly hairy texture. Ceropegia chrysostephana is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
