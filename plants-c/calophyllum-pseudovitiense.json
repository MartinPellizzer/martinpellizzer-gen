It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, elliptical leaves. The plant produces yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, oblong fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
