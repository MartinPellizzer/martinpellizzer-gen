    "intro": "Chamaesyce selloi, commonly known as the Sello's sandmat, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features a mat-forming growth habit with densely packed, hairy, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine white trichomes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with low moisture availability. Its succulent leaves help it store water, making it well-suited for harsh, dry environments."
