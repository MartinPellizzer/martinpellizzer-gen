    "intro": "Crataegus serratissima, commonly known as the serrated hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries known as haws, which are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated edges, and turn yellow in the fall. Crataegus serratissima is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight."
