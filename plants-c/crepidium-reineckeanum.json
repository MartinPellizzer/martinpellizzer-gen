    "intro": "Crepidium reineckeanum, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, pinkish-purple pouch-like flower that resembles a slipper, which is a distinctive feature among orchids. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and the plant is known for its delicate, ephemeral blooms that last only a few weeks. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
