    "intro": "Cyperus pungens, commonly known as spiked flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like stems that grow from rhizomes and produce spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along water bodies. Its rapid growth makes it an aggressive weed in aquatic environments. Botanically, it belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants."
