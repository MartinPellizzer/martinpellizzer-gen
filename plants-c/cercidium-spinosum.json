    "intro": "Cercidium spinosum, commonly known as the creosote bush, is a drought-tolerant shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are clustered in dense, spiny inflorescences. It is well adapted to arid environments and can survive in poor soils. Cercidium spinosum plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
