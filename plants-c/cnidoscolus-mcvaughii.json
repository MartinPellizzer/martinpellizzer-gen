It is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of urticating hairs, which can cause skin irritation. The plant also produces yellowish-orange fruits that contain seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems."
