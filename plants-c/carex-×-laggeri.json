    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 laggeri, commonly known as the hybrid marsh sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a sterile hybrid between Carex lyngbyei and Carex sanguinea, often found in wetland environments. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, such as marshes and along stream banks. Due to its hybrid nature, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest in botanical studies."
