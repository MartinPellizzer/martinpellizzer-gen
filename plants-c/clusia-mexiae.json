    "intro": "Clusia mexiae, commonly known as Mexican glorybower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The leaves are thick, leathery, and often have a waxy coating, which helps the plant retain moisture in its native habitat. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, are clustered in dense inflorescences and attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Clusia mexiae is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
