    "intro": "Cordia ambigua, commonly known as the white cordia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal."
