    "intro": "Chelonopsis yagiharana var. jesoensis, commonly known as the Jesoensis Chelonopsis, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of East Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are finely divided and have a distinctive, delicate appearance, while its flowers are small and clustered. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanical curiosity and subject of ecological study."
