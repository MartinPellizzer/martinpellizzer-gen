    "intro": "Chamaefilix obtusifolia var. riparia, commonly known as river saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, rocky habitats along riverbanks and stream sides. It features basal rosettes of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five pinkish-white petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in riparian zones, making it ecologically significant. It is well adapted to wet environments and can tolerate periodic flooding."
