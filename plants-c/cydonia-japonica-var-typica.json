    "intro": "Cydonia japonica var. typica, commonly known as the Japanese quince, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It produces fragrant, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by orange to red, fleshy fruits resembling pears. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for temperate climates. Its fruit is often used in jams and preserves due to its high pectin content. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, adding to its ornamental value."
