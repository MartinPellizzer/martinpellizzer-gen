    "intro": "Cortesia, commonly known as the \"flower of the sea,\" is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its vibrant blue or violet petals, which resemble the color of the ocean, and its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found growing near the shoreline. Cortesia is a member of the Boraginaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with similar medicinal properties. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a symbol of coastal beauty and resilience."
