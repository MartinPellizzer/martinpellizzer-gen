    "intro": "Colysis flexiloba var. undulatorepanda, commonly known as the undulating flexile fern, is a rare and striking variant of the flexile fern. It is characterized by its delicate, undulating fronds that give it a unique, wave-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate rainforests. Its leaves are long and slender, with a soft, feathery texture that distinguishes it from other fern species. This variant is highly sought after by botanists and collectors due to its aesthetic appeal and limited distribution."
