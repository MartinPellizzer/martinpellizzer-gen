    "intro": "Corynandra simplicifolia, commonly known as the simple-leaved corynandra, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its simple, elliptic leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in inflorescences, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Corynandra simplicifolia is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks. It is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native environment."
