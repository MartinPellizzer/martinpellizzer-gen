    "intro": "Ceropegia penchalakonensis, commonly known as the Panchalakon ceropegia, is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a trailing or ascending perennial vine characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale green, with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insects. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
