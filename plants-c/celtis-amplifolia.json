    "intro": "Celtis amplifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf boxwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features simple, opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically 2\u20135 inches long and have a smooth, waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by small, round, greenish fruits that mature to a dark blue or black color. Its foliage remains dense and compact, making it a popular choice for hedges and ornamental landscaping. Celtis amplifolia is relatively low maintenance and thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun exposure."
