    "intro": "Castilleja puberula, commonly known as the silky broomrape, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks true leaves and chlorophyll, relying on its host plants for nutrients through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, where it can parasitize a variety of herbaceous plants. Due to its lack of photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its environment."
