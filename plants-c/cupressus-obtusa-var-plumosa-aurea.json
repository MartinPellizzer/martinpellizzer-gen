    "intro": "Cupressus obtusa var. plumosa-aurea, commonly known as the golden thread cedar, is a cultivar of the Japanese cedar. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery foliage that gives it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The leaves are often a striking golden-yellow color, especially in full sun. It has a compact, pyramidal growth habit and is often used in ornamental landscaping. This variety is relatively slow-growing and requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive."
