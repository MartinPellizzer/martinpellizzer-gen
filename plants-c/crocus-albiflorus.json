    "intro": "Crocus albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is closely related to other members of the Iridaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its delicate appearance and early blooming habit, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
