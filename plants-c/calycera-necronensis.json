    "intro": "Calycera necronensis, commonly known as the Death's Crown, is a rare and enigmatic plant species characterized by its intricate, spiky floral structure. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is typically found in shaded, moist forest understories. The plant's flowers are composed of multiple overlapping calyces, giving it a crown-like appearance. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its humid habitat. The species is notable for its slow growth and unique pollination mechanism involving specific nocturnal insects."
