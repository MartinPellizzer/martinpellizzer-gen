    "intro": "Catasetum nanayanum, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a distinctive, showy inflorescence with bright yellow petals and a pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, particularly bees, which are attracted by its nectar. The orchid's unique morphology and ecological role make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
