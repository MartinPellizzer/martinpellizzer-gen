    "intro": "Cynanchica lipskyana, commonly known as the Turk's Cap or Turk's Cap Milkweed, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its striking, helmet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant features opposite, lanceolate leaves with a hairy texture, and its stem is often covered in fine, white pubescence. It produces follicles that contain toxic latex, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores. Cynanchica lipskyana is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils."
