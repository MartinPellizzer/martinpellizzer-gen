    "intro": "Cephalocereus sanchezmejoradae, commonly known as the Sanchezmegorada Cephalocereus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach several meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a trait common among many cacti adapted to desert environments. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a robust root system for water storage. This species is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
