    "intro": "Campanula tomentosa var. sporadum, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fuzzy, grayish-blue foliage and bell-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. It is relatively low maintenance and resistant to pests and diseases."
