    "intro": "Corysanthes unguiculata, commonly known as the black orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its striking dark purple to black flowers, which are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its specialized pollination mechanism involving specific insect species. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
