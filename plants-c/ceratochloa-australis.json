    "intro": "Ceratochloa australis, commonly known as the New Zealand hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to New Zealand. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are pollinated by wind. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in its natural habitat."
