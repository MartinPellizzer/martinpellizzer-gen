    "intro": "Cornus alba var. interior, commonly known as the interior dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red berries in the fall, which are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, and turn bright red in autumn. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
