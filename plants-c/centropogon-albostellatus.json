    "intro": "Centropogon albostellatus, commonly known as the white-streaked lily, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Pontederiaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range from blue to violet in color. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sunny conditions. Its leaves are elongated and narrow, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable water conditions."
