    "intro": "Campanula glomerata var. aggregata, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense clusters of blue or purple bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
