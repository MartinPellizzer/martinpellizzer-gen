    "intro": "Convolvulus oenotheroides, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial with sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that open in the late afternoon and close at dawn, a characteristic known as nyctinasty. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant is also notable for its medicinal properties, with its seeds containing oils used in traditional remedies."
