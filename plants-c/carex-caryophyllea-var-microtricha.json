    "intro": "Carex caryophyllea var. microtricha, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial sedge native to the wetlands of North America. It features grass-like foliage with narrow, dark green leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers in early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is noted for its compact growth habit and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
