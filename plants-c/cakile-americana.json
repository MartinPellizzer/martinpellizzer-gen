    "intro": "Cakile americana, commonly known as coastal bladderwrack, is a perennial flowering plant native to the coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, bladder-like leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in saline and sandy environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by capsules that release seeds. It is often found growing in tidal zones and along shorelines, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion. Its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions makes it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
