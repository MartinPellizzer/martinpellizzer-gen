    "intro": "Cactus opuntia var. vulgaris, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems called cladodes, which are adapted for water storage and photosynthesis. The plant produces vibrant flowers, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. The cactus is also valued for its ability to thrive in arid environments and its use in traditional medicine and as a food source."
