    "intro": "Corydalis umbrosa, commonly known as the shadowy corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, often purple or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its foliage consists of slender, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Corydalis umbrosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with partial shade."
