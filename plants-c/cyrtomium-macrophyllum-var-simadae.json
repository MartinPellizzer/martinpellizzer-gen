    "intro": "Cyrtomium macrophyllum var. simadae, commonly known as the Japanese holly fern, is a variety of the holly fern genus native to Japan. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense, compact clumps over time. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
