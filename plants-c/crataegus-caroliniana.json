    "intro": "Crataegus caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 feet and features thorny branches, simple oval leaves, and showy white or pink flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
