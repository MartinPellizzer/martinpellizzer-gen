    "intro": "Cynanchica tragacanthoides, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its woody stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds with a hard coat, adapted for survival in harsh environments. It is often found in sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xerophytic habitats. Botanically, it belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is known for its nitrogen-fixing abilities."
