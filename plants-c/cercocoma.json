    "intro": "Cercocoma, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. The plant is characterized by its hard, dense wood and deep root system, which allows it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are typically small and compound, and it produces small, pea-like flowers. Cercocoma species are valued for their resilience and are sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
