    "intro": "Centaurea montis-borlae, commonly known as the alpine centaury, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Centaurea montis-borlae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and color."
