    "intro": "Croton wullschlaegelianus, commonly known as the Wullschlaegel's croton, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is known for its diverse and often strikingly ornamental plants. The plant is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its foliage rather than its flowers. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not commonly found in cultivation outside of its native range."
