    "intro": "Croton ovatus, commonly known as the white croton, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often variegated with white, yellow, and green hues. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers that are followed by woody, orange-colored fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens in tropical and subtropical regions."
