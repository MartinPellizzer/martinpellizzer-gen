    "intro": "Calamus mellitus, commonly known as sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its aromatic, sword-shaped leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is native to wetlands and marshy areas in Asia, particularly in regions like India and China. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. The plant's distinctive fragrance is attributed to compounds such as methylheptanone and other volatile oils."
