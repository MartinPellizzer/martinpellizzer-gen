It is characterized by its slender, elongated stems that can grow up to two meters in height. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often resembling small cups. It is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its botanical features make it a notable species in the study of xerophytic plant adaptations."
