    "intro": "Crotalaria striata var. acutifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are often accompanied by glandular hairs. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds through mechanical means. This species is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
