    "intro": "Carex umbellata subsp. abdita, commonly known as the dwarf umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are often dark green in color. Its flowering structure consists of a terminal umbel of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
