It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its leaves are leathery and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is often used in ornamental gardening for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
