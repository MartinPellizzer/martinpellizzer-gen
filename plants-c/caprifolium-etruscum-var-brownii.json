    "intro": "Caprifolium etruscum var. brownii, commonly known as the Etruscan honeysuckle, is a rare variant of the honeysuckle species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring, typically in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge, and its stems are often covered in fine, whitish hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or woodland borders. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral structure, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
