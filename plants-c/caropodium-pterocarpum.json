    "intro": "Caropodium pterocarpum, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a deciduous shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, milky sap that is toxic if ingested. The plant has simple, opposite leaves and produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The plant's adaptability to various soil types makes it a resilient species in its native habitat."
