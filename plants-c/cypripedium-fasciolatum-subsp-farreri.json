    "intro": "Cypripedium fasciolatum subsp. farreri, commonly known as the Farrer's lady's slipper, is a rare and elegant orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its botanical features include a slender stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
