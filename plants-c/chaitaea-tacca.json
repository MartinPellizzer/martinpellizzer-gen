    "intro": "Chaitaea tacca, commonly known as the sacred lotus of Borneo, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter, making it one of the largest broadleaf plants in the world. The plant produces striking white or pink flowers that bloom at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. Its unique morphology and cultural significance have made it a subject of both botanical study and spiritual reverence. Chaitaea tacca thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and nutrient-rich soil for optimal growth."
