    "intro": "Cydonia oblonga var. maliformis, commonly known as the Japanese quince, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It produces showy, fragrant flowers in late spring, followed by yellow, edible fruits that ripen in autumn. The plant is characterized by its thick, rough bark and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes. The fruit, while not as commonly consumed as other quince varieties, is valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary uses."
