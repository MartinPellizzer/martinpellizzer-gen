    "intro": "Calophyllum amblyphyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf calophyllum, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Calophyllaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange to red berries containing a single seed. Its wood is valued for its durability and is used in traditional crafts and as a source of natural dye. The plant also has medicinal uses in some traditional systems, though further research is needed to validate its potential applications."
