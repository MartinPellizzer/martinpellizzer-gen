    "intro": "Cyclanthera testudinea, commonly known as the testudinea cucumber, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other cucurbits like pumpkins and squash. The plant produces small, bitter, green fruits that are typically not eaten by humans but are used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating, while its stems are hairy and sprawling. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires support for its vine growth."
