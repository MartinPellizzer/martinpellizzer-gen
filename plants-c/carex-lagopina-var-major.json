    "intro": "Carex lagopina var. major, commonly known as the large tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spikelets that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant thrives in wet to moist environments, such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The leaves are usually narrow and have a slightly rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
