    "intro": "Columnea affinis, commonly known as the flame flower or red-flowered columnea, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting hummingbirds and other pollinators. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture and emits a mild, spicy scent. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Columnea affinis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
