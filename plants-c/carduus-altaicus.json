    "intro": "Carduus altaicus, commonly known as the Siberian thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, pale yellow flower heads. The plant produces achenes, which are small, dry fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. Its botanical features make it both a resilient weed and a potential invasive species in some regions."
