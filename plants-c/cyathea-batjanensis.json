    "intro": "Cyathea batjanensis, commonly known as the Batjan's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat. The fronds are typically bioluminescent at night, which helps attract pollinators."
