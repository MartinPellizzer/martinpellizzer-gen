    "intro": "Cyrtandra clarkei var. brachycalyx, commonly known as the short-calyx Cyrtandra, is a flowering plant belonging to the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in parts of Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically showy, with tubular corollas and prominent lobes, often in shades of white or yellow. This variant is noted for its relatively small calyx, which distinguishes it from other members of the Cyrtandra genus."
