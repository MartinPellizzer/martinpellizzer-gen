    "intro": "Cirsium calcicola, commonly known as the limestone thistle, is a perennial herb native to rocky and calcareous soils in Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its distribution is limited to specific regions with limestone substrates, making it a rare and localized species. Cirsium calcicola plays a role in supporting local pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its specialized habitat."
