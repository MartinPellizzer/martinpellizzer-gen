    "intro": "Caralluma flava, commonly known as the desert fig or golden torch cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of India and Africa. It features a cylindrical stem covered in small, spiny tubercles and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its ability to store water in its fleshy stems. It produces small, edible fruits that are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Caralluma flava is also known for its slow growth and long lifespan, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
