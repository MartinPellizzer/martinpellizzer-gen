    "intro": "Centropogon colombiensis, commonly known as the Colombian starflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to the cool, moist climate of its native habitat. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits called cypsela. Centropogon colombiensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
