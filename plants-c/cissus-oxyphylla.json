    "intro": "Cissus oxyphylla, commonly known as the silver vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. Cissus oxyphylla thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens. Its unique foliage and adaptability make it a valuable addition to horticultural collections."
