    "intro": "Conobea glechomoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marshmallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It features upright, hairy stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a distinctive glandular surface. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Conobea glechomoides is often found in marshy areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance."
