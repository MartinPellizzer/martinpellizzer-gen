    "intro": "Cactus sempervivi, commonly known as hen and chickens, is a unique succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces offsets, or \"chicks,\" which grow around the base of the main stem, giving it its characteristic appearance. It is known for its ability to survive extreme temperatures and drought, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its blooming period typically occurs in late spring, producing clusters of small, pink or white flowers."
