    "intro": "Cyrtomium macrosorum, commonly known as the large-leaf holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Cyrtomium macrosorum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to cultivated conditions."
