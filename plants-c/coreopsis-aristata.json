    "intro": "Coreopsis aristata, commonly known as the western coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across arid regions. Coreopsis aristata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-water conditions."
