    "intro": "Cyperus havanensis, commonly known as the Havana flatsedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and shallow waters, and is adapted to saturated soil conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered at the ends of its flowering stems. Cyperus havanensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
