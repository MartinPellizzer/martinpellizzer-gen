    "intro": "Crucianella glauca subsp. gilanica, commonly known as the Gilan coastal bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant characterized by its bladdery structures that aid in floating. It typically grows in brackish or freshwater environments, often found in coastal regions with shallow, still water. The plant has small, oval leaves that are usually submerged, with specialized bladders used for capturing prey. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, particularly in the Caspian Sea region. Its botanical features make it an important species in wetland ecosystems, contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
