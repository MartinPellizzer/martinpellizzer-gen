    "intro": "Centaurea myrioclada, commonly known as the many-bracted centaury, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm and produces numerous small, bract-like leaves along its stem. Its flowers are clustered in dense, cone-shaped inflorescences, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Centaurea myrioclada is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as slopes and coastal areas."
