    "intro": "Cyclosorus chaseanus, commonly known as the Chase's cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has finely divided, delicate fronds that form a rosette shape, often floating just below the water's surface. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
