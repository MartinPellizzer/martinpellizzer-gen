It features thick, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
