    "intro": "Cyrtomium lonchitoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often clustered closely together. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are arranged in a compact, rosette-like pattern. Cyrtomium lonchitoides is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
