    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 leucorrhodum, commonly known as the white lady's tresses, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of white to pale yellow flowers that resemble a cascade of tresses. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often on rocky or wooded slopes. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
