    "intro": "Chrysopogon benthamianus, commonly known as the Bentham's grass, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
