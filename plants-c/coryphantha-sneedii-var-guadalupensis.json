    "intro": "Coryphantha sneedii var. guadalupensis, commonly known as the Guadalupe hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, spiny areoles, which serve as protection against herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green, spiky structure. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
