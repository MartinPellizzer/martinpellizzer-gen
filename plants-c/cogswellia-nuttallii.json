    "intro": "Cogswellia nuttallii, commonly known as the Nuttall's cactus, is a species of flowering plant in the Cactaceae family. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its cylindrical stem covered in spines and its clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It has a slow growth rate and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Cogswellia nuttallii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
