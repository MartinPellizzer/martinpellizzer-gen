    "intro": "Ceratobium taurulinum, commonly known as the Taurine hairgrass, is a small, delicate grass species native to the steppes of southern Russia and the Caucasus. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats and is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. Its reproductive structures are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse seeds efficiently. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and fragile species."
