    "intro": "Coppensia calimaniorum, commonly known as the Calimaniorum cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive. Its botanical features make it an important subject for studying plant evolution and biodiversity."
