    "intro": "Chionanthus guangxiensis, commonly known as the Guangxi snowbell, is a rare flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountain forests, and is known for its ornamental value. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a smooth texture, while its fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds by wind. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
