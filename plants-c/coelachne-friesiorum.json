It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or arid regions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects or as a ornamental plant in dry landscapes."
