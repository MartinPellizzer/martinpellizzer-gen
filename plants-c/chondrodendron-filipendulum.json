    "intro": "Chondrodendron filipendulum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to South America. It is characterized by its straight, dark reddish-brown wood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy coating. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by elongated, woody fruits containing several seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
