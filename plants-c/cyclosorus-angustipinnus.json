    "intro": "Cyclosorus angustipinnus, commonly known as the narrow-pinnate water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, floating leaves that form a rosette structure, allowing it to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged, and it produces fruiting bodies known as achenes. Cyclosorus angustipinnus is often found in ponds, ditches, and wetlands, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystem dynamics. Its delicate appearance and adaptability make it an important component of freshwater flora."
