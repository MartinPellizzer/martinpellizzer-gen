    "intro": "Cymbidium floribundum var. pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a compact, evergreen orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features upright, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, pendulous flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. The plant prefers cool, bright indirect light and well-draining soil, making it suitable for indoor cultivation. It is prized for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements. This variety is particularly noted for its compact size and ability to bloom reliably in controlled environments."
