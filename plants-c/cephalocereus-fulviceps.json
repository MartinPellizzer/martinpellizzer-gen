    "intro": "Cephalocereus fulviceps, commonly known as the golden crown cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its spines are relatively short and sparse, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
