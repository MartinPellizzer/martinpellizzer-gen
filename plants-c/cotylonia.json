These plants are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers and succulent leaves. Cotylonia species typically have a short, thick stem with fleshy, alternate leaves that are often heart-shaped or ovate. They are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ease of cultivation. The flowers are usually borne in clusters and are pollinated by insects, contributing to their ecological significance."
