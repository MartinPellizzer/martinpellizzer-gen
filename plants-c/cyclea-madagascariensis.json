    "intro": "Cyclea madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar cycad, is a unique plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant is notable for its slow growth and ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils. It produces cones instead of flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a conservation concern."
