    "intro": "Coccinia senensis, commonly known as the Indian morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and squash, and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, round, orange-red fruits that are edible when ripe. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its rapid growth habit and ability to climb make it a popular choice for vertical gardening."
