It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, silvery-green leaves covered in dense, woolly hairs. The plant produces purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Cirsium subfloccosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
