    "intro": "Corybas cyclopensis, commonly known as the Cyclops hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its unique, hood-like flower that resembles a small cup, typically ranging in color from yellow to orange. The plant has a short, fleshy rhizome and produces a single, showy flower per stem. It thrives in damp, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. The species is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism, attracting flies with its strong odor and dark, hooded structure."
