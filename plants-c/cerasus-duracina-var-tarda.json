    "intro": "Cerasus duracina var. tarda, commonly known as the late cherry, is a botanical variant of the cherry species native to certain regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delayed flowering and fruiting cycle, which typically occurs later in the growing season compared to other cherry varieties. The plant produces small, dark red fruits that are often used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it prefers well-drained soils in temperate climates. Due to its unique blooming pattern, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists studying plant adaptation and phenology."
