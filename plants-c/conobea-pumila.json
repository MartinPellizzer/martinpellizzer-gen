    "intro": "Conobea pumila, commonly known as the dwarf conobea, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to South America. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its delicate nature, it is not commonly cultivated outside its native habitat."
