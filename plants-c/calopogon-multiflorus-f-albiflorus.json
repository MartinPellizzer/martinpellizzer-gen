    "intro": "Calopogon multiflorus f. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered bog orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States, where it thrives in acidic, boggy environments. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, white flowers with a distinctive yellow-green throat. Its unique floral structure and coloration are adaptations to its specialized habitat. The albiflorus form is distinguished by its pure white petals, contrasting with the more common pink or red varieties of the species."
