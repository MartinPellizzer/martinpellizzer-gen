    "intro": "Cyathea myriotricha, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in dense, fibrous roots and a crown of large, feathery fronds. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is typically found in tropical rainforests. Its fronds can reach lengths of up to 3 meters, and the plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Cyathea myriotricha plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat and contributing to forest structure."
