    "intro": "Crepis semnanensis, commonly known as the Semnan hairgrass, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Iran, specifically the Semnan province, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow disc florets surrounded by white ray florets. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
