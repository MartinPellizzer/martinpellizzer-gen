    "intro": "Corybas villosus, commonly known as the hairy helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Australia. It is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped flower that is often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are usually greenish-brown or reddish in color, with a distinct, spurred lip. Corybas villosus is known for its specialized pollination mechanism, relying on flies rather than bees."
