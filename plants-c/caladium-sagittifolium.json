It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves that come in shades of green, red, and white. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant foliage. Caladium sagittifolium is typically grown from tubers and can be propagated through division during the dormant season."
