    "intro": "Cenolophon macrostephanum, commonly known as the large-stephanum cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. Its reproductive structures include a large, cone-like strobilus that produces both male and female spores. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
