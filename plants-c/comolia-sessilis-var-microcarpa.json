    "intro": "Comolia sessilis var. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited comolia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species within the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, pale green leaves that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a petiole. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its fruits are also diminutive, which is reflected in its scientific name \"microcarpa,\" meaning \"small fruit.\" This variety is often found in specific habitats, such as rocky soils or dry woodlands, where it thrives in nutrient-poor conditions."
