    "intro": "Cenchrus ciliaris f. rigidifolius, commonly known as the rigid-leaf buffalo grass, is a variant of the annual grass species native to warm climates. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, rigid leaves that are typically shorter and stiffer than those of the typical form. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used for erosion control and as a forage crop. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
