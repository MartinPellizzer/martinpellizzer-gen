    "intro": "Chaeturus fasciculatus subsp. prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate chaeturas, is a low-growing perennial plant native to specific regions of South America. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its compact growth habit, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening for ground cover."
