It is a small to medium-sized tree that thrives in brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests. The plant has distinctive, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy coating. Its small, white flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed. Ceriops tagal plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
