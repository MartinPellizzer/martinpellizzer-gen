It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne on long, slender pedicels. Its foliage is often aromatic and can be used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable ornamental plant in arid or semi-arid regions."
