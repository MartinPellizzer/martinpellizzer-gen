It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and alternate, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in sagebrush habitats. Chenopodina altissima is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
