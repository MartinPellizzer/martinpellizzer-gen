It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has simple, opposite, ovate leaves with smooth margins and a glossy surface. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Calyptranthes marmeladensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to humid, tropical climates."
