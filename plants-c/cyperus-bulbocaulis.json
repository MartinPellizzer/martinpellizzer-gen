    "intro": "Cyperus bulbocaulis, commonly known as the bulbous flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a rhizomatous root system and produces dense clusters of grass-like leaves that are often submerged or emergent in wetland habitats. The plant's most distinctive feature is its swollen, bulb-like stem base, which stores water and nutrients. It blooms with small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically found in wet soils or standing water. Cyperus bulbocaulis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
