    "intro": "Carya tomentosa var. integrifolia, commonly known as the sugar hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and alternate, pinnately compound leaves with serrated margins. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by edible, sweet, chestnut-like nuts enclosed in spiny husks. Its wood is highly valued for its strength and workability, making it a popular choice for furniture and cabinetry. The plant plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
