    "intro": "Cyperus pelophilus f. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf swamp cyperus, is a compact, low-growing plant native to wetland environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in height, making it well-suited for boggy or marshy habitats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in areas with standing water. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective ground cover in aquatic landscapes."
