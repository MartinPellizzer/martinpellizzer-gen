    "intro": "Chelidonium laciniatum, commonly known as the cutleaf greater celandine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae, which includes\u7f42\u7c9f (poppy) species, and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and milky sap. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often have a distinctive, wavy appearance, while its flowers are arranged in clusters at the top of the plant. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed and is not commonly cultivated for ornamental or medicinal purposes."
