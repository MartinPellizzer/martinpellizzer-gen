    "intro": "Chloris pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf panicgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pale green or blue in color. The plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use in native gardens and erosion control. Chloris pumilio is an important component of the flora in its native habitat, contributing to local biodiversity."
