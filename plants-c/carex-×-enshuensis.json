    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 enshuensis, commonly known as the Enshu sedge, is a hybrid plant species native to Japan. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. Carex \u00d7 enshuensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland habitats."
