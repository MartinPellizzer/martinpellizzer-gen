    "intro": "Crocodilodes fruticosa, commonly known as the coral tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and striking clusters of bright red or orange flowers that bloom throughout the warmer months. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Crocodilodes fruticosa is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient and ornamental species in landscaping."
