    "intro": "Ctenium newtonii var. annuum, commonly known as the annual ctenium, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a pungent odor, while the small white or greenish flowers appear in clusters. This variant is distinguished from other ctenium species by its annual life cycle and specific geographic distribution."
