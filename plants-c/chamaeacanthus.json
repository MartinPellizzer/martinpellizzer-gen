    "intro": "Chamaeacanthus, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Melanthiaceae. It is characterized by its perennial herbaceous growth habit and features showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs. Native to regions of Europe and Asia, Chamaeacanthus species are often found in woodland and meadow habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
