    "intro": "Cyathea dejecta, commonly known as the depressed tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizome system is robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
