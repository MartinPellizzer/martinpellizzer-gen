    "intro": "Cerastium szowitsii var. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features prostrate or ascending stems covered with small, rounded, glabrous (hairless) leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its compact growth and ornamental flowers, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
