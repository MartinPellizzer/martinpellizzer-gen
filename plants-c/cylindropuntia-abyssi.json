It is a spineless, columnar cactus that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features a cylindrical stem with a ribbed structure, which helps it store water efficiently. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, blooming in the spring or early summer. The plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
