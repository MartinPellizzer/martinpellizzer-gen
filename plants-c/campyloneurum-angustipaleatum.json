    "intro": "Campyloneurum angustipaleatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often clustered closely together. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates and in shaded, humid environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
