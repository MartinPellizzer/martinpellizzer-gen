    "intro": "Caroxylon ceresicum, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Andes, is a striking aquatic plant native to the high-altitude lakes of South America. It features large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a subtle fragrance. The plant has broad, waxy leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor it to the lakebed. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in Andean wetland ecosystems. Caroxylon ceresicum is also culturally significant to indigenous communities, who regard it as a symbol of purity and spiritual renewal."
