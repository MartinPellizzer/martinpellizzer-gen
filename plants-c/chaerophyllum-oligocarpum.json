It is characterized by its basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia, often found in woodland and grassland habitats. It produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which release two one-seeded halves upon maturity. The species is known for its ecological importance, providing nectar for various pollinators."
