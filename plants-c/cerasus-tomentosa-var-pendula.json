    "intro": "Cerasus tomentosa var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping cherry or weeping peach, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its cascading branches that create a distinctive, umbrella-like shape. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in spring, typically pink or white, followed by edible, yellowish fruits. Its foliage is deciduous, turning yellow in autumn before falling. The weeping cherry is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens and parks."
