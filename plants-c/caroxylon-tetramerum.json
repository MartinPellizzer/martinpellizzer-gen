    "intro": "Caroxylon tetramerum, commonly known as the four-merous caroxylon, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Baryales. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a woody stem with a distinct, segmented structure. The plant exhibits a complex arrangement of leaves and reproductive structures, which are adapted to its specific ecological niche. Caroxylon tetramerum is primarily found in arid and semi-arid regions, where it plays a minor but significant role in local ecosystems. Due to its rarity and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research."
