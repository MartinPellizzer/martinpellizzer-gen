It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. It produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule. Clidemia longifolia is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and stream banks."
