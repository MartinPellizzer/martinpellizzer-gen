    "intro": "Carlomohria parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered carlomohria, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its delicate, small flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Carlomohria parviflora is considered a species of conservation concern."
