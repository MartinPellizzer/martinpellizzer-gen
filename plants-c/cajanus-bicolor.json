    "intro": "Cajanus bicolor, commonly known as pigeonpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated pods containing 2\u20134 kidney-shaped seeds, which are rich in protein and nutrients. Pigeonpea is well adapted to drought conditions and is often grown as a sustainable crop in semi-arid areas. Its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen makes it an important crop for soil fertility improvement."
