It is characterized by its clusters of small, bright purple to blue berries that persist through winter, making it visually striking. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape with a slightly serrated margin. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. The berries are edible for birds and some mammals, contributing to its ecological importance in its native habitat."
