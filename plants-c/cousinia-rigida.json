    "intro": "Cousinia rigida, commonly known as the rigid cudweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a dense, cylindrical inflorescence, typically blooming in spring. Its fibrous roots allow it to anchor firmly in rocky or sandy soils, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Cousinia rigida is often found in steppe and desert scrub habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
