    "intro": "Cuscuta indica, commonly known as the Indian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is widespread in warm climates and can infest a variety of agricultural crops. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, making it a persistent weed. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly reduce the growth and yield of its host plants."
