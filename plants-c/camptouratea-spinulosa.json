    "intro": "Camptouratea spinulosa, commonly known as the spiny camptouratea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many species of shrubs and vines. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, clustered leaves with a glossy surface. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with five petals and prominent stamens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
