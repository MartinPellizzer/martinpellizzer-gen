    "intro": "Ceanothus verrucosus var. grandifolius, commonly known as the large-leaf ceanothus, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant blue or violet flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in arid and Mediterranean climates."
