It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking red and yellow flowers with prominent spurred petals. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Caulinia coccinea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
