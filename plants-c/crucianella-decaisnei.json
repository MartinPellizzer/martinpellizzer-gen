It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap microscopic organisms. This plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and ditches. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in nutrient-poor environments. The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for small aquatic life."
