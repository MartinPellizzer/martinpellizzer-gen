    "intro": "Commicarpus mistus, commonly known as the narrowleaf commicarpus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
