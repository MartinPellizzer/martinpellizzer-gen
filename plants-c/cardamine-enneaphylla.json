    "intro": "Cardamine enneaphylla, commonly known as the nine-leaf watercress, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and small, white or greenish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery taste similar to other members of the mustard family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
