    "intro": "Chylismia walkeri, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand. It grows on the branches of host trees, primarily pines and kahikatea, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized roots called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are an important food source for native birds. Its leaves are usually scale-like and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Chylismia walkeri plays a unique ecological role in its habitat, contributing to the biodiversity of New Zealand's forests."
