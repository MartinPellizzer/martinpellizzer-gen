    "intro": "Caralluma chrysostephana, commonly known as the golden stem or yellow stem cactus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Nyctaginaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of succulent plants. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in full sun with minimal water, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Caralluma chrysostephana is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
