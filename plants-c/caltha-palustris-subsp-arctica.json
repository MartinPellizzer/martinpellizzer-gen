It typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in vulnerable environments."
