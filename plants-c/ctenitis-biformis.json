    "intro": "Ctenitis biformis, commonly known as the two-lobed ctenitis, is a species of marine algae belonging to the family Cystophycaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, branched thallus that forms a dense, bushy structure. The plant exhibits a complex morphology with a central axis and lateral branches that bear spore-bearing structures called conceptacles. It thrives in shallow, warm coastal waters, often found on rocky substrates. Its reproductive structures are specialized for dispersal via water currents, facilitating its spread in marine environments."
