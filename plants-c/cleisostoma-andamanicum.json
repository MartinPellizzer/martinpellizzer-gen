It features a slender, wiry stem and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
