    "intro": "Carex lepidocarpa var. turgida, commonly known as the woolly sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, cylindrical spike that bears small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wet environments."
