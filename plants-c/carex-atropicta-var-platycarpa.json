    "intro": "Carex atropicta var. platycarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruited bog sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spikelets that are often clustered in elongated, cylindrical inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, typically found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are generally dark green and have a slightly waxy texture, while the flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in tight clusters. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
