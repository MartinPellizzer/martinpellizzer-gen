    "intro": "Ceratopetalum corymbosum, commonly known as the mountain snowbush, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. Ceratopetalum corymbosum is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
