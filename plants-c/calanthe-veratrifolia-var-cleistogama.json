    "intro": "Calanthe veratrifolia var. cleistogama, commonly known as the cleistogamous calanthe, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique cleistogamous flowering habit, where flowers are closed and self-pollinate without opening. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, favoring well-drained, humus-rich soils. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
