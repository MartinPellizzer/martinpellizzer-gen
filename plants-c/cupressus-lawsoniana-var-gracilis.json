    "intro": "Cupressus lawsoniana var. gracilis, commonly known as the Leyland cypress, is a cultivar of the Lawson cypress, characterized by its narrow, columnar growth habit. It features scale-like leaves that are closely packed, giving the plant a dense, feathery appearance. The cones are small and woody, typically containing two to three seeds. It is native to the western United States and is often used in landscaping for its rapid growth and ornamental value. However, it is susceptible to diseases such as cytospora canker and root rot, which can affect its longevity."
