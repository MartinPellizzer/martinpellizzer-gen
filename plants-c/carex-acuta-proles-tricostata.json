    "intro": "Carex acuta proles tricostata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, grass-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and damp woodlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat for aquatic organisms."
