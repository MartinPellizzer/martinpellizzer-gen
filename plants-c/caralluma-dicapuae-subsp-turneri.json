    "intro": "Caralluma dicapuae subsp. turneri, commonly known as the Desert Caper or Turner's Caper, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of India and Pakistan. It belongs to the family Nyctaginaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the rainy season, followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration. This species is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic applications."
