    "intro": "Cuscuta fruticum, commonly known as dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize new hosts easily. Dodder can infest a wide range of plants, including crops, ornamentals, and wild vegetation. Its presence often weakens the host plant, reducing its growth and yield."
