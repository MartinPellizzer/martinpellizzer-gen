    "intro": "Coluteocarpus boissieri, commonly known as the African spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves with a hairy surface and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it has a shallow root system adapted to drought conditions. Coluteocarpus boissieri is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive foliage and resilience."
