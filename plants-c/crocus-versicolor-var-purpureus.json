It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often with a distinctive violet or purple hue. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, making it a striking early-season flower. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that appear after the flowers have faded. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
