    "intro": "Ceanothus \u00d7 pallidus f. plenus, commonly known as the full-flowered palo verde, is a hybrid shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, bright green foliage and clusters of fragrant, pale blue to lavender flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil make it a valuable plant for erosion control. The full-flowered form distinguishes it from other ceanothus species by its more abundant and showy blooms."
