    "intro": "Cordia hebecarpa, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly pubescent underside. The plant produces showy, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits that split open to release small, black seeds. It is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats across its range."
