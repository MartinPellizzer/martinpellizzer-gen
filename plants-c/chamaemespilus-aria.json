    "intro": "Chamaemespilus aria, commonly known as the white-flowered hornbeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by small, red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas. Chamaemespilus aria is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
