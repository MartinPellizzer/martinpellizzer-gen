    "intro": "Cereus calcirupicola var. albicans, commonly known as the white-flowered rock cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
