    "intro": "Crotalaria pseudotenuirama, commonly known as the narrow-leaf crotalaria, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its slender, pinnately compound leaves and yellow flowers with distinctive spurred petals. The plant produces cylindrical, woody pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a common weed in agricultural areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is sometimes avoided in livestock grazing areas."
