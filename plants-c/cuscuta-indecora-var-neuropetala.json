    "intro": "Cuscuta indecora var. neuropetala, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to North America and is often found on a variety of herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants, making it both a nuisance and a subject of ecological study."
