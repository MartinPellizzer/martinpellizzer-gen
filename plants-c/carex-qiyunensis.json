    "intro": "Carex qiyunensis, commonly known as the Qiyun sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to China and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the sedge family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.
