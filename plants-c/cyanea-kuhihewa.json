    "intro": "Cyanea kuhihewa, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 Cyanea, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers. The plant is typically found growing in the shaded, moist environments of the Haleakal\u0101 volcano's summit. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces flowers that bloom in early spring. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cyanea kuhihewa is considered critically endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
