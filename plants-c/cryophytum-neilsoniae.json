    "intro": "Cryophytum neilsoniae, commonly known as the Antarctic hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the cold environments of Antarctica. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to extreme cold and low light conditions. Cryophytum neilsoniae plays a minor but ecologically significant role in the sparse vegetation of Antarctic ecosystems."
