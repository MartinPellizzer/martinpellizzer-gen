    "intro": "Coix sulcata, commonly known as the Chinese sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to East Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that develop into three-lobed, spiky fruits. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in wet or marshy environments, making it a common sight in wetlands and rice paddies. Coix sulcata is also valued for its edible seeds, which are used in traditional Chinese cuisine and medicine. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats, with rhizomes that help anchor it in muddy soils."
