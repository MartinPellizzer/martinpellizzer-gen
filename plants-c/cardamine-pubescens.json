    "intro": "Cardamine pubescens, commonly known as hairy watercress, is a small flowering plant native to moist, often shaded environments in temperate regions. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other cruciferous plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its root system is fibrous, and it spreads through both seeds and rhizomes. Hairy watercress is often found near streams, marshes, and woodland edges, where it thrives in wet, nutrient-rich soils."
