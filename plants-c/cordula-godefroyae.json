    "intro": "Cordula godefroyae, commonly known as the Godefroy's cordula, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feather-like leaves. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and ecological role within its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
