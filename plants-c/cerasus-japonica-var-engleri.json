    "intro": "Cerasus japonica var. engleri, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or Prunus engleri, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its ornamental value, particularly during the spring when it produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant has elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to the blossoms. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes. The fruit, though not widely cultivated for consumption, is edible and resembles a small cherry in appearance."
