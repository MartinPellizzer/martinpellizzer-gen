    "intro": "Carex brunnescens subsp. sphaerostachya, commonly known as the golden sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces distinctive, spherical spikelets that are often golden in color. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along the edges of ponds and streams. It has narrow, cylindrical leaves that are usually a dark green color, and it is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. The subspecies sphaerostachya is notable for its unique inflorescence structure, which sets it apart from other Carex species."
