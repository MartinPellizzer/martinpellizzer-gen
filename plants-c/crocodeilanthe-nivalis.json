    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe nivalis, commonly known as the snow fern, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant native to high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in cloud forests. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth form with small, scale-like leaves that help retain moisture. Its reproductive structures are inconspicuous, relying on wind pollination for fertilization. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Crocodeilanthe nivalis is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
