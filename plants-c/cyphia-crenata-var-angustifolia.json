It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
