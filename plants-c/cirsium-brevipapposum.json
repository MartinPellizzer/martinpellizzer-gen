    "intro": "Cirsium brevipapposum, commonly known as the short-pappus thistle, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to the western United States, particularly found in California and Oregon, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its spiny, hairy leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. It produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by the wind, a common adaptation in arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
