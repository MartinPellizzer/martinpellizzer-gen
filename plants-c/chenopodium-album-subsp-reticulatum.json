    "intro": "Chenopodium album subsp. reticulatum, commonly known as prickly goosefoot, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit and hairy, alternate leaves with a distinctive reticulate venation pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. This subspecies is known for its edible leaves, though they may contain oxalic acid and should be consumed with caution."
