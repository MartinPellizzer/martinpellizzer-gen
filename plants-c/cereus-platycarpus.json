    "intro": "Cereus platycarpus, commonly known as the giant night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. The plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
