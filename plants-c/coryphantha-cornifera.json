    "intro": "Coryphantha cornifera, commonly known as the horned cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sun exposure. Coryphantha cornifera is well adapted to desert conditions, with a shallow root system that allows it to absorb moisture efficiently."
