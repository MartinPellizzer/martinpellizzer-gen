    "intro": "Cyrtomium balansae, commonly known as the Balansae holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often recurved. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, and can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Cyrtomium balansae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
