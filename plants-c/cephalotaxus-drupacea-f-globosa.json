    "intro": "Cephalotaxus drupacea f. globosa, commonly known as the globular yew, is a unique cultivar of the yew plant characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit. It features small, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed, giving the plant a compact and ornamental appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green berries that are typically not edible for humans but may be consumed by certain wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for garden use as a specimen plant. This form is prized for its slow growth and evergreen foliage, which provides year-round visual interest."
