It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense, low-growing clumps. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture with a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or coastal landscapes."
