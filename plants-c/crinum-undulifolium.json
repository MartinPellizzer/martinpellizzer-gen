    "intro": "Crinum undulifolium, commonly known as the wavy-leaved crinum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, wavy-edged leaves that are typically broad and lance-shaped. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often arranged in clusters at the top of the stem. Its bulbs are underground and serve as storage organs, allowing the plant to survive dry periods. Crinum undulifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
