    "intro": "Chaerophyllum palustre, commonly known as marsh parsley, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and moist soils in Europe and Asia. It features a basal rosette of finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a white powdery coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in poorly drained soils and is often found near streams, marshes, and damp meadows. Due to its preference for wet habitats, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
