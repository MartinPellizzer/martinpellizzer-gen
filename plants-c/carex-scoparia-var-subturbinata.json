    "intro": "Carex scoparia var. subturbinata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and it produces small, clustered spikes of flowers in the summer. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Carex scoparia."
