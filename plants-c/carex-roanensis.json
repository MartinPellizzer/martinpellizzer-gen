    "intro": "Carex roanensis, commonly known as Roan sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, bogs, and stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. Carex roanensis is often found in shaded environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
