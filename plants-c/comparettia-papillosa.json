    "intro": "Comparettia papillosa, commonly known as the papillate orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its striking, hairy (papillate) leaves and vibrant, butterfly-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers, which can be yellow, orange, or red, are highly fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The botanical features of Comparettia papillosa make it a unique and visually appealing addition to botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
