    "intro": "Cistus ocymoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves and flowers, are used in perfumes and traditional medicine. Cistus ocymoides plays a vital role in preventing soil erosion in its native habitats."
