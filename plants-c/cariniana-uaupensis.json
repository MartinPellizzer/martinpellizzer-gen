    "intro": "Cariniana uaupensis, commonly known as the Brazilian chestnut, is a large evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its thick, ridged bark and large, glossy leaves. The tree produces edible fruits that are encased in a hard, spiny shell, similar to those of the chestnut genus. Its wood is highly valued for its strength and durability, making it important for both ecological and economic reasons. However, the species is now critically endangered due to habitat loss and overexploitation."
