    "intro": "Cerastium schmidtianum var. angustilobum, commonly known as narrow-leaved mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical variety, and it produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions."
