    "intro": "Coleus macranthus var. crispipilus, commonly known as the crinkled coleus, is a striking ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, multicolored foliage with a unique crinkled or ruffled texture. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and display shades of red, purple, and green, creating a visually appealing contrast. This variety thrives in partial shade and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for garden borders and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to produce small, tubular flowers in shades of purple or white during the growing season."
