    "intro": "Claytonia triangularis, commonly known as the mountain sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are heart-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to rocky or alpine habitats. Claytonia triangularis thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and forested areas. Its botanical features make it a notable species in the Portulacaceae family."
