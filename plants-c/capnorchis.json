    "intro": "Capnorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and fascinating orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a unique appearance, with long, slender leaves and a single, delicate flower that resembles a ghostly figure. Capnorchis thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to survive. Due to its rarity and habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
