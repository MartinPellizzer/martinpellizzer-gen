    "intro": "Chenopodiopsis hirta, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Chenopodiopsis hirta plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
