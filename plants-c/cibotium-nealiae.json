The plant belongs to the family Dicksoniaceae and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting pollinators. Cibotium nealiae plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
