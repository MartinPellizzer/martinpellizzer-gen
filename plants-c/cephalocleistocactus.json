    "intro": "Cephalocleistocactus, commonly known as the \"humpback cactus,\" is a rare and unique species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, thick, ribbed stems that form a rounded, almost globular shape. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the late afternoon, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. Its botanical features include a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
