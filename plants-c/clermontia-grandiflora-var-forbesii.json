It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. It has heart-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
