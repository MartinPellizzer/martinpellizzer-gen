    "intro": "Cistus sideritis, commonly known as iron thyme, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the rockrose family (Cistaceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, shrub-like form. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are aromatic and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Cistus sideritis is often found in rocky soils and is well adapted to coastal and mountainous environments."
