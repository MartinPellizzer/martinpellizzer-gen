    "intro": "Caucalis, commonly known as the \"snowy bellflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, bell-shaped flowers that often display a white or pale blue hue. They typically grow in temperate regions and are often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Caucalis species are herbaceous perennials, with some varieties exhibiting trailing or upright growth habits. Their botanical features include hairy stems, small ovate leaves, and flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
