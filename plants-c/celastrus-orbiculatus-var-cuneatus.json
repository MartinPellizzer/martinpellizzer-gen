    "intro": "Celastrus orbiculatus var. cuneatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are usually narrower than those of the typical C. orbiculatus. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
