    "intro": "Carex bistaminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in spikelets, typical of the sedge family."
