    "intro": "Cussonia holstii f. integrifoliola, commonly known as the smooth-leaved cussonia, is a variant of the original species Cussonia holstii. It is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa, characterized by its smooth, broad leaves that are typically entire or slightly lobed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by dark blue, spherical berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections for its attractive foliage and resilience."
