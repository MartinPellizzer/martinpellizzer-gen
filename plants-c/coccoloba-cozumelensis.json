    "intro": "Coccoloba cozumelensis, commonly known as the Cozumel beautyberry, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the Caribbean, specifically the island of Cozumel in Mexico, where it thrives in coastal and limestone habitats. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. It produces bright red berries that are edible for some bird species but toxic to humans. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
