    "intro": "Cynanchum nanum, commonly known as small milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its latex contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores. Cynanchum nanum is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges."
