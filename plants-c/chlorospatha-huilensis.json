    "intro": "Chlorospatha huilensis, commonly known as the Huil\u00e9n sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow ray florets and dark brown disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
