    "intro": "Cissus obliqua, commonly known as the rock fig or climbing fig, is a trailing or climbing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its succulent, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig-like fruits that are typically red or yellow when ripe. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Cissus obliqua is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to cascade from hanging baskets or trellises."
