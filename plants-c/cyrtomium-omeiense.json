    "intro": "Cyrtomium omeiense, commonly known as the Omeiense water fern, is a species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lobed fronds that are typically green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat. Cyrtomium omeiense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
