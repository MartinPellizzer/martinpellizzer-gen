It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and showy, yellow to orange flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh desert conditions, with deep roots and thick leaves that help conserve water. It typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in crevices or along dry streambeds. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
