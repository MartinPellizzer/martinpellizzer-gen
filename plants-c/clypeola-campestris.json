It is characterized by its spiral shell, which is typically light to dark brown in color. This species is often found in moist environments such as gardens, fields, and woodland areas. Clypeola campestris plays a role in nutrient cycling by feeding on decaying plant matter. Its presence can indicate a healthy ecosystem due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
