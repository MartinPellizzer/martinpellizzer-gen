    "intro": "Croton wigmannii, commonly known as the Hawaiian croton, is a tropical shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from green to red and yellow. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
