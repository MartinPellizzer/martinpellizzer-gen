    "intro": "Centella coriacea, commonly known as stonecrop centella, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are often covered with a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. Centella coriacea is also known for its medicinal properties, with traditional uses in treating skin conditions and promoting wound healing."
