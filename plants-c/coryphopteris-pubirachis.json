    "intro": "Coryphopteris pubirachis, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in soil or substrates. The fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying and being replaced by new growth."
