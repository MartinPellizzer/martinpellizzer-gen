    "intro": "Caesalpinia crista, commonly known as the crown flower, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky, red or orange inflorescences that resemble a crown, hence its common name. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant appearance. Caesalpinia crista is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
