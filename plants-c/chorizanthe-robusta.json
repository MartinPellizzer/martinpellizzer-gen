    "intro": "Chorizanthe robusta, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, spiny foliage. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a hard, leathery capsule, which helps protect them from desiccation in arid environments. Chorizanthe robusta is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
