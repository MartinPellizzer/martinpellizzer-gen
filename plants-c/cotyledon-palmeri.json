    "intro": "Cotyledon palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, typically during the spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Cotyledon palmeri is also known for its ability to store water in its leaves, allowing it to survive in drought conditions."
