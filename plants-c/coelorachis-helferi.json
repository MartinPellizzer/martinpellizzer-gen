    "intro": "Coelorachis helferi, commonly known as the Helfer's spider orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, spider-like inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, intricate flowers with a distinctive, intricate pattern of purple and yellow. It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing in dense undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Coelorachis helferi is considered a vulnerable species."
