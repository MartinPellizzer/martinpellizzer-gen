    "intro": "Cheilanthes pteridioides subsp. maderensis, commonly known as the Mader's rockcap, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, terrestrial fern that thrives in rocky, arid environments, often growing on limestone or sandstone. The plant has a short, rhizomatous stem with a dense, compact frond that is typically gray-green in color. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it is well adapted to drought conditions. This subspecies is notable for its resilience and is often found in crevices and on exposed rock surfaces."
