    "intro": "Cryptantha muriculata, commonly known as the rough cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, while its fruit is a dry, dehiscent pod. Cryptantha muriculata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
