    "intro": "Cereus rostratus, commonly known as the Easter cactus, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its segmented, jointed stems that resemble those of other cacti. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in spring, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight to flourish. Cereus rostratus is also known for its ability to store water in its stems, making it relatively drought-tolerant."
