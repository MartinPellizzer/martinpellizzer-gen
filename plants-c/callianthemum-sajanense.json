    "intro": "Callianthemum sajanense, commonly known as the Sajanense globeflower, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and vibrant, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, making it a notable species in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
