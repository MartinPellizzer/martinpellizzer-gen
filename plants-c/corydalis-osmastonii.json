    "intro": "Corydalis osmastonii, commonly known as the Osmaston's corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, often pink or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and has a tuberous root system typical of many Corydalis species. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
