    "intro": "Corunastylis cuspidata, commonly known as the sharp-tipped star sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist, sandy soils. Corunastylis cuspidata is often found in swampy areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
