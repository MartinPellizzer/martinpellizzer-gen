    "intro": "Castilleja \u00d7 porterae, commonly known as the hybrid Indian paintbrush, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on host plants for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces striking red, orange, or yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to the western United States and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Due to its ecological role and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
