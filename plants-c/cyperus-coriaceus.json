    "intro": "Cyperus coriaceus, commonly known as hardleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Cyperus coriaceus produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated."
