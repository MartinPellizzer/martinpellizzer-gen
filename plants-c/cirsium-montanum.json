    "intro": "Cirsium montanum, commonly known as mountain thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky, or alpine habitats and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant features a sturdy, upright stem covered in rough, spiny hairs, and its leaves are deeply lobed with a rough, sometimes sticky texture. Its flowers are purple to violet in color, forming dense, spherical clusters known as heads, which are characteristic of the Asteraceae family. The plant produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize open, disturbed areas."
