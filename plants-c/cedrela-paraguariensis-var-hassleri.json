    "intro": "Cedrela paraguariensis var. hassleri, commonly known as the Paraguayan rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, leathery seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in many regions."
