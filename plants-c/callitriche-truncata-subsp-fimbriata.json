    "intro": "Callitriche truncata subsp. fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed water-starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, often in muddy or sandy substrates. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged, with the upper leaves sometimes floating on the water surface. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and it produces small, oval fruits. This species is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along the edges of ponds and streams."
