    "intro": "Carex laxiflora var. patulifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands, where it thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. The plant features slender, grass-like stems with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
