    "intro": "Chamaecytisus ciliatus subsp. elongatus, commonly known as the longleaf buckthorn, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue-black berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
