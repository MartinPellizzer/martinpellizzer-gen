    "intro": "Carex badia, commonly known as the black sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, sword-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, spike-like flowers. Native to wetland and marshy habitats, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and is often found in temperate regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation in suitable environments."
