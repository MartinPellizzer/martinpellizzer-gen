    "intro": "Corymbia polysciada, commonly known as the Sydney red gum, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to eastern Australia, particularly the coastal regions of New South Wales and Queensland. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall, featuring smooth, grey bark that peels in strips. Its flowers are small, pinkish-white, and clustered in loose inflorescences, blooming in spring. The wood of Corymbia polysciada is hard and durable, historically valued for its use in construction and furniture-making."
