    "intro": "Cirrhaea viridipurpurea var. fryana, commonly known as the Fryan violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to the temperate regions of North America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are a striking blend of green and purple, often with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of violet and white, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical significance lies in its unique coloration and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
