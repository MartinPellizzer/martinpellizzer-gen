    "intro": "Cyrtogonellum simile, commonly known as the slender false orchid, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family, though it is not a true orchid, and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, often clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks and in wetlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
