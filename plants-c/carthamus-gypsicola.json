It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, showing a high tolerance for drought and poor soil conditions. Its leaves are usually gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and it produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Carthamus gypsicola is often used in traditional medicine and has been studied for its potential phytochemical properties."
