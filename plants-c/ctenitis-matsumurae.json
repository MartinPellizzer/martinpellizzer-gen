    "intro": "Ctenitis matsumurae, commonly known as the Japanese tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a tall, tree-like fern that can grow up to 10 meters in height, with a stout, unbranched trunk covered in persistent, fibrous roots. The plant features a crown of large, pinnately compound fronds that are often arched or drooping. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in sori, which are clustered in groups called sorangia. Ctenitis matsumurae thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
