    "intro": "Ceanothus integerrimus, commonly known as the Coast Range ceanothus, is a flowering shrub native to the western United States. It typically grows in coastal and inland regions, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is evergreen, with leathery, gray-green leaves that provide year-round interest. Ceanothus integerrimus is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
