    "intro": "Carex adusta var. congesta, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a perennial sedge characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and striking violet-pink flower heads. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and heathlands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green with a purplish tinge along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland environments."
