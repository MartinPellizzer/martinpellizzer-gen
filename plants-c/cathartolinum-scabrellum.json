    "intro": "Cathartolinum scabrellum, commonly known as the rough-skin cathartolinum, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater. Despite its resilience, it is considered a rare species due to habitat loss and overharvesting."
