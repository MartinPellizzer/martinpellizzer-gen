    "intro": "Carex oliveri, commonly known as Oliver's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. Native to certain regions of North America, it typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Carex oliveri plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
