    "intro": "Carex stricta subsp. turfosa, commonly known as tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and forms tussocks or clumps, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wet to moist habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Its leaves are usually dark green and stiff, with a prominent midrib. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family."
