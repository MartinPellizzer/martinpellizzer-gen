    "intro": "Catevala laetevirens, commonly known as the golden vining plant, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a glossy, dark green surface and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its stems are woody and can develop thorns, which help in climbing and deterring herbivores. Catevala laetevirens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
