    "intro": "Celastrus versicolor, commonly known as the variable bindweed, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically green on top and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, often dispersed by wind. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to climb various structures, making it both ornamental and invasive in some regions."
