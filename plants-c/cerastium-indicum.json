    "intro": "Cerastium indicum, commonly known as the Indian chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae). It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Cerastium indicum is native to temperate regions of Asia and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils."
