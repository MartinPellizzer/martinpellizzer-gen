    "intro": "Collabiopsis chlorantha, commonly known as the green mossy lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its dense, greenish-yellow thallus that often forms a carpet-like growth on rocks or soil. The plant lacks distinct leaves but has a complex structure with a cortex and medulla layer. It reproduces through the release of spores from its apothecia, which are small, disk-shaped structures. This lichen is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollutants."
