It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and spiny, ribbed structure. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Its unique nocturnal blooming habit makes it a popular choice for collectors and gardeners."
