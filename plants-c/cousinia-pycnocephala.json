    "intro": "Cousinia pycnocephala, commonly known as the dense-headed cousinia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, dense clusters of small yellow flowers. The plant typically grows from a basal rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. It produces slender, branched stems that bear the flower heads, which are often surrounded by leaf-like bracts. Cousinia pycnocephala is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations."
