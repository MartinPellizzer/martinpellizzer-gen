    "intro": "Cyclosorus multiauriculatus, commonly known as the many-ear moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and the presence of numerous small, ear-shaped lobes on its thallus. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sorocarps, are borne on short stalks and contain spores. Cyclosorus multiauriculatus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
