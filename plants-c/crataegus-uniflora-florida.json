    "intro": "Crataegus uniflora florida, commonly known as the Florida hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its simple, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. The Florida hawthorn is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in native habitats."
