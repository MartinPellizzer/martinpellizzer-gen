    "intro": "Clematis alpina var. macrosepala, commonly known as the alpine clematis, is a perennial vine native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped, hairy leaves. The flowers are typically blue or purple, with large, showy sepals that are often more prominent than the petals. This variety thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers well-drained, fertile soil. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to climb trellises or walls."
