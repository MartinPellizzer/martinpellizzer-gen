    "intro": "Cerastium semidecandrum, commonly known as the five-flowered chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that bear small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces numerous tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Cerastium semidecandrum is also known for its ability to spread through stolons, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil in wetlands."
