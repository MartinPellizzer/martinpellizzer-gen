    "intro": "Cenchrus mutilatus, commonly known as the slender fingergrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as roadsides and pastures. Its fibrous roots contribute to soil stabilization, and it is sometimes used in erosion control. The species is also valued for its potential in forage and as a component in ecological restoration projects."
