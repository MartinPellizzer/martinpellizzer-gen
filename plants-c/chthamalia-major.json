    "intro": "Chthamalia major, commonly known as the giant sea holly, is a species of red algae found primarily in the intertidal zones of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its large, fleshy thalli that can grow up to 30 centimeters in height. The plant has a distinctive branching structure with a central axis and lateral branches that are often covered in small, rounded bumps. It thrives in areas with moderate to strong wave action and requires a stable substrate such as rock or shell. Chthamalia major plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
