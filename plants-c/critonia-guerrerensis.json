It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its water-storing stems. Its flowers bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
