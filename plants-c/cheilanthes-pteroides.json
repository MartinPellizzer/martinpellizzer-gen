    "intro": "Cheilanthes pteroides, commonly known as the rock fern or mountain rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows on rocky substrates in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a short, rhizomatous stem with dense, clustered fronds that are usually leathery and dark green. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions. This fern is often found in regions with limestone or granite soils, such as in parts of North America and Mexico."
