    "intro": "Cocos indica, commonly known as the Indian coconut, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, hairy leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces a fibrous husk surrounding its hard, oval-shaped seed, which is used to make coconuts. The coconut palm is also known for its ability to thrive in coastal areas and salty soils. Its fruit is a vital resource for food, drink, and various industrial products."
