It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold climates. Crocus montanus is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its early blooming habit."
