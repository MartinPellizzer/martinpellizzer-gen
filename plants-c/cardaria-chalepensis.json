    "intro": "Cardaria chalepensis, commonly known as the Persian rocket or wild radish, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is an annual herb that grows up to 1 meter tall, featuring hairy stems and alternate leaves with toothed edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by cylindrical, pale green pods containing several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in wastelands. Its rapid growth and seed dispersal make it an invasive species in some regions."
