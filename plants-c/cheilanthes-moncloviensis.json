    "intro": "Cheilanthes moncloviensis, commonly known as the Monclova rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a small, terrestrial fern that thrives in rocky, arid environments, often growing on limestone substrates. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth habit with thick, leathery fronds that help it retain moisture in its dry habitat. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
