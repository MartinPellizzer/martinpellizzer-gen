    "intro": "Carex pigra, commonly known as the swamp sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense colonies in marshes and along stream banks. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it produces viable seeds that aid in its propagation. Carex pigra plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
