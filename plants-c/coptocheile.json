    "intro": "Coptocheile, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that mature in the fall. Coptocheile thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
