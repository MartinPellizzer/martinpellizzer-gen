    "intro": "Caryopteris, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and is characterized by its aromatic, often fragrant leaves and showy, blue or purple flowers. The plants typically grow as shrubs or subshrubs, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Caryopteris species are valued in gardens for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in full sun with well-drained soil. They are also popular for their ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
