    "intro": "Cistus polymorphus, commonly known as the rough cistus, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic evergreen leaves and showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cistus polymorphus is also known for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
