    "intro": "Coreopsis biternata, commonly known as the three-leaved coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring hairy stems and alternate leaves with three pairs of lobes. The plant produces bright yellow, daisy-like flowers with ray florets and a prominent yellow disk in the center. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plants. Coreopsis biternata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
