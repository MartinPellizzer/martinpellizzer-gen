    "intro": "Cydista decora, commonly known as the showy lady's slipper, is a striking orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, pinkish-purple pouch-like flower that resembles a slipper, which is a unique feature among orchids. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, loamy soils. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it in the forest floor, while its leaves are broad and lance-shaped. Cydista decora plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
