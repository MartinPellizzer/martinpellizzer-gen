    "intro": "Coryanthes javieri, commonly known as the Java hooded orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, hood-like flower structure that encloses the reproductive organs, a feature typical of many coryanthes species. The plant produces large, showy blooms with intricate patterns of red, orange, and yellow, often resembling a crown or helmet. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
