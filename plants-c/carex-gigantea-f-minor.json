    "intro": "Carex gigantea f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf tussock sedge, is a compact, low-growing plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly curled at the tips. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in temperate regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
