    "intro": "Cleyera elegans, commonly known as the silverleaf cleyera, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features lance-shaped leaves that are glossy on top and silver-gray underneath, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that attract birds. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value and ability to tolerate urban conditions make it a popular choice for landscaping."
