It typically grows in wet, boggy habitats and thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often covered in a waxy coating. This variant is distinguished by its adaptability to colder climates and its role in supporting local ecosystems."
