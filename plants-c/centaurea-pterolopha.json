It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, where it thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands. The plant is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture. Centaurea pterolopha is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
