    "intro": "Campanulorchis leiophylla, commonly known as the smooth-leafed bell orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are smooth and lanceolate, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Campanulorchis leiophylla is considered a threatened species in its native range."
