    "intro": "Corynanthera, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Piperaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique, often fragrant flowers that resemble small, ghostly shapes, hence their common name. Corynanthera species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. The flowers are usually small and clustered, with delicate, white or pale-colored petals. They play an important role in pollination, attracting various insects and contributing to the biodiversity of their native habitats."
