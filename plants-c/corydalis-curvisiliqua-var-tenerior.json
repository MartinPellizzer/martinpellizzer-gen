It features delicate, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, wiry stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming habit and compact growth form."
