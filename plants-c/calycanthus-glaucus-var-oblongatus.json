    "intro": "Calycanthus glaucus var. oblongatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sweetshrub, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features aromatic, showy flowers that are typically pinkish-red with a yellowish center, blooming in late spring to early summer. The leaves are elliptical to oblong in shape, with a slightly glossy upper surface and a hairy underside. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaf morphology compared to the typical form of Calycanthus glaucus. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
