It features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to lavender, often with a white throat. The plant has hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate blooms and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
