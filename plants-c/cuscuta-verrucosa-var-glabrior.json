    "intro": "Cuscuta verrucosa var. glabrior, commonly known as the smooth dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and is often found growing on a variety of herbaceous plants. It is native to North America and is considered an invasive species in some regions. Its life cycle involves producing seeds that can remain dormant in the soil for extended periods."
