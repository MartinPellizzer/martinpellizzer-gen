    "intro": "Chamaefistula prominens, commonly known as the Persian lilac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, pale purple to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has greyish bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. The species is closely related to the common lilac but is adapted to drier and more arid climates."
