    "intro": "Coccoloba fastigiata, commonly known as the red mangrove or red bay, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a small evergreen shrub or tree that thrives in coastal areas, particularly in brackish or saline soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often red or reddish in color, which help it withstand salt spray and tidal influences. Its small, white flowers are clustered in inflorescences and are followed by small, round berries. Coccoloba fastigiata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
