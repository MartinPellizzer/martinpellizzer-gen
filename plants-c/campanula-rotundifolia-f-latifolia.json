    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rounded, broad leaves and bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky or woodland habitats and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. The foliage and flowers are also used in traditional herbal medicine for their mild sedative and diuretic properties."
