    "intro": "Castilleja ardifera, commonly known as the sharpleaf paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, red or orange tubular flowers. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Castilleja ardifera plays a role in supporting pollinators and is often found in association with specific host plants."
