    "intro": "Catasetum semicirculatum, commonly known as the Semicircular Catasetum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often feature a distinctive yellow or orange coloration with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers have a unique structure, with a specialized pollination mechanism involving the transfer of pollen via a structure called a \"pollinia.\" This orchid is prized by horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
