    "intro": "Calyptranthes canapuensis, commonly known as the red-leaf calyptranthes, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn a striking red or maroon color during the dry season. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Calyptranthes canapuensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
