    "intro": "Clidemia sessiliflora, commonly known as broadleaf miconia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green and glossy. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understories. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively, it is considered an invasive species in many areas outside its native range."
