    "intro": "Carex depressa subsp. basilaris, commonly known as the basal sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. The plant has grass-like leaves that are usually narrow and dark green, with a distinctive basal rosette formation. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. This subspecies is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
