    "intro": "Corethrogyne filaginifolia var. viscidula, commonly known as the sticky corethrogyne, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a sticky, resinous substance, which is a distinctive botanical characteristic. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique morphology and chemical composition make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
