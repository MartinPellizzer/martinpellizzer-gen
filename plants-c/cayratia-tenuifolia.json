    "intro": "Cayratia tenuifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It features slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses in warmer climates."
