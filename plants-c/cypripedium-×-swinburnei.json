    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 swinburnei, commonly known as the Swinburne's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a deep pink or purple pouch and intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. It has a short, fleshy rhizome and produces a single, large, fragrant flower per stem. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and protected areas."
