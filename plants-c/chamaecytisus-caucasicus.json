It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, dark green leaves. The plant produces yellowish-orange flowers in early spring, followed by small, elliptical berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
