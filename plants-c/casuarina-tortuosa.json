    "intro": "Casuarina tortuosa, commonly known as the coastal she-oak, is a hardy evergreen tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like leaves that are clustered in spirals around the stems. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Casuarina tortuosa is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Its root system helps stabilize dunes and prevent erosion, making it ecologically significant in coastal ecosystems."
