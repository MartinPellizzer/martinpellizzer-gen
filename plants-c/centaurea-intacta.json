    "intro": "Centaurea intacta, commonly known as the upright centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Centaurea intacta is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
