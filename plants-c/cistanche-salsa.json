    "intro": "Cistanche salsa, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic plant that grows primarily in arid and semi-arid regions. It lacks true leaves and chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host plants for nutrients. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers and has a unique structure with a stem that wraps around its host. It is often found in the wild in areas such as China, Mongolia, and the Middle East. Due to its medicinal properties, it is also cultivated for use in traditional herbal remedies."
