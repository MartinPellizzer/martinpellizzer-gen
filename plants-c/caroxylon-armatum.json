    "intro": "Caroxylon armatum, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a robust, fleshy root system adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. Its most distinctive feature is its tall, spire-like inflorescence, which bears showy, white or pale pink flowers. Caroxylon armatum plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing sandy soils."
