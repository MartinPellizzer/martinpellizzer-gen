    "intro": "Cotoneaster fangianus, commonly known as Fang's cotoneaster, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to China and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with dense, thorny branches. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. Cotoneaster fangianus typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in suitable climates."
