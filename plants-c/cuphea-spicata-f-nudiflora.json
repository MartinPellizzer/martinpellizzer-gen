It is characterized by its unique, spike-like inflorescences that bear showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and containers. Its foliage is often variegated, adding visual interest to the landscape. The f. nudiflora form is notable for its lack of bracts, giving it a more delicate appearance compared to other cuphea varieties."
