    "intro": "Cytisus austriacus subsp. heuffelii, commonly known as the Austrian broom, is a shrub native to Central Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is typically found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to sunny environments. It has small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with root nodules. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to colonize disturbed areas."
