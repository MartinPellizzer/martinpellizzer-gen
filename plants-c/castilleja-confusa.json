    "intro": "Castilleja confusa, commonly known as the western prairie bluet, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in open grasslands and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host for various insects and fungi."
