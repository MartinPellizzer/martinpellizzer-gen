It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, creeping stolons that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its flowering occurs in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a bluish-green hue, contributing to its ornamental value in wetland landscapes."
