    "intro": "Carex muricata var. confixa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial sedge native to wetland environments in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly rough texture. The plant produces cylindrical spikelets that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. Its dense growth helps stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
