    "intro": "Callicarpa crassinervis, commonly known as the broad-veined beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with prominent veins, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red,\u6d46\u679c-like berries in the fall. These berries are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally not consumed by humans. Callicarpa crassinervis is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant fruit and attractive foliage."
