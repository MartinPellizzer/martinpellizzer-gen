    "intro": "Crataegus bosciana, commonly known as the Bosiana hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pinkish flowers in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges, and it is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Crataegus bosciana is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local ecosystems."
