    "intro": "Carduus lachnocephalus, commonly known as the purple thistle or death's-head hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, purple-tinged leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils. It has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an invasive species in some areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by grazing animals."
