    "intro": "Cheilanthes ambigua, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in arid and rocky environments, often growing on cliffs or in crevices. The plant has lance-shaped, evergreen leaves that are typically less than a foot in length. It produces spores in clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are adapted for dispersal in dry conditions. Its drought tolerance and unique morphology make it a hardy and resilient species in its native habitat."
