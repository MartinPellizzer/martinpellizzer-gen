    "intro": "Capsicum leptocladum, commonly known as the slender-stemmed chili pepper, is a species native to Central America. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, branching stems and small, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright red, bell-shaped fruits that are typically used in local cuisines. It thrives in warm, tropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated species."
