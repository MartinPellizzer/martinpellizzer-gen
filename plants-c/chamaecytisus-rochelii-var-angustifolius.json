    "intro": "Chamaecytisus rochelii var. angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved broom, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Europe. It features dense, thorny stems that grow close to the ground, forming a low, mat-like structure. The leaves are narrow and leathery, with a grayish-green hue, adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its small, yellow flowers appear in clusters during the spring, adding a bright splash of color to the landscape. This plant is well-suited to coastal environments and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
