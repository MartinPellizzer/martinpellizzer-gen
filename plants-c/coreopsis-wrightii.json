    "intro": "Coreopsis wrightii, commonly known as the eastern blue-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Coreopsis wrightii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
