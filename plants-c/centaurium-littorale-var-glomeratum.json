    "intro": "Centaurium littorale var. glomeratum, commonly known as sea centaury, is a low-growing perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, hairy stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats along sandy or rocky shores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five pointed lobes, typically in shades of pink to purple, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, arranged alternately along the stem, and are covered in fine, soft hairs. This variety is adapted to saline and wind-exposed environments, making it a characteristic component of coastal vegetation."
