It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it a resilient species in coastal and sandy soils. The plant's rapid growth and spreading habit contribute to its role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
