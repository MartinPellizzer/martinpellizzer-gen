    "intro": "Canthium longistipulum, commonly known as the long-styled canthium, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated stamens that often exceed the length of the petals. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five sepals and five petals, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Canthium longistipulum is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands."
