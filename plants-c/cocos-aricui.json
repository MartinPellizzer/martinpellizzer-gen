    "intro": "Cocos aricui, commonly known as the West Indian coconut, is a tropical palm native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces coconuts that are typically smaller and have a sweeter, more delicate flavor compared to the common coconut. Its fruit is enclosed in a fibrous husk and contains a white, fleshy aril around the hard inner shell. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for both its fruit and ornamental value."
