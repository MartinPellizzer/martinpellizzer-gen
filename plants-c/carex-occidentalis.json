    "intro": "Carex occidentalis, commonly known as western sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually green or brown, and it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems. Carex occidentalis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in diverse wetland conditions."
