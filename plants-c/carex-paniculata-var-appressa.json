    "intro": "Carex paniculata var. appressa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy areas in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers in the summer months. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swampy or pond margins. Its compact growth habit and ability to stabilize soil make it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
