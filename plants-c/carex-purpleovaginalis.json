    "intro": "Carex purpleovaginalis, commonly known as the purple-veined sedge, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, such as in marshes or along stream edges. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it produces distinctive purple-veined leaves that give it its common name. Carex purpleovaginalis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability."
