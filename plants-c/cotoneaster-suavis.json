    "intro": "Cotoneaster suavis, commonly known as sweet cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. The plant is characterized by its simple, oval-shaped leaves and compact growth habit. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Cotoneaster suavis is also valued for its role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds that feed on its berries."
