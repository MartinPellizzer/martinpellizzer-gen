    "intro": "Calanthe devogelii, commonly known as the Devogel's calanthe, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
