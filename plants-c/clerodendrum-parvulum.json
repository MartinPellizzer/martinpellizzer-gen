    "intro": "Clerodendrum parvulum, commonly known as the small-leaved cleerodendrum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by spherical, fleshy fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
