    "intro": "Campanula mathonetii, commonly known as the Mathon's bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Campanula mathonetii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in garden settings with proper drainage."
