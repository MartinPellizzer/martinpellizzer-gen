    "intro": "Crescentia microcarpa, commonly known as the little-fruit trumpet tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces large, fragrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its fruit is a small, round, green capsule that splits open to reveal several seeds. Crescentia microcarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm climates for its unique appearance and ecological benefits."
