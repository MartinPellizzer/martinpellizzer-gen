    "intro": "Chytranthus fouilloyanus, commonly known as the Fouilloy's chytranthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern France. It belongs to the Capparaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and distinctive, lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
