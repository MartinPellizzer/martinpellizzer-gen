    "intro": "Cereus beysiegelii, commonly known as the Beysiegel's cactus, is a species of cacti native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and sparse, spiny areoles. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cereus beysiegelii is often cultivated for its striking appearance and unique blooming habit."
