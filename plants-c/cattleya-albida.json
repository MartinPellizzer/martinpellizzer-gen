    "intro": "Cattleya albida, commonly known as the white cattleya, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers with a subtle pinkish hue at the base, which bloom during the dry season. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, often arranged in a fan shape. Cattleya albida is valued for its ornamental beauty and is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
