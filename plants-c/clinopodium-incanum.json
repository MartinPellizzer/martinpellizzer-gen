    "intro": "Clinopodium incanum, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Clinopodium incanum is often found in disturbed soils, gravelly slopes, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
