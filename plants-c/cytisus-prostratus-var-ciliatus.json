    "intro": "Cytisus prostratus var. ciliatus, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with finely toothed edges, and it thrives in well-drained, sunny soils. It is often used in landscaping for erosion control due to its hardy and spreading nature."
