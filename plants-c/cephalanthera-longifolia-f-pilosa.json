    "intro": "Cephalanthera longifolia f. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy long-leaved twayblade, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and meadows, where it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is considered a species of concern in many areas."
