It is a hardy perennial that thrives in cold climates and is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It has hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to flourish in extreme conditions."
