    "intro": "Corion marinum var. leiospermum, commonly known as the smooth-seeded sea corion, is a coastal plant adapted to saline and sandy environments. It features small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in smooth, leathery pods that disperse with the wind. This variety is often found in dune ecosystems along the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts."
