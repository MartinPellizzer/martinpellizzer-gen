It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically dark green with a distinctive black or dark brown margin. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, three-lobed flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds.
