    "intro": "Coffea andrambovatensis, commonly known as the Andrambovatensis coffee, is a rare and lesser-known species of the Coffea genus. It is native to Madagascar, where it grows in the wild in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds used for coffee production. Its botanical characteristics include dark green, elliptical leaves and small, white flowers. Due to its limited distribution and low cultivation, it remains a subject of botanical interest and conservation efforts."
