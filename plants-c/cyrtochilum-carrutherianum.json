It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, hairy growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct lip, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
