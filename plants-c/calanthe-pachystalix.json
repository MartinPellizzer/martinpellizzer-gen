    "intro": "Calanthe pachystalix, commonly known as the rock calanthe, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and possesses a pseudobulb that supports its survival in rocky or shaded environments. The plant typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, pale green to white flowers with distinct sepals and petals. It thrives in cool, humid conditions and is often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species in the wild."
