    "intro": "Cordia meridensis, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Cordia meridensis is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping."
