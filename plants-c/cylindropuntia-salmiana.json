    "intro": "Cylindropuntia salmiana, commonly known as the Salmiana cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are segmented and covered in clusters of small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with minimal water requirements. The Salmiana cholla plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
