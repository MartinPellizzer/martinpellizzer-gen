It is a herbaceous annual that produces distinctive, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pale purple to white in color. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. The flowers bloom in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name."
