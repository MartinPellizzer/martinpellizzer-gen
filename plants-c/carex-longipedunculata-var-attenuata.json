    "intro": "Carex longipedunculata var. attenuata, commonly known as the slender-bracted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and cylindrical inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, making it a common sight in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in dense clusters, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. The varietal form, attenuata, is distinguished by its gradually tapering inflorescences compared to the typical form."
