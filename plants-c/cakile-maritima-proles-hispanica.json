    "intro": "Cakile maritima proles hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish sea rocket, is a halophytic plant adapted to coastal environments. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines, where it withstands salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by pods containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a succulent texture that helps retain moisture in arid conditions. This species plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal ecosystems."
