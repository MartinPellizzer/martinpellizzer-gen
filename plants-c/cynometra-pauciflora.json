    "intro": "Cynometra pauciflora, commonly known as the little-flowered ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant has elliptical leaves that are opposite and often have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces yellowish flowers that are clustered in small inflorescences, and its fruits are woody capsules containing several seeds. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is often considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
