    "intro": "Callistroma erubescens, commonly known as the red-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that thrives on the branches of host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, pink to red flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that contain seeds coated in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to host plants. It is native to parts of South America and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its parasitic nature, it can impact the health of its host trees if left unchecked."
