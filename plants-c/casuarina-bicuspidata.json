It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical, fern-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces woody cones that contain edible seeds, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. Casuarina bicuspidata thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often forming dense thickets in dune environments. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing soil erosion."
