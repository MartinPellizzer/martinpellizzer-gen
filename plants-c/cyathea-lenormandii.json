It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in its natural habitat. Its rhizome system supports the growth of its massive fronds, which can span several meters in width. Cyathea lenormandii is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests."
