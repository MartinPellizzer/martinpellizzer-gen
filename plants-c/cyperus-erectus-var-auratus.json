    "intro": "Cyperus erectus var. auratus, commonly known as the golden flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as along water edges or in swampy areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily and form dense vegetation. The species is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive appearance and adaptability."
