    "intro": "Chromatotriccum deflexum, commonly known as the creeping broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a slender, branched stem and small, scale-like leaves that are often hidden beneath the soil. It is typically found in disturbed soils and can be a common weed in agricultural fields. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants."
