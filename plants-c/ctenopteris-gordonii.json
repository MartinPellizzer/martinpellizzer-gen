It is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply lobed leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near coastal areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can grow extensively, making it a hardy and resilient species. The flowers, though small, are typically yellow or orange and contribute to its ornamental value."
