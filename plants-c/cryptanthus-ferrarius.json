    "intro": "Cryptanthus ferrarius, commonly known as the red-flowered carpet plant, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Haemodoraceae, which includes plants known for their striking, often brightly colored flowers. The plant is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of fleshy, grass-like leaves that form a compact mat. Its flowers are typically bright red or orange, emerging from the center of the rosette in late spring or early summer. Cryptanthus ferrarius is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant color and compact growth habit."
