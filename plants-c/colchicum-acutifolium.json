    "intro": "Colchicum acutifolium, commonly known as the sharp-leaf colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, often hairy leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces striking purple to pinkish flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a loose cluster at the top of a leafless stem. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
