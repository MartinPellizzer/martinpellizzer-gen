    "intro": "Cryptanthus felixii, commonly known as the pink carpet plant, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial native to Brazil. It features dense clusters of small, fleshy leaves that form a compact rosette, often with a pinkish or reddish hue. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the spring and summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its compact size and ornamental foliage. Cryptanthus felixii thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish."
