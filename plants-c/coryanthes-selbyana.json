    "intro": "Coryanthes selbyana, commonly known as the Selby's coryanthe, is a striking tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, intricate flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, featuring a unique structure with a central column and a lip that often displays vibrant colors. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Its flowers are pollinated by specific species of flies and beetles, which are attracted by the plant's strong, often unpleasant odor. Coryanthes selbyana is also notable for its ability to grow epiphytically on trees, making it an important component of the rainforest ecosystem."
