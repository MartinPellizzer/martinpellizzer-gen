    "intro": "Calophyllum pseudotacamahaca, commonly known as the Caribbean mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, glossy leaves. The tree produces yellowish flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, though it is now considered endangered due to overexploitation. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
