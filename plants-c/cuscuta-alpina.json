    "intro": "Cuscuta alpina, commonly known as the alpine dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It has slender, yellow or orange stems that wrap around its host, forming a network of connections. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and relies on wind for pollination. It is often found in alpine and arctic regions, where it thrives in harsh, nutrient-poor environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and survival of its host plants."
