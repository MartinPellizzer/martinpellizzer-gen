    "intro": "Centella capensis var. micrantha, commonly known as the Cape pennywort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional African medicine. Its ability to form dense mats makes it useful for erosion control and habitat creation for small organisms."
