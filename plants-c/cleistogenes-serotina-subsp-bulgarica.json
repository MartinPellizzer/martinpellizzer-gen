    "intro": "Cleistogenes serotina subsp. bulgarica, commonly known as the Balkan false wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces compact, spike-like inflorescences that are typically closed at maturity, a feature typical of cleistogamous flowering. It thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in steppe and grassland habitats. This subspecies is notable for its ecological resilience and is considered an important component of its native ecosystems."
