    "intro": "Chamaecrista brevicalyx var. brevicalyx, commonly known as the dwarf velvet bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling those of other members of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a food source. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment in agricultural settings."
