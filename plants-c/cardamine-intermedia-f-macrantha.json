    "intro": "Cardamine intermedia f. macrantha, commonly known as the giant watercress, is a variant of the watercress species native to moist, temperate regions. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender stalks above the water surface. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. This fern-like plant thrives in nutrient-rich, shallow waters and is often found in stream margins and wetlands."
