    "intro": "Corydalis pterygopetala var. megalantha, commonly known as the giant winged corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and clusters of delicate, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while the flowers have a distinctive, wing-like structure on the petals. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This variant is notable for its larger flower size compared to other members of the Corydalis species."
