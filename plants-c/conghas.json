    "intro": "Conghas, commonly known as the African violet, is a tropical plant native to Eastern Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and velvety foliage. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, often with a contrasting central spot. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Conghas are popular as houseplants due to their ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
