    "intro": "Cynanchum fruticulosum, commonly known as the creeping milkweed, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family, which includes other milkweeds, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including mammals and birds. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its fibrous roots make it a hardy plant that can spread vegetatively through rhizomes."
