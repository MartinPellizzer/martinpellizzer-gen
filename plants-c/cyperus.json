    "intro": "Cyperus, commonly known as sedges, is a genus of flowering plants in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. These plants are typically found in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Cyperus species are characterized by their triangular stems, narrow leaves, and small, clustered flowers. They play an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms. Some species are also cultivated for ornamental purposes due to their attractive foliage and ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
