    "intro": "Ceraia fugax, commonly known as the common blue butterfly, is a species of sea slug found in marine environments. It belongs to the family Chromodorididae and is characterized by its vibrant blue coloration and intricate patterns on its dorsal surface. The plant-like appearance of Ceraia fugax is due to its leaf-like body structure, which helps it blend with its surroundings. It is often found in shallow coastal areas where it feeds on algae and other microscopic organisms. This species plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as prey for various marine predators."
