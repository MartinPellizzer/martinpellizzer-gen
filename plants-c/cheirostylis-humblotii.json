It features a slender, erect stem with several lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces intricate, spider-like flowers with long, slender petals and a distinctive, hooded labellum. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom successfully. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
