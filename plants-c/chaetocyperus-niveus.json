    "intro": "Chaetocyperus niveus, commonly known as the snowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments in Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, silver-gray blades that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in water gardens and restoration projects."
