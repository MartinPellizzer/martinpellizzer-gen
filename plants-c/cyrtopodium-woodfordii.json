    "intro": "Cyrtopodium woodfordii, commonly known as the Woodford's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, forming a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi to absorb nutrients. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
