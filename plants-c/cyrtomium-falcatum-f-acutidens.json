    "intro": "Cyrtomium falcatum f. acutidens, commonly known as the sharp-toothed holly fern, is a compact, evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features leathery, dark green, lance-shaped fronds with sharply pointed teeth along the edges. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense clumps. The fronds are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
