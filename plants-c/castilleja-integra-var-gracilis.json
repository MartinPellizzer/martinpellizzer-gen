    "intro": "Castilleja integra var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and features showy, reddish-orange bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant has a slender stem and is often found growing in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and meadows. Its roots penetrate the roots of host plants to obtain nutrients, while it produces its own leaves and flowers. It blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators with its vibrant display."
