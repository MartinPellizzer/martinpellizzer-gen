    "intro": "Cereus brevispinus, commonly known as the short-spined cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, pale green stems and sparse, short spines. The plant produces large, white, night-blooming flowers that attract pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
