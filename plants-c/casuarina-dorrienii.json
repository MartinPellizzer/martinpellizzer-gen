    "intro": "Casuarina dorrienii, commonly known as the slender she-oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals around the stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds. Casuarina dorrienii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
