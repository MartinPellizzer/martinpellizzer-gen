    "intro": "Caesalpinia decapetala var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to regions of Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange floral clusters that appear at the ends of its branches. The leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like leaflets, giving the plant a delicate, lace-like appearance. The bark is often fissured and may exude a reddish sap, while the plant produces long, flat pods that contain seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates."
