    "intro": "Cattleya macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered cattleya, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, featuring vibrant colors such as pink, red, and orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, tropical environments. The flowers bloom once a year, often in the spring or summer, making it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
