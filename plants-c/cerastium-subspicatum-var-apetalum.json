    "intro": "Cerastium subspicatum var. apetalum, commonly known as the pink snowberry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous small, fleshy, hairy leaves that are typically covered in a white waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are actinomorphic and lack petals, which is reflected in its varietal name \"apetalum.\" This species is often found in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun."
