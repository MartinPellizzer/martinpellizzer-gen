    "intro": "Cleistocactus pojoensis, commonly known as the Pojo cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in white to pale green spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, a unique trait among cacti. It is adapted to extreme arid conditions, storing water in its thick stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
