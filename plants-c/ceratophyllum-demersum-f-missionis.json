    "intro": "Ceratophyllum demersum f. missionis, commonly known as the Mexican hornwort, is a submerged aquatic plant native to Central America. It features dense, branching stems covered with small, spiny leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often submerged, making them less visible. It thrives in freshwater environments with moderate to high light levels and is often found in ponds and lakes. This variety is valued in aquariums for its ornamental qualities and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
