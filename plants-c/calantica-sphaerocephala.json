It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, rounded yellow flowers. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a dense, upright cluster. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable addition to botanical collections."
