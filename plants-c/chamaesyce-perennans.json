    "intro": "Chamaesyce perennans, commonly known as the creeping purslane, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across the ground. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Chamaesyce perennans is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a common weed in many regions."
