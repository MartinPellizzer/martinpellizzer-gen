    "intro": "Cornus grandis, commonly known as the Chinese cornel or red osier dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its ornamental red stems that become prominent in the winter. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Cornus grandis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its seasonal color. It is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing food for birds and other wildlife."
