    "intro": "Comocladia intermedia, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a halophytic shrub that thrives in coastal and estuarine environments. It is characterized by its distinctive red bark and the presence of pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures that aid in gas exchange in waterlogged soil. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, and its fruits are small, leathery drupes that contain a single seed. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms. Comocladia intermedia is widely distributed across tropical and subtropical regions of the Indo-Pacific."
