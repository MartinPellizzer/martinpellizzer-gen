    "intro": "Cerastium breviflorum, commonly known as the short-flowered chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its frost-tolerant nature. Cerastium breviflorum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and rocky slopes."
