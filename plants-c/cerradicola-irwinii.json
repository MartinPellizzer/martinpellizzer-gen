    "intro": "Cerradicola irwinii, commonly known as the Irwin's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its striking, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its small, delicate leaves are typically clustered at the base, and it produces a single, showy flower per stem. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Cerradicola irwinii is considered critically endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws."
