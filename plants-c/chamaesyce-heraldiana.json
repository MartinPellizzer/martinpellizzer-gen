It belongs to the family Portulacaceae, which includes many species of flowering plants adapted to arid environments. The plant features fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a suitable plant for xeriscaping and rocky garden settings."
