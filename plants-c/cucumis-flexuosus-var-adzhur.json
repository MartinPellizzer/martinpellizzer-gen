It is native to regions of Africa and is characterized by its elongated, spiky fruit that resembles a horn. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a sprawling growth habit. Its fruit is typically harvested when immature, as it becomes too bitter when fully mature. The botanical features of this plant make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and culinary use."
