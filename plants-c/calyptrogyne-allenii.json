    "intro": "Calyptrogyne allenii, commonly known as the Allen's mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It thrives in brackish and saline environments, often found in estuaries and tidal marshes. The plant has small, simple leaves that are typically covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a distinctive fruit that aids in seed dispersal. Calyptrogyne allenii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
