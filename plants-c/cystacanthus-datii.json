    "intro": "Cystacanthus datii, commonly known as the parasitic liver fluke, is a trematode belonging to the family Fasciolidae. It is a small, flat, leaf-shaped parasite that primarily infects the liver of its host, typically domestic and wild ruminants. The adult flukes have a complex life cycle involving intermediate hosts such as snails and aquatic plants. The plant-like appearance of the fluke's body is a characteristic feature of the family. Cystacanthus datii is known for its ability to cause significant pathological damage to the liver tissue of infected hosts."
