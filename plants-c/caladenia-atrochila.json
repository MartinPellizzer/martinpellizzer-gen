    "intro": "Caladenia atrochila, commonly known as the black-lipped spider-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils within heathlands and open forests. The plant features a single, slender stem with a single flower that has a dark purple to black lip and a greenish-yellow dorsal sepal. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by thynnid wasps, which are attracted to its specialized structure. The species is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and land clearing."
