    "intro": "Clethra canescens var. ledermannii, commonly known as the Ledermann's sweet pepperbush, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features slender, branching stems covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, while the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in native gardens."
