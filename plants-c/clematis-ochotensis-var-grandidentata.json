    "intro": "Clematis ochotensis var. grandidentata, commonly known as the large-toothed clematis, is a deciduous vine native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves with large, serrated leaflets that give it its common name. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of white, pink, or purple. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Its vigorous growth habit requires support structures, such as trellises or fences, for optimal display."
