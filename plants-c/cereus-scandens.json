    "intro": "Cereus scandens, commonly known as the climbing cactus or the night blooming cereus, is a succulent plant native to South America. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that can grow quite long, often climbing or trailing along supports. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, making it well adapted to arid environments. Cereus scandens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique flowering display."
