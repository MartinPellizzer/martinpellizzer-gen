    "intro": "Carex oligocarpa f. subuniflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedges, is a sedge species belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This subspecies is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
