    "intro": "Cryptocoryne wendtii var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf cryptocoryne, is a compact aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features narrow, dark green leaves that are typically shorter and broader than those of the standard Cryptocoryne wendtii. This variety thrives in low to moderate light conditions and prefers soft, slightly acidic water with a temperature range of 18-28\u00b0C. Its slow growth rate makes it suitable for small aquariums or planted tanks with limited space. The plant is known for its resilience and ability to tolerate a variety of water parameters, making it a popular choice among aquarists."
