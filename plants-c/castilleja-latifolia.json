    "intro": "Castilleja latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients through its root system. The plant is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it often grows in open habitats such as grasslands and meadows. Castilleja latifolia plays a role in supporting pollinators and contributes to the ecological diversity of its native environments."
