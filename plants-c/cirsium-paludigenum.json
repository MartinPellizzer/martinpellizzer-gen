    "intro": "Cirsium paludigenum, commonly known as the marsh thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features a robust root system and tall, sparsely hairy stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough texture and spiny margins, while its flowers are purple to pink, arranged in a single, showy head. Cirsium paludigenum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
