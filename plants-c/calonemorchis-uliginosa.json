    "intro": "Calonemorchis uliginosa, commonly known as the bog orchid, is a rare and specialized flowering plant that thrives in wetland and peatland habitats. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires consistent moisture, often found in bogs or marshes. It plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland environment. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
