It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. Carex marcida plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
