    "intro": "Cymopterus sessiliflorus, commonly known as the sessile-flowered evening primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has simple, opposite, and often hairy leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack stalks. Its flowering stems are usually unbranched and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
