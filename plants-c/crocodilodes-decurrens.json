    "intro": "Crocodilodes decurrens, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats that help stabilize the soil. Its narrow, linear leaves are usually less than 10 cm long, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. Crocodilodes decurrens plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
