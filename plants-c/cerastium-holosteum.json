    "intro": "Cerastium holosteum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, rounded seed pods. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical structure makes it well adapted to survive in cool, temperate climates."
