    "intro": "Cissus koehneana, commonly known as the climbing fig-leaf gooseberry, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are typically green when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical forests. Its rapid growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental use in warm climates."
