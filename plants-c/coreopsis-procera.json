    "intro": "Coreopsis procera, commonly known as the tall coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 feet, featuring slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces bright yellow, daisy-like flowers with a central disk and ray florets, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, ornamental plants. Coreopsis procera is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
