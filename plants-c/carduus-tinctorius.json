    "intro": "Carduus tinctorius, commonly known as the woad plant, is a biennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rough, spiny leaves and large, blue or purple flowers that bloom in the second year of growth. The plant is notable for its historical use in producing indigo dye, which was widely used in textile manufacturing. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are sturdy and often branched. Carduus tinctorius thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides or in waste areas."
