    "intro": "Cynanchum holstii, commonly known as Holst's milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist woodlands and along stream banks, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant features opposite, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its most distinctive characteristic is the milky sap it exudes when the stems or leaves are broken. This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
