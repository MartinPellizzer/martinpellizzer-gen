    "intro": "Cyclea laxiflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered cyclea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Solanaceae, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, often blooming during the rainy season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Cyclea laxiflora is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
