    "intro": "Costus rosulifer, commonly known as the rose-leaf costus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that resemble the shape of a rose. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Costus rosulifer is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
