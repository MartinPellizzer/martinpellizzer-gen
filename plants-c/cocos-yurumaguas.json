    "intro": "Cocos yurumaguas, commonly known as the Yurumaguas coconut, is a unique palm species native to the Peruvian Amazon. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves. The plant produces coconuts that are typically smaller than those of the common coconut, with a thick husk and a sweet, aromatic flesh. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in swampy or wetland areas. The Yurumaguas coconut is valued for its edible fruit and has cultural significance among local communities."
