It is characterized by its striking white and green striped petals and a unique, elongated lip. This plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous regions. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a delicate beauty to its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
