It is native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia, and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves and small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale yellow. It produces small, dark blue to black berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in conservation reserves."
