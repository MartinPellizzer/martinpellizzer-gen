    "intro": "Crocus meridionalis, commonly known as the southern crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It produces showy, saucer-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous underground stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Crocus meridionalis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible flowers."
