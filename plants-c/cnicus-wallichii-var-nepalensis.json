    "intro": "Cnicus wallichii var. nepalensis, commonly known as the Himalayan sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in rocky and alpine environments. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas."
