It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental foliage and clustered flowers. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries. It is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for the extraction of quinine, though it is less commonly used than other cinchona species. The tree typically grows in humid, shaded environments at higher altitudes."
