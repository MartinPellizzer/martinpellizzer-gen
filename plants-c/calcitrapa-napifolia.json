    "intro": "Calcitrapa napifolia, commonly known as the woolly bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, a common reproductive strategy among members of the Brassicaceae family. Calcitrapa napifolia is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, semi-desert conditions."
