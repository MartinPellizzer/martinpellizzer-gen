    "intro": "Cladrastis shikokiana, commonly known as the Japanese candleberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are often followed by long, slender seed pods. Its ornamental value is due to its showy blooms and distinctive foliage, making it a popular choice in gardens. However, it is relatively rare in cultivation and requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth."
