    "intro": "Carex coriacea, commonly known as the rough sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like leaves that are rough to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that typically bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wetlands. Carex coriacea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
