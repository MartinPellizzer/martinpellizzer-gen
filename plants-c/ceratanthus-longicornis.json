    "intro": "Ceratanthus longicornis, commonly known as the longhorned sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal and inland desert regions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in arid environments. Ceratanthus longicornis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh, dry conditions."
