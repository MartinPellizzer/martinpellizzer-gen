    "intro": "Caladenia longii, commonly known as the slender spider-orchid, is an orchid species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, elongated flower with a distinctive spider-like appearance. The plant typically grows in sandy or loamy soils in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. It blooms during late spring to early summer, producing a pale green to yellowish flower with a deep, narrow lip. Caladenia longii is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, reflecting its complex ecological relationships."
