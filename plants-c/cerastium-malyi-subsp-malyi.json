    "intro": "Cerastium malyi subsp. malyi, commonly known as the Maly's mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, hairy, oval-shaped leaves and produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its habitat."
