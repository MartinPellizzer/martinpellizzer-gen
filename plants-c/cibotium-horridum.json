    "intro": "Cibotium horridum, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a thick layer of fibrous, brownish-gray bark. The plant produces a crown of large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. Its reproductive structures include sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures located on the underside of the fronds. Cibotium horridum is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and is valued for its ornamental and traditional uses."
