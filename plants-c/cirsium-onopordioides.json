    "intro": "Cirsium onopordioides, commonly known as the yellow star-thistle, is a flowering plant native to western North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in summer, and the plant produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. However, it is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
