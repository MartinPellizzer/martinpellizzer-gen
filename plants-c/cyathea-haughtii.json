    "intro": "Cyathea haughtii, commonly known as the Haught's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a distinctive root system that forms a dense, fibrous mat, which helps anchor it in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically dark green and can grow to impressive lengths, contributing to its ornamental value. Cyathea haughtii thrives in humid climates and is often found in forest understories where it receives indirect sunlight."
