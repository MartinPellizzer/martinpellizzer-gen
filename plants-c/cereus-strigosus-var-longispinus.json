    "intro": "Cereus strigosus var. longispinus, commonly known as the long-spined cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces spiny, segmented stems with areoles that bear both spines and flowers. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, opening at night and attracting nocturnal pollinators. This cactus is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
