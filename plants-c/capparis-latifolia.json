    "intro": "Capparis latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf caper, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often thorny, and its fragrant, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, greenish fruits that turn red when mature, containing seeds within a fleshy pulp. Its leaves are broad and oval, with a slightly rough texture, and the plant is drought-tolerant once established. Capparis latifolia is often found in rocky or coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
