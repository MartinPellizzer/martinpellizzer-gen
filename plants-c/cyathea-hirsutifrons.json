    "intro": "Cyathea hirsutifrons, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in lowland forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Cyathea hirsutifrons plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various organisms."
