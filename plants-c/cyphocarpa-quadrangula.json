The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, and it is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Cyphocarpa quadrangula is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is well-suited to harsh environmental conditions. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
