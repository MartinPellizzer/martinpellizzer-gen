    "intro": "Croton agrarius var. inversus, commonly known as the red-rooted croton, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its striking, opposite leaves that are typically green with reddish veins, and its small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in some areas."
