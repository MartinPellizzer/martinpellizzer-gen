It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy texture. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. Clidemia pilosa is also known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions."
