    "intro": "Castilleja linearis, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and relies on the roots of neighboring plants for some of its nutrients. The plant produces bright orange to yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and branching. Castilleja linearis plays a role in ecological interactions by influencing the growth of its host plants and providing nectar for pollinators."
