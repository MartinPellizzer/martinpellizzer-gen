    "intro": "Capurodendron microphyllum, commonly known as the dwarf umbrella tree, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered leaves that resemble tiny umbrellas. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often followed by small, round berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though its botanical properties remain under study."
