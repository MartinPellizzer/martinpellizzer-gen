    "intro": "Cecropia antillarum, commonly known as the Antillean cecropia, is a fast-growing tree native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive, hollow stems. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with certain ant species, which reside in the hollow stems and protect the tree from herbivores. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in disturbed habitats such as forests and along riverbanks. Its rapid growth makes it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive in non-native areas."
