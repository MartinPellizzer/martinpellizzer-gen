It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces vibrant blue to purple flowering heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically features narrow, linear leaves and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, its invasive potential in certain regions has led to its classification as a weed in some areas."
