    "intro": "Capparis ovata var. kurdica, commonly known as the Kurdish flower or mountain caper, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces yellow, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a sharp, tangy flavor. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, often growing at high altitudes. Its botanical features make it an important plant in both ecological and traditional medicinal contexts."
