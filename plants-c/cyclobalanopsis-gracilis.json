    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis gracilis, commonly known as the slender talaud, is a species of evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its hard, durable wood. The plant produces small, cup-shaped fruit known as a cupule, which encloses one or two seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland and montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
