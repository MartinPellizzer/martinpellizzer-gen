    "intro": "Cheiranthus rupestris, commonly known as the rock wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and is often found growing on rocky soils and cliffs. The plant produces small, brightly colored flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cheiranthus rupestris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
