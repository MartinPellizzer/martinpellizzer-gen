    "intro": "Ceraia saaronica, commonly known as the Saronic ceraia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, a typical feature of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some parts of its range."
