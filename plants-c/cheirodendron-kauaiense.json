    "intro": "Cheirodendron kauaiense, commonly known as Kauai's ghost tree, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It is a small tree or shrub characterized by its smooth, gray bark and broad, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by distinctive, winged fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mesic to wet forest habitats. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is a focus of conservation efforts."
