    "intro": "Crataegus oxyacantha subvar. eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, oval leaves that are covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The flowers are typically pink or white, appearing in clusters, and the fruit is a red, fleshy berry that ripens in the fall. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its winter interest and wildlife value. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
