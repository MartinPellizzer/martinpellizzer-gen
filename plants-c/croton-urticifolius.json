    "intro": "Croton urticifolius, commonly known as the stinging croton, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa, the Caribbean, and parts of South America. It is characterized by its opposite, often hairy leaves that can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive, spiny capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
