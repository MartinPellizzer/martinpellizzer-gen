    "intro": "Campanula scheuchzeri subsp. schleicheri, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
