It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are pink to lavender in color and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cremanthodium larium is known for its delicate, grass-like foliage and is often found in open meadows and talus slopes."
