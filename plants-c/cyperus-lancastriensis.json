    "intro": "Cyperus lancastriensis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments. Cyperus lancastriensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in moist conditions."
