    "intro": "Coryanthes, commonly known as lobster claws, are tropical plants belonging to the family Orchidaceae. They are characterized by their unique, often brightly colored flowers that resemble clawed hands, hence their common name. These plants are native to regions such as Madagascar, Southeast Asia, and parts of Africa. Their flowers are typically large and showy, with intricate structures that aid in pollination by specific insects. Coryanthes require warm, humid environments and are often grown as ornamental plants due to their striking appearance."
