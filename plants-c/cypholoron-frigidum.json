    "intro": "Cypholoron frigidum, commonly known as the cold-loving orchid, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to thrive in extremely cold environments. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often greenish or bluish flowers. This plant typically grows in alpine or arctic regions where temperatures remain low year-round. Its survival depends on specific soil conditions and minimal competition from other flora. Due to its limited habitat, Cypholoron frigidum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
