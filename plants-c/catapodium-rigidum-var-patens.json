    "intro": "Catapodium rigidum var. patens, commonly known as the rigid catapodium, is a perennial grass species native to certain regions of Australia. It is characterized by its upright, rigid stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
