    "intro": "Crudia hirtelloides, commonly known as the roughleaf cudweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in grasslands and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture, and it produces small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in spring. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
