    "intro": "Calamagrostis vinealis, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage that turns coppery in the fall, making it a popular ornamental plant. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its culms are slender and often arching, creating a graceful, feathery appearance. Silvergrass is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
