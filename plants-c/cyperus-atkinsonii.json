It belongs to the sedge family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Cyperus atkinsonii produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, which are often borne on short stalks. It is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils and its decorative foliage."
