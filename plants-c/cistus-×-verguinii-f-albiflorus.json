    "intro": "Cistus \u00d7 verguinii f. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered rock rose, is a hybrid shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, with small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or coastal environments. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
