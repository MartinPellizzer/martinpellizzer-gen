    "intro": "Cardamine hirsuta var. litoralis, commonly known as the coastal buttercup, is a variant of the hairy bittercress that thrives in moist, often saline environments. It is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. This plant is often found along coastal areas, riverbanks, and wet meadows where it can tolerate fluctuating water levels. Its adaptability to brackish conditions makes it a notable species in coastal botany. The plant's morphology reflects its evolutionary adaptation to coastal ecosystems, with features that help it withstand salt spray and tidal influences."
