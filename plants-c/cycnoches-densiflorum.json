    "intro": "Cycnoches densiflorum, commonly known as the denseflower waterleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its flowers bloom in late spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
