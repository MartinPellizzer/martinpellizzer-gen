    "intro": "Cenchrus americanus subsp. chudeaui, commonly known as the coastal sand grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. This subspecies thrives in sandy, coastal environments and is adapted to withstand salt spray and frequent wind exposure. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are typically pale green to brown in color. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal habitats."
