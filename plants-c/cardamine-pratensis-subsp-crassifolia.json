    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis subsp. crassifolia, commonly known as broad-leaved watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along streambanks, wet meadows, and marshy areas. The plant features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its small, white or greenish flowers are borne in clusters and are pollinated by insects. The species is valued for its peppery flavor and has been used in traditional cuisine and herbal medicine."
