    "intro": "Cupressus acuta, commonly known as the Japanese cypress, is a species of evergreen coniferous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. Cupressus acuta prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it adaptable to a variety of climates. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a popular choice for hedging and as a specimen plant."
