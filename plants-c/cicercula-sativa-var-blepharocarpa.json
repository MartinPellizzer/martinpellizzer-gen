    "intro": "Cicercula sativa var. blepharocarpa, commonly known as the eye-leaf plant, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which features leaves with prominent, eye-like markings. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a delicate, pale yellow color. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
