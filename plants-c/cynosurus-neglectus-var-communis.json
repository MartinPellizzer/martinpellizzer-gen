    "intro": "Cynosurus neglectus var. communis, commonly known as common rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, heaths, and rocky soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in disturbed or marginal environments. This variety is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
