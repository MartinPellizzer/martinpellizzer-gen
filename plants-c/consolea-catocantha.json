    "intro": "Consolea catocantha, commonly known as the Ghost Cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems that can reach up to 10 meters in height, making it one of the tallest cacti in the world. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
