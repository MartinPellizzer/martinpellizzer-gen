    "intro": "Cerastium pedunculatum, commonly known as the clustered chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has slender, erect stems covered with fine hairs and produces tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Cerastium pedunculatum is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to spread easily through stolons."
