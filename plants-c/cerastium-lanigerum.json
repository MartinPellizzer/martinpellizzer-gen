    "intro": "Cerastium lanigerum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, hairy leaves and clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss, adapting it to damp conditions. Cerastium lanigerum is often found in temperate regions and is part of the Caryophyllaceae family."
