    "intro": "Cyperus congestus subsp. heldreichianus, commonly known as the Balkan flatsedge, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, fens, and along the margins of lakes and rivers. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in its native environment. The species is characterized by its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
