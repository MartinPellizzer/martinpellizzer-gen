    "intro": "Chlorophytum viscosum, commonly known as the Tiger's Tail or Spider Plant, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It is characterized by its long, arching leaves that are often covered in a fine, sticky resin, giving it a unique texture. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its ability to thrive in a variety of light conditions makes it a popular houseplant. The sticky sap, known as latex, is a notable botanical feature that can be used as a natural adhesive."
