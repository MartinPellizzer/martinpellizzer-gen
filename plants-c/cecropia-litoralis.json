    "intro": "Cecropia litoralis, commonly known as the coastal cecropia, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a fast-growing, evergreen shrub or small tree that thrives in coastal and mangrove habitats. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves with prominent veins and a waxy surface. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in panicles, while its fruit is a three-lobed, fleshy capsule that splits open to release seeds. Cecropia litoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
