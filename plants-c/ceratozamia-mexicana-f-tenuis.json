    "intro": "Ceratozamia mexicana f. tenuis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a rare cycad species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, dark green leaves that are arranged in a dense, fan-like pattern. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in humid, well-drained soil and requires indirect sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
