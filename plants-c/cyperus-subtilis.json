    "intro": "Cyperus subtilis, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often forming dense stands in shallow water. Its flowers are small and clustered, with three stamens and a single pistil, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Cyperus subtilis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
