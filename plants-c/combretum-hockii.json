It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often glandular-dotted. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in terminal clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various arid and semi-arid environments. Combretum hockii is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appearance."
