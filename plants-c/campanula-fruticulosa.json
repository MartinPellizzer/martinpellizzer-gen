    "intro": "Campanula fruticulosa, commonly known as the shrub bellflower, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white. The plant has hairy, often grayish leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Campanula fruticulosa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
