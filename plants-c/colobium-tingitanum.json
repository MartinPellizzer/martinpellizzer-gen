    "intro": "Colobium tingitanum, commonly known as the Canary Island orchid, is a rare and endangered plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant has a short, erect stem with few leaves, and its flowers are clustered in a spike at the top. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is adapted to the unique Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is highly vulnerable to extinction."
