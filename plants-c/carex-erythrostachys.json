    "intro": "Carex erythrostachys, commonly known as the red-stalked sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, consist of small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Carex erythrostachys is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
