    "intro": "Carica cauliflora, commonly known as the papaya plant, is a tropical fruit-bearing tree native to Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive green, fuzzy fruit that matures to a yellow-orange color. The plant produces flowers and fruit directly on the stem, a phenomenon known as cauliflorous growth. Its fruit is rich in vitamin C and contains the enzyme papain, which is used in food processing and medicine. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
