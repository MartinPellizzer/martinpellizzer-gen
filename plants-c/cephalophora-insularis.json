    "intro": "Cephalophora insularis, commonly known as the island cephalophora, is a rare flowering plant native to specific island ecosystems. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its foliage is lance-shaped with a rough texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cephalophora insularis is considered endangered in many regions."
