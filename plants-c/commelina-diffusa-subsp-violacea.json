    "intro": "Commelina diffusa subsp. violacea, commonly known as violet dayflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture and produces striking violet-blue flowers with three petals and a distinctive three-lobed spathe. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along streambanks. It is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a common weed in disturbed areas. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
