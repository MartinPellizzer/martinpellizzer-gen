    "intro": "Coleus igolotorum, commonly known as the velvet leaf coleus, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its velvety, deep green foliage with intricate patterns of silver and purple veins. The plant belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is valued for its vibrant, textured leaves that add visual interest to gardens and containers. It thrives in warm, humid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. While it is primarily grown for its aesthetic appeal, it is not typically used for culinary or medicinal purposes."
