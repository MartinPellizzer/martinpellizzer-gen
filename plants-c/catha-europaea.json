    "intro": "Catha europaea, commonly known as khat, is a flowering plant native to the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing minute, black seeds. Its leaves contain psychoactive compounds, primarily cathinone and cathine, which contribute to its traditional use as a stimulant. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas with well-drained soil."
