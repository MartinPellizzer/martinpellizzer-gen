It features slender, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters, with small, scale-like leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces spikes of tiny, three-lobed flowers, which are usually pale yellow or greenish, giving it a delicate appearance. It thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshes, wetlands, and along waterways. Its botanical structure makes it adaptable to various aquatic and semi-aquatic environments."
