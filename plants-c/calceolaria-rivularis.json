    "intro": "Calceolaria rivularis, commonly known as the river calceolaria, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions with moist, temperate climates. It is characterized by its distinctive, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically violet or blue in color. The plant prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or woodland settings. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Calceolaria rivularis is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
