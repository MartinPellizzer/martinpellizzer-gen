    "intro": "Cephalaria squamiflora subsp. ebusitana, commonly known as the Ebusi cephalaria, is a perennial herb native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
