    "intro": "Cerefolium sylvestre f. furcatum, commonly known as the forked wood sorrel, is a rare fern-like plant characterized by its distinctive, bifurcated leaves. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly the Carpathian Mountains. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a soft, hairy texture and produces small, yellow flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
