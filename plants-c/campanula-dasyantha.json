    "intro": "Campanula dasyantha, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, woolly stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Campanula dasyantha is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its visual interest."
