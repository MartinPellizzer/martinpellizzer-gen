    "intro": "Cathartolinum neomexicanum, commonly known as the New Mexico cathartolinum, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of New Mexico. It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The plant has adapted to its harsh environment with a deep root system and thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss. It blooms during the summer months and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected under various conservation programs."
