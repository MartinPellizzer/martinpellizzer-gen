    "intro": "Calamus heatubunii, commonly known as the Hainan calamus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae. It is native to southern China, particularly the Hainan Island, where it thrives in humid, tropical environments. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender rhizomes and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spadices, a feature common in many palms. Calamus heatubunii is valued for its aromatic rhizomes, which have been used in herbal remedies for their purported health benefits."
