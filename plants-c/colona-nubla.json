    "intro": "Colona nubla, commonly known as the cloud mist plant, is a unique species native to high-altitude regions with moist, temperate climates. It features a tall, slender stem covered in fine, silvery hairs that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often blooming in late spring. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to capture moisture from the air. Due to its specialized habitat, Colona nubla is considered a rare and delicate species, often found in cloud forests."
