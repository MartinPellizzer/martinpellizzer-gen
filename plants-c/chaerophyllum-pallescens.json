    "intro": "Chaerophyllum pallescens, commonly known as the pale hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic compounds. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, calcareous soils in woodland edges and meadows. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in flat-topped clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits. The species is noted for its ability to thrive in shaded environments while still maintaining its characteristic botanical features."
