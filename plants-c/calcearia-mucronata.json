    "intro": "Calcearia mucronata, commonly known as the horned Venus, is a striking member of the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its unique, horn-like tubers that are covered in a dense layer of white, velvety hair. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive spurred shape that resembles a miniature orchid. Calcearia mucronata thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden settings."
