    "intro": "Conopharyngia cumminsii, commonly known as the Cummins' conopharyngia, is a rare and little-studied plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures are unique, featuring a specialized inflorescence that aids in wind pollination. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
