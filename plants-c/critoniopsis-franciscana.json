    "intro": "Critoniopsis franciscana, commonly known as the Franciscan criton, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep red. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or along riverbanks. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth texture and a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Critoniopsis franciscana is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
