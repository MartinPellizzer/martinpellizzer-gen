    "intro": "Cerasus chamaecerasus var. floribunda, commonly known as the double-flowered cherry or Japanese double-flowered cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and profuse display of double flowers, which consist of multiple layers of petals. The plant produces small, edible fruits known as cherries, though they are typically not cultivated for consumption. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring blooming and foliage color changes throughout the seasons."
