    "intro": "Crepidomanes lunulatum, commonly known as the moon-leaf or moon-plant, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
