    "intro": "Cousinia macilenta, commonly known as the slender cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late summer. It has silvery-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Cousinia macilenta is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in semi-desert habitats."
