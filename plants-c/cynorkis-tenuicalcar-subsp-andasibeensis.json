    "intro": "Cynorkis tenuicalcar subsp. andasibeensis, commonly known as the Andasibe slender-stemmed orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the rainforests of Madagascar. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of dense tropical forests. Its leaves are narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to retain moisture in the moist, nutrient-poor soils of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native region."
