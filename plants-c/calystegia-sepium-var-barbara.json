    "intro": "Calystegia sepium var. barbara, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a perennial vine native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple. The plant has a climbing habit and can spread aggressively, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence the common name. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, facilitating its spread in various habitats."
