    "intro": "Cytisus repens, commonly known as creeping candle bush, is a low-growing shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and trifoliate, with a hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and rocky areas."
