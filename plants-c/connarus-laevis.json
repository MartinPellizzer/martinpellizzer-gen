It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes a wide range of shrubs and trees. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often smooth and glossy. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by insects. The fruit is a small capsule that releases seeds when mature, contributing to its dispersal in the wild."
