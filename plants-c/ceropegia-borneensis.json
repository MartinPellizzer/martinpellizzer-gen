    "intro": "Ceropegia borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed species known for their milky sap. The plant is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing along forest floors or on rocky outcrops. Due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
