It is a low-growing perennial shrub with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions due to its deep root system. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
