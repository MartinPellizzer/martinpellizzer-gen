    "intro": "Cleistes huberi, commonly known as the fairy lantern, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Oenotheraceae family and is characterized by its small, showy, lantern-shaped flowers that open in the evening. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its flowers emit a faint scent to attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. Due to habitat loss, Cleistes huberi is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation programs."
