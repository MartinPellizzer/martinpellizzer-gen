    "intro": "Cleome breyeri, commonly known as the \"spider flower,\" is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its unique, spindly stems and clusters of small, pink to white flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cleome breyeri is often found in disturbed soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is a popular choice for ornamental gardening due to its distinctive appearance and low maintenance requirements."
