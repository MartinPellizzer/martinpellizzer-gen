    "intro": "Cleyera lipingensis var. taipinensis, commonly known as the Taipin cleyera, is a rare evergreen shrub native to southern China. It belongs to the family Pentaphylacaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by orange-red berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in subtropical forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
