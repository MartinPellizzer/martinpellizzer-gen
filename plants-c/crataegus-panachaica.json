    "intro": "Crataegus panachaica, commonly known as the Greek hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often sour, and they contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Crataegus panachaica thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or scrubland habitats. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential cardiovascular benefits."
