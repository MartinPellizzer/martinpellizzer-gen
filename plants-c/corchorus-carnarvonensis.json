    "intro": "Corchorus carnarvonensis, commonly known as the Carnarvon pricklybur, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh, dry environments it inhabits. Corchorus carnarvonensis is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to survive in low-water conditions."
