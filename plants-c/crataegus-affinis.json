    "intro": "Crataegus affinis, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Crataegus affinis is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it has a long history of use in traditional medicine. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in botanical gardens and natural habitats."
