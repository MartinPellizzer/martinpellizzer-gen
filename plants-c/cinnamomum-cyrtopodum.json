    "intro": "Cinnamomum cyrtopodum, commonly known as the nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Banda Islands in Indonesia. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and dark, oily bark, which contain essential oils. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by egg-shaped fruits that contain a single seed. Its most valuable part is the seed, which is used to make nutmeg and mace, both prized for their flavor and aroma. The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional medicine for centuries."
