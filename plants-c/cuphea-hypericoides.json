    "intro": "Cuphea hypericoides, commonly known as the wax plant or honeycomb plant, is a flowering plant native to Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its unique, tubular, red or pink bracts that resemble wax candles, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and containers. Cuphea hypericoides is also valued for its ability to attract hummingbirds and other pollinators with its nectar-rich flowers."
