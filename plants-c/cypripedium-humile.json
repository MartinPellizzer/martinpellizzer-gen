    "intro": "Cypripedium humile, commonly known as the dwarf lady's slipper, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features a single, showy pink or white flower with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is adapted to trap pollinators. The plant typically grows in cool, moist habitats such as forests and meadows, often in shaded environments. Its leaves are usually oval and arranged in a rosette, and it produces a slender, erect stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
