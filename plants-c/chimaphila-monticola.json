    "intro": "Chimaphila monticola, commonly known as the mountain flameless plant, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, low-growing form. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, providing a dense cover that helps retain moisture in its rocky, acidic soil habitat. Chimaphila monticola is often found in shaded, moist woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
