    "intro": "Cyathula lanceolata var. scabrida, commonly known as the rough cyathula, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It features simple, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a notable species for ecological studies and wetland conservation efforts."
