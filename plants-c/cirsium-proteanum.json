    "intro": "Cirsium proteanum, commonly known as the variable thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its common name reflects the variability in its appearance, as it can exhibit different leaf shapes and flower structures depending on environmental conditions. Cirsium proteanum is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads."
