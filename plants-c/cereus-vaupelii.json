    "intro": "Cereus vaupelii, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cactus species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and its ability to produce large, fragrant white flowers at night. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water. Its flowers typically open only during the night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Cereus vaupelii is prized in horticulture for its striking appearance and unique blooming habit."
