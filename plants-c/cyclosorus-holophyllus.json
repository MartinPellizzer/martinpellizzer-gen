    "intro": "Cyclosorus holophyllus, commonly known as the golden thread fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow to golden-green fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is short and thick, supporting the growth of its aerial fronds. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
