    "intro": "Camissonia sierrae subsp. sierrae, commonly known as Sierra camissonia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Sierra Nevada foothills of California. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white to pale blue flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native range. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected under California's Endangered Species Act."
