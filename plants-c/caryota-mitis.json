    "intro": "Caryota mitis, commonly known as the fishtail palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped leaves that resemble a fish's tail, hence its common name. The plant grows as a single-stemmed palm with a smooth, grayish trunk and can reach heights of up to 15 meters. Its leaves are large, pinnately compound, and often have a waxy texture. Caryota mitis is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in warm climates due to its striking foliage."
