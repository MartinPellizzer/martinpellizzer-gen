    "intro": "Carex perlonga, commonly known as the longleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, consist of small, scale-like bracts that produce wind-pollinated flowers. Carex perlonga plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
