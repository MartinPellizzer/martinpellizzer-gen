    "intro": "Claytonia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf spring beauty, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the western United States. It features delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are hairy and oval-shaped, adapted to retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in rocky or gravelly areas. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant collections."
