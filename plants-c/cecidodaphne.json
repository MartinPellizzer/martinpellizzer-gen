    "intro": "Cecidodaphne, commonly known as the flame tree, is a member of the Lythraceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its striking, fiery orange to red flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late summer or early autumn. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly serrated edge. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal."
