    "intro": "Clematis glycinoides, commonly known as the Japanese clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to East Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are typically white or pale blue, appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental climbers. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often regulated or restricted in cultivation."
