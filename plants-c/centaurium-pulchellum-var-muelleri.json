The plant is herbaceous, with slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
