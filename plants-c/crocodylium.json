    "intro": "Crocodylium, commonly known as the crocodile plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Its roots are fibrous and capable of absorbing nutrients from the soil efficiently. Crocodylium is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
