    "intro": "Coffea tenuiflora, commonly known as the dwarf coffee plant, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1-2 meters. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries containing two seeds. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and have a slightly serrated edge. While not widely cultivated for commercial coffee production, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its unique characteristics and limited distribution."
