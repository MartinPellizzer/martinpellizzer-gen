    "intro": "Cowania mexicana subsp. stansburiana, commonly known as the desert cowania, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, pink to red flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh desert conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss and deep roots for moisture absorption. It typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in crevices or along dry streambeds. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
