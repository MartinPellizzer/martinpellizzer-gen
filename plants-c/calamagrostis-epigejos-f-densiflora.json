    "intro": "Calamagrostis epigejos f. densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered silvergrass, is a compact, clump-forming grass species native to eastern Asia. It features narrow, silver-gray leaves that are often lined with fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that are typically pale green to golden in color. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and marshy areas. This ornamental grass is valued for its attractive foliage and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
