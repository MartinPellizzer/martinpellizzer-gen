    "intro": "Carex greeniana, commonly known as green sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like flower clusters. Native to moist, shaded environments, it thrives in wetlands, stream banks, and forest floors. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a valuable plant for erosion control and wetland restoration."
