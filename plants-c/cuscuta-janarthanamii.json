    "intro": "Cuscuta janarthanamii, commonly known as the Janarthanam dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, attaching itself with specialized haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers and is native to parts of South and Southeast Asia. It is often found growing on various herbaceous plants and shrubs. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and survival of its host."
