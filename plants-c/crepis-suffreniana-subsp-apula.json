    "intro": "Crepis suffreniana subsp. apula, commonly known as the Apulian hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly the Apulia region of Italy. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy, elongated leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. It is a perennial species that produces small, oval seeds enclosed in a pappus, aiding in wind dispersal. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species."
