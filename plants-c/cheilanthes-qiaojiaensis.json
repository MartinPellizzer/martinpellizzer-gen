The plant typically grows on rocky substrates in high-altitude regions, showcasing adaptations to arid and cool climates. Its fronds are usually short and thick, with a leathery texture that helps conserve moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
