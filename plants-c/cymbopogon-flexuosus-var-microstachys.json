The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and produces small, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its essential oils used in aromatherapy and culinary applications. Its botanical features make it valuable in both traditional medicine and modern fragrance industries."
