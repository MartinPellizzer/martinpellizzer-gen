    "intro": "Carex praecox subsp. velenovskyi, commonly known as the early sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of streams. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. The plant is often found in temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia."
