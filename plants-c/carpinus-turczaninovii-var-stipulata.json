    "intro": "Carpinus turczaninovii var. stipulata, commonly known as the stipulate hornbeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often pubescent and have stipules at the base. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its fruit is a small, winged samara that aids in seed dispersal. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and hardy nature."
