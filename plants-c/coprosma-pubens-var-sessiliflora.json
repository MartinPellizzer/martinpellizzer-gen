It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for native birds. It thrives in coastal and forested areas, preferring well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
