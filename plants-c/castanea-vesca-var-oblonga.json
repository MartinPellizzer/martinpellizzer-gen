    "intro": "Castanea vesca var. oblonga, commonly known as the Chinese horse chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to China and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that appear in the spring. The tree produces spiny, oval-shaped fruits that enclose a single chestnut-like seed. Its botanical features include smooth, gray bark and a tendency to grow in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
