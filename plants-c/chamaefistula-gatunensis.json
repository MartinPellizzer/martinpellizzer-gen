It is native to Central America and is characterized by its distinctive trumpet-shaped yellow flowers. The plant has a shrub-like growth habit with woody stems and small, elliptical leaves. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils. The flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich nature."
