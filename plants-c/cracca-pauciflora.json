    "intro": "Cracca pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered cracca, is a flowering plant species native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers and finely divided, fern-like leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Cracca pauciflora is considered a rare and specialized species."
