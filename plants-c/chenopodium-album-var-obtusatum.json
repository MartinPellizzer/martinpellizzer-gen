    "intro": "Chenopodium album var. obtusatum, commonly known as lamb's-quarters, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its alternate, broadly ovate leaves with a waxy coating and a distinctive, mild, spinach-like flavor. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, followed by dry, triangular seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields, gardens, and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a common weed in many regions."
