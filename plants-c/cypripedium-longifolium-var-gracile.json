    "intro": "Cypripedium longifolium var. gracile, commonly known as the slender-lipped lady's slipper, is a rare and elegant orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white petals and a distinctive, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often in rocky or humus-rich soil. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is known for its intricate floral structure and pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
