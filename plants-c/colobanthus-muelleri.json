    "intro": "Colobanthus muelleri, commonly known as Antarctic hair grass, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean islands. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is adapted to extreme cold and has a shallow root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important role in the ecological balance of its harsh environment by providing food and habitat for local invertebrates. Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered a key indicator species of the Antarctic flora."
