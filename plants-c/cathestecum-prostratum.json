It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or white in color. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
