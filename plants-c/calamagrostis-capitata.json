    "intro": "Calamagrostis capitata, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows, bogs, and marshes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and the flowers are usually a striking purple or pinkish hue. Calamagrostis capitata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
