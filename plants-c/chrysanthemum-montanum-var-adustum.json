It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showing a high degree of adaptability to harsh conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and vibrant floral display."
