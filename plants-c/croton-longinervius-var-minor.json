    "intro": "Croton longinervius var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf croton, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Asia. It features glossy, elliptical leaves with a distinctive yellow or orange midrib, giving it a striking visual appeal. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
