    "intro": "Cyrtandra latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, including Hawaii, Southeast Asia, and the Philippines. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial or small shrub, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its leaves are usually broad and elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Cyrtandra latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting various pollinators."
