    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. barcelonensis, commonly known as the Barcelona hazel, is a variety of the common hazel native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped nuts that are typically covered in a dense, hairy husk. The plant produces both male and female flowers on the same individual, with the males appearing as catkins and the females as small, clustered buds. Its leaves are elliptical, serrated, and turn yellow in the autumn. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
