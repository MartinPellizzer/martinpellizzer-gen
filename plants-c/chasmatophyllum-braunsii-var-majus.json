    "intro": "Chasmatophyllum braunsii var. majus, commonly known as the giant spider orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to Australia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble spiders, with long, slender petals and a distinctive, elongated labellum. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in arid or semi-arid regions, often in shaded or partially shaded environments. Its flowering period occurs during the cooler months, usually from late autumn to early spring. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in some areas."
