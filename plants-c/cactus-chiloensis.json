    "intro": "Cactus chiloensis, commonly known as the Chilean apple cactus, is a species native to the coastal regions of Chile and Peru. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, green stems that often bear spines and are covered in a white, waxy coating. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by edible, apple-like fruits. It thrives in arid and coastal environments, adapting to salt spray and sandy soils. Cactus chiloensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional cuisine."
