    "intro": "Clusia petiolata, commonly known as the waxleaf clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are usually dark green and glossy, providing a striking visual appeal. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red or orange berries. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its ability to thrive in shaded environments and its low maintenance requirements. Clusia petiolata is also valued for its air-purifying properties and its use in traditional medicine."
