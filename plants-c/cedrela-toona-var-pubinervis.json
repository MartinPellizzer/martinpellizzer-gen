    "intro": "Cedrela toona var. pubinervis, commonly known as the hairy-veined toona, is a tropical tree species characterized by its compound leaves with prominent, hairy veins. It belongs to the Meliaceae family, which includes mahogany and other economically important timber trees. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and has a straight, cylindrical trunk with smooth, gray bark. Its flowers are small and clustered, often greenish-white in color, and it produces round, woody fruits containing several seeds. The species is valued for its durable wood, though it is also threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting."
