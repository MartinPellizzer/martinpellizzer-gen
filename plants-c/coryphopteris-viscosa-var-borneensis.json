    "intro": "Coryphopteris viscosa var. borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean sticky holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Borneo. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, serrated fronds that are often covered in a fine, sticky substance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in humid and nutrient-rich environments. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky substrates or decaying organic matter. The varietal form, borneensis, is distinguished by its specific morphological traits adapted to the unique ecological conditions of Borneo."
