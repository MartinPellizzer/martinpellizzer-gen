    "intro": "Cinnagrostis alba var. breviaristata, commonly known as the short-bracted white cottongrass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features fluffy, white seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced after the plant has flowered. The leaves are typically short and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue that helps it blend into its alpine or arctic habitats. This variety is distinguished by its shorter bracts compared to the typical form of Cinnagrostis alba. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or wet meadow environments."
