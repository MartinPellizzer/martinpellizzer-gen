    "intro": "Cattleya violacea f. alba, commonly known as the white cattleya, is a hybrid orchid species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its large, fragrant, white flowers that often have a slight pink or lavender hue at the base. The plant produces pendulous blooms on tall, upright stems, and it thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light. It is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements. The white variant is particularly prized for its elegant, pure coloration."
