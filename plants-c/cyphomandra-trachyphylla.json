    "intro": "Cyphomandra trachyphylla, commonly known as the bitter apple or wild tomato, is a member of the Solanaceae family. It is a shrub that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, violet to purple flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are often bitter and not suitable for consumption. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
