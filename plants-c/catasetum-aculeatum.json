    "intro": "Catasetum aculeatum, commonly known as the spiked catasetum, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers that feature a unique structure with a specialized lip. The plant produces a column with a pollinia, which is a key feature in its pollination mechanism. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. The leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette, aiding in water retention in its natural habitat."
