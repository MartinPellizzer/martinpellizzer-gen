    "intro": "Coppensia hydrophila, commonly known as the water lily of New Zealand, is a striking aquatic plant native to the freshwater lakes of New Zealand. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in summer, often with a subtle pinkish hue. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, supported by long, flexible stems. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate at the bottom of the lake. Coppensia hydrophila plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various aquatic organisms."
