    "intro": "Coccoloba nigrescens, commonly known as the black nightshade or black mangrove, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows near coastal areas, often in brackish or saltwater environments. The plant has smooth, dark green leaves that turn reddish or purplish in the fall, and its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by bright red berries. It plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Due to its salt tolerance, it is also used in ecological restoration projects."
