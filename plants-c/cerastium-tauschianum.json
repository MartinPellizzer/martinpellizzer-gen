    "intro": "Cerastium tauschianum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, hairy leaves that are typically rounded or heart-shaped, and it produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early summer. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions. Cerastium tauschianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in garden settings with well-drained soil."
