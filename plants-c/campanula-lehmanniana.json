It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Campanula lehmanniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its striking floral display."
