    "intro": "Cotoneaster distichus var. duthieanus, commonly known as the Duthie's cotoneaster, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are arranged in a distinctive two-ranked pattern along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a foundation plant in landscapes. Its botanical characteristics make it a unique addition to both cultivated and natural habitats."
