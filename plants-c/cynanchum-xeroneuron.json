    "intro": "Cynanchum xeroneuron, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Cynanchum xeroneuron plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to thrive in harsh, low-nutrient soils."
