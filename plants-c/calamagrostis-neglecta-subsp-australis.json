    "intro": "Calamagrostis neglecta subsp. australis, commonly known as the Australian bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for drought-tolerant landscaping. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive foliage and ability to form dense, low-growing clumps."
