    "intro": "Centaurea lyraefolia, commonly known as the lyreleaf centaurea, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb with a compact, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces showy, purple-blue flower heads that are surrounded by spines, typical of the Centaurea genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from spring to early summer."
