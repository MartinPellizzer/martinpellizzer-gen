It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in two rows. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often pale green to brown in color. It thrives in wet or marshy environments, making it a common species in wetlands and along the edges of water bodies. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
