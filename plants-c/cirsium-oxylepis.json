    "intro": "Cirsium oxylepis, commonly known as the desert thistle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cirsium oxylepis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
