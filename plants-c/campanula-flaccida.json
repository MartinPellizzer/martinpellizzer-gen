    "intro": "Campanula flaccida, commonly known as the drooping bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy, linear leaves and a compact growth habit, often forming dense mats. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Campanula flaccida is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
