    "intro": "Castelnavia princeps, commonly known as the royal castelnavia, is a rare and exotic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers and deeply lobed, waxy leaves that reflect sunlight. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike. Due to its limited habitat, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
