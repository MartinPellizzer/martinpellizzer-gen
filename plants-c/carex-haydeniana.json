    "intro": "Carex haydeniana, commonly known as Hayden's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex haydeniana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
