It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Cyperus mauryi is often found in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, where it thrives in shallow water or saturated soil. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
