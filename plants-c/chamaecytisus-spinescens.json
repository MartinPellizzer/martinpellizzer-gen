    "intro": "Chamaecytisus spinescens, commonly known as the creeping rosemary, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features woody stems covered in fine, silvery hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a strong, aromatic scent reminiscent of rosemary. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
