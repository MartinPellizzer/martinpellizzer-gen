It produces smaller, elongated fruits with a distinct, often ribbed appearance compared to the typical papaya. The plant is notable for its rapid growth and high productivity, making it a valuable cultivar in tropical agriculture. Botanically, it retains the basic structure of Carica papaya but exhibits variations in leaf shape and fruit development. This form is particularly favored for its flavor and nutritional content, contributing to its popularity in local markets."
