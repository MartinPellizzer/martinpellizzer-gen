    "intro": "Citriobatus multiflorus, commonly known as the fragrant citrus orchid, is a tropical plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a citrus-like scent. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its native habitat, which includes parts of Southeast Asia. Its leaves are broad and leathery, providing a lush green backdrop to its showy blooms. Citriobatus multiflorus thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
