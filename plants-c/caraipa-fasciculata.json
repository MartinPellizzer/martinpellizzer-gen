    "intro": "Caraipa fasciculata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and is highly valued for its acoustic properties. The plant has compound leaves with elongated leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species."
