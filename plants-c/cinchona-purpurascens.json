    "intro": "Cinchona purpurascens, commonly known as the purple bark cinchona, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental value due to its vibrant, often purplish foliage. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are elliptical with a smooth surface and are often tinged with red or purple hues, especially under sunlight. While not widely cultivated for its bark like other cinchona species, it is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal."
