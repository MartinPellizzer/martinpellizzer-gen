    "intro": "Corethrogyne racemosa, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with a low, spreading growth habit, often forming mats of succulent leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are fleshy and covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Corethrogyne racemosa is adapted to survive in drought conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
