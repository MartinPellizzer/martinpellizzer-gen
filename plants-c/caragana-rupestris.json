    "intro": "Caragana rupestris, commonly known as the rock caragana, is a shrub native to central Asia, particularly found in arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its small, compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in poor soil and extreme temperatures. Its wood is hard and durable, making it useful for fuel and construction. Caragana rupestris plays an important role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats."
