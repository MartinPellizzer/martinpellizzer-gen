    "intro": "Cypripedium chantinii, commonly known as the Chantin's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is known for its delicate, pale pink to white petals. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cypripedium chantinii is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
