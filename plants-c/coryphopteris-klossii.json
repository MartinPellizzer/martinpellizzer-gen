    "intro": "Coryphopteris klossii, commonly known as the Kloss's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat."
