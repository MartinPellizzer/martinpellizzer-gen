    "intro": "Costus lamingtonii, commonly known as the Lamington costus, is a tropical plant native to the highland rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is a member of the Zingiberaceae family, which includes gingers, and is characterized by its tall, slender rhizomes and narrow, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of red, yellow, and orange, which bloom in clusters at the top of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden environments. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
