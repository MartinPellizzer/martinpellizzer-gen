    "intro": "Cranichis stictophylla, commonly known as the green-tipped orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high elevations of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a distinctive reddish or brownish tip, and they bloom in late summer or early autumn. This orchid thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
