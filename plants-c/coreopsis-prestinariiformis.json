The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and riverbanks. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is valued for its ornamental appeal in native gardens. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
