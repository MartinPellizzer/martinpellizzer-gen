    "intro": "Cassebeeria pumila, commonly known as the dwarf cassia, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom throughout the warm seasons. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often used in landscape design for borders or as a container plant."
