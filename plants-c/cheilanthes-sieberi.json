    "intro": "Cheilanthes sieberi, commonly known as the rock fern or Sieber's rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. The plant has lance-shaped, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Cheilanthes sieberi is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in harsh environments."
