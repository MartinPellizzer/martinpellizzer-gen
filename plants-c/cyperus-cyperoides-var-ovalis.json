    "intro": "Cyperus cyperoides var. ovalis, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters, typically in wet or marshy environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are usually wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly rough texture, and it often forms dense vegetation in wetlands. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
