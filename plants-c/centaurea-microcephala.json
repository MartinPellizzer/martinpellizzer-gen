    "intro": "Centaurea microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf centaurea, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, bright yellow flowers surrounded by blue or purple bracts. The plant typically reaches a height of no more than 10 centimeters, making it well adapted to rocky and arid environments. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is known for its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions, which contributes to its widespread distribution across its native range."
