It features aromatic, slightly fuzzy leaves that are ovate to broadly ovate in shape, with rounded or obtuse tips. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers arranged in dense terminal clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and borders. Its medicinal properties have been historically used in herbal remedies for digestive and respiratory ailments."
