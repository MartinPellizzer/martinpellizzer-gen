    "intro": "Calamagrostis alpicola, commonly known as alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and fine, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and cold climates. It produces fluffy, panicle-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate ornamental quality to its appearance. Due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with rocky or dry conditions."
