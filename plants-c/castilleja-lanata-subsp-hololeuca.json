    "intro": "Castilleja lanata subsp. hololeuca, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish to reddish flowers, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Due to its parasitic nature, it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants."
