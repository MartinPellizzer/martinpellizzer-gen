    "intro": "Cereus colicochus, commonly known as the night bloomer or moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking white flowers that open at night, emitting a subtle fragrance. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. Cereus colicochus is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
