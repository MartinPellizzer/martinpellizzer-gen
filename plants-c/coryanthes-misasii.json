    "intro": "Coryanthes misasii, commonly known as the Misasii coryanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its large, intricate flowers that resemble a crown, with a distinctive central spadix and showy sepals. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in montane rainforests. Its floral structure is adapted for specific pollinators, such as certain flies and beetles. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
