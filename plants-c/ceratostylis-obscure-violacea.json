    "intro": "Ceratostylis obscure-violacea, commonly known as the purple-stained orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a slender, leafless stem that bears a single, showy, violet-pink flower with a distinctive, club-shaped spur. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its flowers are typically short-lived but attract specific pollinators such as bees and wasps. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
