    "intro": "Chamaeangis ichneumonea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lungwort, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a distinctive network of veins. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in spikes, usually appearing in shades of pink or white. The species is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its preference for cool, humid climates."
