    "intro": "Cuscuta candicans, commonly known as the golden dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on agricultural crops and wild plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, contributing to its widespread distribution. Cuscuta candicans is considered a weed in many regions due to its ability to reduce crop yields."
