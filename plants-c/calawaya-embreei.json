It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as mesic forests. The plant has simple, opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and are usually white or pale yellow in color. Calawaya embreei plays an important ecological role in its native environment, though it is threatened by habitat loss and invasive species."
