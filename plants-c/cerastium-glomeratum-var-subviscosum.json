    "intro": "Cerastium glomeratum var. subviscosum, commonly known as sticky mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, hairy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments like woodland floors and stream banks. Its sticky leaves and compact growth habit make it a distinctive and ecologically valuable species in its native habitat."
