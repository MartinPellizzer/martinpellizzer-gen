    "intro": "Calamagrostis stricta subsp. atrorubens, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and its distinctive purple or reddish hues in the inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its culms are slender and often arching, while the leaves are narrow and grass-like. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in wetland environments."
