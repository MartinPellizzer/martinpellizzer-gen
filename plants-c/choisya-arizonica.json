    "intro": "Choisya arizonica, commonly known as Arizona holly, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its seasonal color changes and compact growth habit."
