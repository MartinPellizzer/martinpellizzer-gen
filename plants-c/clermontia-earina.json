    "intro": "Clermontia earina, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 silversword, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves. The plant produces a single, tall stem that bears a cluster of small, tubular, white flowers. It thrives in the high-elevation volcanic soils of Haleakal\u0101 National Park. Due to its limited habitat and historical decline, it is considered an endangered species."
