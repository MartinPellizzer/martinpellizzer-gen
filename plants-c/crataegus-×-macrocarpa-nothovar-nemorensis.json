It is characterized by its dark, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces white flowers in spring, followed by red to black berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature. This cultivar is notable for its dense growth habit and ability to tolerate a variety of soil conditions."
