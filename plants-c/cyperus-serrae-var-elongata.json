    "intro": "Cyperus serrae var. elongata, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. It is characterized by its elongated leaves and ability to thrive in saturated soils. This variant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological adaptability."
