    "intro": "Citrullus vulgaris var. maximus, commonly known as watermelon, is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family and is characterized by its large, lobed leaves and vigorous vine growth. The plant produces large, fleshy fruits with a thick rind and juicy, sweet flesh that varies in color from red to yellow or green. Its flowers are typically yellow with five petals and are separate from the fruiting structures. The fruit develops from a single ovary after successful pollination, and the seeds are enclosed within the pulp. Watermelon is native to Africa but is now cultivated worldwide for its hydrating and nutritious properties."
