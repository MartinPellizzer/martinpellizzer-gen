    "intro": "Cincinalis vellea, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are often surrounded by bracts. It thrives in moist, warm environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. The leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
