It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive hairy texture along the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its robust root system makes it a valuable plant for soil stabilization and erosion control."
