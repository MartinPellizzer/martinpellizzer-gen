    "intro": "Centranthus nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra needlegrass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in high-elevation environments, such as mountain ranges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and clustered in dense, yellowish or reddish inflorescences. Centranthus nevadensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in arid regions."
