    "intro": "Crocus nubigena, commonly known as the alpine crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps and surrounding mountain ranges. It produces striking, saucer-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often with a distinctive yellow or orange center. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge in early spring before the flowers. Crocus nubigena is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
