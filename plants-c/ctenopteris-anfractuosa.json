    "intro": "Ctenopteris anfractuosa, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stolons that allow it to spread across the forest floor. Its leaves are bi-pinnate, with a complex structure that enhances its ability to capture light in shaded environments. Ctenopteris anfractuosa is often found in moist, shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
