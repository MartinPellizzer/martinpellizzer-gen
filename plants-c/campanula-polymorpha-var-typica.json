It features delicate, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.
