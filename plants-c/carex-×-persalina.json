    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 persalina, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Carex brevicuspis and Carex lyngbyei, characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage. The plant typically forms compact clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. It thrives in moist to wet environments, making it a popular choice for wetland gardens and pond margins. Due to its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil, it is widely cultivated in aquatic and bog gardens."
