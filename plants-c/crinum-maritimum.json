    "intro": "Crinum maritimum, commonly known as the sea lily or coastal crinum, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has strap-shaped, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Its bulbs are large and fleshy, serving as storage organs for nutrients and water. Crinum maritimum thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to saline environments, making it a hardy coastal species."
