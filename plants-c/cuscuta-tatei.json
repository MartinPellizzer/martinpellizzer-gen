    "intro": "Cuscuta tatei, commonly known as the Japanese dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true leaves, stems, and roots. It attaches itself to host plants using haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found growing on a variety of hosts, including grasses and shrubs. Cuscuta tatei is native to East Asia and is considered an invasive species in some regions. Its rapid growth and ability to weaken host plants make it a significant ecological concern."
