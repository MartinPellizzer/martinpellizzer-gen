    "intro": "Centaurea carlovensis, commonly known as the Carlovenian coneflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright, branching stems covered in fine hairs. Its bright blue to purple flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
