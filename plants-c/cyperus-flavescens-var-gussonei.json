It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that often appear in summer. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as along the edges of ponds or in poorly drained soils. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. Due to its adaptability, it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
