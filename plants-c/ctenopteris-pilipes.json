    "intro": "Ctenopteris pilipes, commonly known as the hairy sea palm, is a species of marine plant belonging to the family Zosteraceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant thrives in shallow, intertidal zones where it is exposed to wave action and tidal fluctuations. Its structure allows it to withstand harsh coastal conditions while providing habitat for various marine organisms. Ctenopteris pilipes plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and supporting biodiversity."
