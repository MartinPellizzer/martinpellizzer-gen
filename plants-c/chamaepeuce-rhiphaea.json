It is a low-growing shrub with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features include hairy stems and a compact growth habit, which help it conserve water. It is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native range."
