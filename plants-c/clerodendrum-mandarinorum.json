It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange-red. The plant produces small, round, greenish-white fruits that are edible but not widely consumed. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, contributing to its visual appeal."
