    "intro": "Cissus simulans, commonly known as the rock fig or climbing cissus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Vitaceae. It is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant is characterized by its trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, fig-like fruits. Cissus simulans is often used in xeriscaping due to its ability to withstand drought conditions."
