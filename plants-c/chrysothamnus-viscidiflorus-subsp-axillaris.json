    "intro": "Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus subsp. axillaris, commonly known as the stickyflower goldenbush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and small, yellowish to golden flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically covered in a sticky, resinous substance, which gives the plant its common name. This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open slopes. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
