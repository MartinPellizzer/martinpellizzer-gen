    "intro": "Ceropegia schumanniana, commonly known as the string of hearts plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale green, blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ceropegia schumanniana is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its compact growth habit and attractive foliage."
