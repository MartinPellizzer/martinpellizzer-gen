    "intro": "Cyathoglottis, commonly known as the starry bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. These plants are characterized by their bell-shaped or tubular flowers, often with a star-like appearance due to their intricate petal arrangement. The leaves are typically lanceolate or ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Cyathoglottis species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, often found in woodland or meadow habitats. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and contribute to biodiversity in their native ecosystems."
