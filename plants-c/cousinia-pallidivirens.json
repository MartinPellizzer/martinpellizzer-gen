It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss. It produces small yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
