    "intro": "Chrysopogon villosulus, commonly known as the hairy stipa, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its tufted, hairy foliage and slender, often wiry stems. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands, roadsides, and wastelands. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, bract-based flowers. Chrysopogon villosulus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in harsh environments."
