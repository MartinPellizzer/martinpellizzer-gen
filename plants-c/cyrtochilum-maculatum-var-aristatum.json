    "intro": "Cyrtochilum maculatum var. aristatum, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It features a compact, rhizomatous growth habit with a single, often hairy leaf. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically arranged in a raceme. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
