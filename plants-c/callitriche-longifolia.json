    "intro": "Callitriche longifolia, commonly known as slender water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are elongated and narrow, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Callitriche longifolia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl."
