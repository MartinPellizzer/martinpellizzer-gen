    "intro": "Crotalaria membranacea, commonly known as the narrowleaf false flax, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its rapid growth makes it both a valuable forage plant and a potential weed."
