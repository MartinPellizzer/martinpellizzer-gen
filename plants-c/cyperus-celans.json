    "intro": "Cyperus celans, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedgeland, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered spikelets. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in wetland environments such as marshes and swampy areas. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-lobed, dry fruits. Cyperus celans is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
