    "intro": "Coffea ankaranensis, commonly known as the Ankaranensis coffee, is a rare and little-known species of coffee plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, red berries that contain the coffee beans. The plant is typically found in the understory of humid, tropical forests, thriving in shaded conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and faces significant conservation challenges. Its unique genetic makeup makes it a subject of interest for researchers studying coffee diversity and adaptation."
