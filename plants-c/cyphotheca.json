    "intro": "Cyphotheca, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Goodeniaceae. It is characterized by its striking, often blue or purple, bract-like structures that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline and sandy environments. Cyphotheca species are perennial herbs that often have succulent leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers. The genus includes several species, such as Cyphotheca maritima, which is native to southern Africa."
