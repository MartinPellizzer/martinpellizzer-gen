    "intro": "Coldenia dichotoma, commonly known as the African snowbush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a compact growth habit with branching that often occurs at the base, giving it a distinctive dichotomous structure. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a slightly hairy texture. Coldenia dichotoma is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
