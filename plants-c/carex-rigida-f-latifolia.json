    "intro": "Carex rigida f. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf sedges, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its stiff, grass-like leaves that are broader than those of typical sedges, often reaching widths of up to 1 centimeter. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in clusters, with the inflorescence often appearing as a dense, cylindrical structure. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland habitats."
