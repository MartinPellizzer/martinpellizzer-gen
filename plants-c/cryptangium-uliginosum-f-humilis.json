    "intro": "Cryptangium uliginosum f. humilis, commonly known as the bog cryptangium, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to wetland environments. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, herbaceous habit. The plant features small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. Its leaves are usually narrow and evergreen, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in peat bogs and other moist, shaded areas."
