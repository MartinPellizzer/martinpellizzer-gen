    "intro": "Camellia japonica var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf Japanese camellia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to southern Japan. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces showy, camellia-like flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained, acidic soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Due to its small size and ornamental value, it is often used in container gardening and as a specimen plant."
