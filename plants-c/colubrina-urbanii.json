    "intro": "Colubrina urbanii, commonly known as the Florida colubrina, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a slightly rough texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in its natural habitat."
