    "intro": "Cuscuta victoriana, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to various regions in the Americas and is often found growing on grasses, shrubs, and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, allowing it to spread to new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants, making it a significant weed in agricultural settings."
