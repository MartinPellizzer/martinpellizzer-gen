    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 richardsonii, commonly known as the Richardson's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its large, showy pink or purple flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a pollination trap. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments and has a long, fleshy rhizome that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single flower per stem, making it a striking addition to botanical gardens. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
