    "intro": "Cyperus albescens, commonly known as the white flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that often form dense clusters, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Cyperus albescens produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are usually clustered at the tips of the stems. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
