    "intro": "Cycas simplicipinna, commonly known as the simple-pinnate cycad, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The leaves are pinnately compound, with a smooth, waxy surface and a pale green color. This plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Cycas simplicipinna is a slow-growing, ancient plant that thrives in tropical and subtropical climates."
