    "intro": "Cotoneaster potaninii, commonly known as the Potanin's cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 meters, featuring dense, upright growth with elliptical to ovate leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Cotoneaster potaninii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness in temperate climates."
