    "intro": "Cyperus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf umbrella sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows to a height of only a few inches, with narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense clumps. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Cyperus pumilus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
