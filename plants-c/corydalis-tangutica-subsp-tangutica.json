    "intro": "Corydalis tangutica subsp. tangutica, commonly known as the Tangut Corydalis, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent regions. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
