It is a deciduous shrub that produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers, typically in shades of white, yellow, or red. The plant's leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Its fruit is a spherical, fleshy capsule that splits open to release seeds. Cestrum sphaerocarpum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like hummingbirds."
