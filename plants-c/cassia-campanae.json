    "intro": "Cassia campanae, commonly known as the golden bell tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, pendulous yellow flowers that resemble bells, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets and produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Cassia campanae is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
