    "intro": "Circaea alpina var. aleutica, commonly known as Aleutian whitebeard, is a flowering plant native to the northern regions of North America and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in moist, acidic soils, often found in tundra and alpine environments. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
