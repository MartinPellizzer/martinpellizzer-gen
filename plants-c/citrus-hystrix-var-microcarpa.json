    "intro": "Citrus hystrix var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf citron, is a compact, shrub-like citrus plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, fragrant, lemon-yellow fruits that are typically harvested when fully mature. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves and produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance and citrus scent. However, it is not commonly used for fruit production due to the small size and limited yield of its fruit."
