    "intro": "Cola etugei, commonly known as the Etugei cola, is a species of flowering plant in the family Sterculiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries like Gabon and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The plant is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. After flowering, it develops woody pods that contain several seeds. Cola etugei is not widely cultivated for commercial purposes but is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological role."
