    "intro": "Cleistes strangii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Cleistes strangii has small, scale-like leaves and produces a unique, fragrant flower that blooms in the evening. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
