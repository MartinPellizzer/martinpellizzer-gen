    "intro": "Chrysanthemoides, commonly known as the gum plant or chrysanthemum weed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is native to Australia and thrives in dry, disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural areas. It has a branched stem and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Chrysanthemoides is often considered invasive in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
