    "intro": "Cinnamomum mabberleyi, commonly known as the Mabberley's cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces dark brown, capsule-like fruits containing winged seeds, which aid in its dispersal. Its bark and leaves are used in traditional medicine and for their aromatic properties. Cinnamomum mabberleyi is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in subtropical gardens."
