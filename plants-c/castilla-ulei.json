It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Castilla ulei thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
