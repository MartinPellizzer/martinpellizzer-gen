It is characterized by its clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green and glossy on top and lighter green underneath. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The clustered fringeflower is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas and along streambanks."
