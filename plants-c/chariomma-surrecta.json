    "intro": "Chariomma surrecta, commonly known as the red-stemmed ironwood, is a member of the Fabaceae family and is native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure with thick, reddish-brown stems that provide structural support. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color, which bloom in late spring. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets that are arranged oppositely along the stems. Chariomma surrecta is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in harsh environments."
