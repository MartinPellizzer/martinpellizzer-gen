    "intro": "Cirsium \u00d7 vivantii, commonly known as the hybrid thistle, is a perennial plant characterized by its spiny, serrated leaves and purple to pink flower heads. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Cirsium vulgare and Cirsium palustre, resulting in a plant with a unique combination of traits from both parents. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and stream banks, and is native to Europe. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, and the flowers are often clustered in a spherical shape, making it visually distinctive. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens despite its potential invasiveness in certain regions."
