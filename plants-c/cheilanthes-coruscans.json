    "intro": "Cheilanthes coruscans, commonly known as the glittering rock fern, is a species of fern found in arid and rocky environments. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or crevice habitats. Its fronds are typically narrow and have a leathery texture, which helps reduce water loss. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern on the underside of the fronds."
