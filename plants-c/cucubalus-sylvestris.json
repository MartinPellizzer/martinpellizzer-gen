    "intro": "Cucubalus sylvestris, commonly known as the wild cucumber, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It produces large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, spiny fruits. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its fruits, though edible when young, become bitter and inedible as they mature. The species is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
