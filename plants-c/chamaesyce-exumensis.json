    "intro": "Chamaesyce exumensis, commonly known as the Exum's sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Portulacaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its small, yellow flowers are typically arranged in clusters and bloom during the dry season. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Chamaesyce exumensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
