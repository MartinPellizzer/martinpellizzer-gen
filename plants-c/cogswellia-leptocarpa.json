    "intro": "Cogswellia leptocarpa, commonly known as the slender-stemmed cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green and covered in small, white spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often clustered at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its stem for survival in dry conditions. Cogswellia leptocarpa is adapted to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy plant in desert environments."
