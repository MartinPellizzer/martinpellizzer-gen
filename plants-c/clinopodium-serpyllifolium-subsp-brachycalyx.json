    "intro": "Clinopodium serpyllifolium subsp. brachycalyx, commonly known as narrowleaf betony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, two-lipped blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter calyx compared to other members of the species."
