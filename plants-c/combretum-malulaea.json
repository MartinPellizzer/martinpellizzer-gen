It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish or grayish pubescence. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various arid and semi-arid environments. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release its seeds."
