    "intro": "Crepidium lowii, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and mountainous regions. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. It is characterized by its compact size and unique floral structure, which includes a spurred lip. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
