    "intro": "Cyperus articulatus var. multiflorus, commonly known as the spike rush, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that bears numerous small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and shallow water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense stands. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often emerging from the base of the plant."
