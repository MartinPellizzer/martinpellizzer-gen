    "intro": "Calceolaria celendinensis, commonly known as the Celend\u00edn slipper orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Calceolariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, slipper-shaped flowers that are often brightly colored. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as cloud forests and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh weather. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
