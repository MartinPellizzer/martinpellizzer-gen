    "intro": "Craspedia cynurica, commonly known as the coastal daisy or sea daisy, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers with white centers, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize sandy soils, making it valuable for coastal restoration projects. It is also cultivated as an ornamental plant for its hardy and drought-resistant nature."
