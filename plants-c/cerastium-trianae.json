    "intro": "Cerastium trianae, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its high-altitude environment. Cerastium trianae is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
