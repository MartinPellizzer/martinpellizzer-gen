    "intro": "Carex macrosandra, commonly known as the broad-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color, and it blooms during the summer months. Carex macrosandra prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments."
