    "intro": "Coffea becquetii, commonly known as the Congo coffee or Bantu coffee, is a species native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows to a height of about 2 to 3 meters. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries containing two seeds, which are used to make coffee. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less commercially cultivated coffee species."
