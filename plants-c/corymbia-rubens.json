    "intro": "Corymbia rubens, commonly known as the red blood gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a bluish-green hue and a rough texture. Corymbia rubens is adapted to dry, tropical climates and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
