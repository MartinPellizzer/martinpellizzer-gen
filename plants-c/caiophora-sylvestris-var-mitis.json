    "intro": "Caiophora sylvestris var. mitis, commonly known as the softleaf caiophora, is a lesser-known variant of the caiophora species. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves that are softer and more pliable compared to the standard variety. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate forest regions. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters during the spring. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity among horticulturists and botanists."
