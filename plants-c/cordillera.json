    "intro": "Cordillera, commonly known as the Andes, is a vast mountain range spanning several South American countries. It is characterized by its high elevation, rugged terrain, and diverse ecosystems. The region features a variety of plant life adapted to the harsh mountain climate, including alpine vegetation and hardy shrubs. Many endemic species thrive in the unique microclimates found along the Cordillera. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a biodiversity hotspot with rich flora."
