It is characterized by its spiky, purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and forms compact, upright clumps. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural areas."
