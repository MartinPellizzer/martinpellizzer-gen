    "intro": "Carex meiogyna, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, bogs, and along stream edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female inflorescences, a feature common in many sedges."
