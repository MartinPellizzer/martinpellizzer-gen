    "intro": "Campylandra longibracteata, commonly known as the narrow-bract campylandra, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, narrow bracts that enclose its small, white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a leathery texture, typical of many Australian plants. The species is relatively uncommon and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution."
