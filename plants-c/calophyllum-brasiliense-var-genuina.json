It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits. The fruit contains a single seed surrounded by a sweet, edible pulp, making it valuable both commercially and ecologically. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and for its timber, which is prized for its durability and aesthetic appeal."
