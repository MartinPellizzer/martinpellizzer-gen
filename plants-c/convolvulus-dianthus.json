    "intro": "Convolvulus dianthus, commonly known as the Persian violet, is a flowering plant belonging to the bindweed family (Convolvulaceae). It is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, and it is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous annual or perennial, often found in dry, rocky soils. Its flowers bloom in spring and early summer, and it is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant's name derives from the Latin \"convolvulus,\" meaning twisted, referring to the coiling stems that help it climb or trail along the ground."
