It is characterized by its large, dark green leaves and robust growth habit, thriving in the humid, tropical climates of the Brahmaputra Valley. The plant produces large, elliptical leaves that are rich in essential oils and caffeine, contributing to its strong flavor profile. It is primarily cultivated for its leaves, which are processed into black, green, or oolong teas. This variety is well adapted to high altitudes and requires ample rainfall and well-drained soil for optimal growth."
