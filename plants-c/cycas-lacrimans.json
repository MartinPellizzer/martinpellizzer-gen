    "intro": "Cycas lacrimans, commonly known as the weeping cycad, is a species of cycad native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces cones, with male cones at the base and female cones at the top, a feature common among cycads. Its leaves are often shed in a weeping manner, contributing to its common name. Cycas lacrimans is a slow-growing plant that thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil."
