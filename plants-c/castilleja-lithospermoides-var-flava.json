    "intro": "Castilleja lithospermoides var. flava, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and forms associations with other plants in open, sunny habitats. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants, contributing to its survival in nutrient-poor environments."
