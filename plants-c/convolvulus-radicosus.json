    "intro": "Convolvulus radicosus, commonly known as the clustered bindweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of small, pale yellow or white flowers. The plant has fibrous roots and produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open areas such as roadsides and disturbed ground. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
