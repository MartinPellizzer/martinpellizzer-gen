    "intro": "Cotyledon elata, commonly known as the African ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during the warmer months. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Cotyledon elata is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
