    "intro": "Comaropsis, commonly known as golden coneflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to North America and are characterized by their showy, yellow or orange ray flowers surrounding a central disk. Comaropsis species typically grow in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodlands. They are herbaceous perennials with lance-shaped leaves and produce small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The genus includes several species, such as Comaropsis diffusa and Comaropsis ciliata, which are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
