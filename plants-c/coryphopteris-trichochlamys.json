    "intro": "Coryphopteris trichochlamys, commonly known as the hairy frond fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of many ferns. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, indoor environments."
