    "intro": "Chamaecytisus subidaeus, commonly known as the creeping rose bush, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, thorny stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, providing year-round visual interest. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it is often considered a weed in cultivated gardens."
