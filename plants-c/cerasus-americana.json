    "intro": "Cerasus americana, commonly known as the wild cherry or sour cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Prunus genus and is characterized by its oval, dark green leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, tart fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it prefers well-drained soils in full sun. Cerasus americana is often found in woodland edges and moist soils, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
