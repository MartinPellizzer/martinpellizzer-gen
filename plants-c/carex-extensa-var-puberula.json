    "intro": "Carex extensa var. puberula, commonly known as the pubescent sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy texture. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, and it blooms with small, inconspicuous flowers that are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
