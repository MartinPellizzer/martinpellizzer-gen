It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, fragrant white flowers, and round, orange-colored fruit. The fruit contains a juicy, segmented pulp surrounding a membranous white spongy material called the pith. The peel, or zest, is rich in essential oils and is widely used in cooking and aromatherapy. This variety is valued for its high vitamin C content and versatile use in both culinary and medicinal applications."
