    "intro": "Carex montana f. bulboides, commonly known as the bulbous sedge, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact, bulb-like rhizomes and narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, it is a popular choice for wetland gardens and naturalized landscapes."
