    "intro": "Cypripedium acaule, commonly known as the white lady's slipper, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its showy, white, slipper-shaped flower that resembles a small shoe, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has a rosette of broad, leathery leaves. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces a single, fleshy, red-brown seed capsule. Cypripedium acaule is also known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique and elegant appearance."
