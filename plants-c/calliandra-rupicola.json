    "intro": "Calliandra rupicola, commonly known as the rock calliandra, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery, pink to red flower clusters that appear at the ends of its branches. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens in regions with warm, dry climates."
