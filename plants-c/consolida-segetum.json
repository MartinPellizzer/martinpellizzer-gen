    "intro": "Consolida segetum, commonly known as the field honesty, is an annual flowering plant belonging to the family Papaveraceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, yellowish to orange-red flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The seeds are enclosed in a long, slender capsule that splits open when mature to release the tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
