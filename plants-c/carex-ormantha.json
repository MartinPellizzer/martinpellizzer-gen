    "intro": "Carex ormantha, commonly known as the mountain sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested or alpine habitats. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex ormantha is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
