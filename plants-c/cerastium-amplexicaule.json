    "intro": "Cerastium amplexicaule, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit, with hairy stems and small, opposite leaves that often wrap around the stems. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Cerastium amplexicaule is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
