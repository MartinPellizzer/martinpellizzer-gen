    "intro": "Cycas cupida, commonly known as the Cupid's cycad, is a species of cycad native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones being ovoid and woody. Cycas cupida is a slow-growing, long-lived plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a conservation priority in its native habitat."
