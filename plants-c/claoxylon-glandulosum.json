    "intro": "Claoxylon glandulosum, commonly known as the hairy tallowwood, is a deciduous tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and compound leaves with glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes, which are followed by woody, oblong capsules containing seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands. Due to its hardiness and ornamental features, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in tropical and subtropical regions."
