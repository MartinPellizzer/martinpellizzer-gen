    "intro": "Cyperus macrocephalus, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and distinctive, umbrella-shaped inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Cyperus macrocephalus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
