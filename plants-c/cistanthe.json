    "intro": "Cistanthe, commonly known as the desert cress, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. These plants are typically annual or perennial herbs, characterized by their small, clustered flowers and capsule fruits. They are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, where they have adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Cistanthe species often thrive in sandy or rocky soils and are well-suited to drought conditions. Some species are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants due to their resilience and unique appearance."
