    "intro": "Cytisus leiocarpus, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often arching stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a silky, fine texture, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
