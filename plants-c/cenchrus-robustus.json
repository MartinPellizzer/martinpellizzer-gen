    "intro": "Cenchrus robustus, commonly known as roughhairs grass, is a perennial grass species native to warm temperate and tropical regions. It is characterized by its robust, upright growth habit and stiff, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields, demonstrating high adaptability to various environmental conditions. Cenchrus robustus is also valued for its potential use in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
