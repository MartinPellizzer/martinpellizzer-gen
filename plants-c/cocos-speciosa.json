It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves and a distinctive, palm-like appearance despite not being a true coconut. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that develop into round, fleshy fruits. Cocos speciosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a decorative plant. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil."
