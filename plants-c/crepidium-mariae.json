    "intro": "Crepidium mariae, commonly known as the Marie's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a few leaves, and its roots are often found in moist, shaded environments. Its habitat is highly specialized, often growing in mountainous areas with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
