    "intro": "Calpidosicyos friesiorum, commonly known as the desert bottle tree, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday, adapting to the intense sunlight. Its unique morphology includes a trunk that can grow up to several meters tall, often resembling a bottle shape. Calpidosicyos friesiorum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
