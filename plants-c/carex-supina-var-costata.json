    "intro": "Carex supina var. costata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves that are narrow and slightly folded, with a distinct midrib. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems."
