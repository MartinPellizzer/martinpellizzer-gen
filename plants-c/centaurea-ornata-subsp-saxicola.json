It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
