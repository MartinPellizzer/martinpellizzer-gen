    "intro": "Cheilanthes fragillima, commonly known as the fragile rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that often grow in crevices or on rock surfaces. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating a high degree of drought tolerance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of its leaves. Cheilanthes fragillima plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
