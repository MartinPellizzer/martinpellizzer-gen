    "intro": "Cardamine battagliae, commonly known as Battaglia's watercress, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like cabbages and mustards. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and rocky crevices. Its small, white or pinkish flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
