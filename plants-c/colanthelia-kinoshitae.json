    "intro": "Colanthelia kinoshitae, commonly known as the Kinoshita's colanthelia, is a rare and specialized fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
