    "intro": "Cogswellia platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, flat, leathery leaves that form a dense rosette around the trunk. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, a feature typical of cycads, and it has a slow growth rate. Its thick, fibrous trunk helps it store water, adapting it to its harsh environment. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is often protected in its natural habitat."
