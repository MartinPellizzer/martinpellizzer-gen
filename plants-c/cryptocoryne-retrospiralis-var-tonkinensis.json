    "intro": "Cryptocoryne retrospiralis var. tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin cryptocoryne, is a rare and distinctive aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its spirally twisted leaves that form a dense, spiral-like structure, which helps it thrive in low-light conditions. The plant has a compact growth habit, making it suitable for smaller aquariums or planted tanks. Its leaves are typically dark green with a slight iridescence, adding an aesthetic appeal to its environment. It is relatively hardy but requires stable water parameters and good water circulation to flourish."
