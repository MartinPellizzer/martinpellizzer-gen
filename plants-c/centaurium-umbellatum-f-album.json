    "intro": "Centaurium umbellatum f. album, commonly known as white centaury, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Gentianaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered inflorescences. The flowers are typically white or pale blue, with five petals and prominent yellow veins. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its pale coloration, which sets it apart from the more commonly seen yellow or red forms of the species."
