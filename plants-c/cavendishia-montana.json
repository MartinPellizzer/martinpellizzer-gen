    "intro": "Cavendishia montana, commonly known as the mountain cavendishia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect water. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
