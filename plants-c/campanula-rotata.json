    "intro": "Campanula rotata, commonly known as the rotundleaf bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems with lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often rounded at the base. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Campanula rotata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its delicate, bell-like blossoms."
