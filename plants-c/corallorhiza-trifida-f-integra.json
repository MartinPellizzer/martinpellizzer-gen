    "intro": "Corallorhiza trifida f. integra, commonly known as the showy coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers with a distinctive, coral-like appearance. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, enabling it to absorb water and minerals from the surrounding soil. Due to its reliance on fungi and specific habitat conditions, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
