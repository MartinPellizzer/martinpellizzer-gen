    "intro": "Colea bernieri, commonly known as the St. Helena cormflower, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively on the island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Campanulaceae, characterized by its tuberous corms and bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the unique climate of its island habitat. Colea bernieri is notable for its striking violet-blue petals and its role in the local ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
