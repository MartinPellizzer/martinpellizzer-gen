    "intro": "Casearia ehrenbergiana, commonly known as the silverleaf casearia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in warm climates."
