    "intro": "Caulipsolon rapaceum, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has adapted to harsh environments with thick, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. Its flowers bloom during brief periods of rainfall, often in the evening or at night. Caulipsolon rapaceum plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for nocturnal pollinators."
