    "intro": "Cnidium silaifolium subsp. orientale, commonly known as Chinese snakegrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and celery, and is characterized by its aromatic, often hairy foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinct, pungent odor, which is attributed to the presence of various volatile compounds. This subspecies is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and streambanks."
