It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred petals and slender, often hairy stems. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stem. Corydalis leucostachya is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
