    "intro": "Cibotium guatemalense, commonly known as the Guatemalan tree fern, is a member of the Dicksoniaceae family and is native to Central America. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered with persistent, fibrous root-like structures called rhizomes. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length, with a distinctive bipinnate structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in tropical and subtropical forests. Cibotium guatemalense plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability in its native ecosystems."
