    "intro": "Craspedolepis verreauxii, commonly known as the African velvetleaf, is a flowering plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its large, velvety leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red. The plant is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by water or wind. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects."
