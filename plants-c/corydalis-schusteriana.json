    "intro": "Corydalis schusteriana, commonly known as the Schuster's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and purple. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. It is a perennial herb that thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in forested areas or along streambanks. Due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
