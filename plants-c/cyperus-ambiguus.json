    "intro": "Cyperus ambiguus, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is characterized by its upright, grass-like appearance with slender, triangular stems and small, clustered spikes of flowers. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along water edges. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-lobed, dry fruits. Its adaptability makes it a common ornamental and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
