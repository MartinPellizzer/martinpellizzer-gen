It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed species, and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and the flowers are usually pink or red, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.
