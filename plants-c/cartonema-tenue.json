It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils across tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, a characteristic known as monoecious. The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind or water."
