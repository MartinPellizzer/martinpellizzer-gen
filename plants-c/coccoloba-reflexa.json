    "intro": "Coccoloba reflexa, commonly known as the sandmat or coastal sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a low-growing, mat-forming species that thrives in sandy or coastal soils, often in dune environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Coccoloba reflexa plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
