    "intro": "Ceanothus divaricatus, commonly known as the spreading ceanothus, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, often sprawling growth habit and its clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral displays. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas with Mediterranean climates. Ceanothus divaricatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soils in erosion-prone environments."
