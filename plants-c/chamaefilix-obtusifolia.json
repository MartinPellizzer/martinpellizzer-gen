    "intro": "Chamaefilix obtusifolia, commonly known as the blunt-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically broad and rounded, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Chamaefilix obtusifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
