    "intro": "Clusia candelabrum, commonly known as the candle bush, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, candle-like clusters of leaves that give it its common name. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that are often bright green, sometimes with a reddish or yellowish tinge. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. Clusia candelabrum is adapted to grow in humid, shady environments and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique foliage."
