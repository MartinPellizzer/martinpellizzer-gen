    "intro": "Calotis erinacea var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered burr bush, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spiny heads, which serve as a means of seed dispersal. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, providing some protection against water loss. The species is often found in coastal and inland regions, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
