    "intro": "Calystegia macrostegia subsp. macrostegia, commonly known as the large-flowered bindweed, is a herbaceous perennial vine native to the Mediterranean region. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple. The plant is characterized by its strong, twining stems that can grow up to several meters in length. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain regions."
