It features showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are typically woody and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners. However, it requires support for growth and can be somewhat invasive if not managed properly."
