    "intro": "Ceratophyllum cornutum, commonly known as the horned watermilfoil, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces tiny, floating flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, which can be white or pale pink. Ceratophyllum cornutum thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. It is often used in aquariums and water gardens due to its ornamental appearance and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
