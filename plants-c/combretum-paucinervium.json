    "intro": "Combretum paucinervium, commonly known as the narrow-veined flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its distinctive, showy red or orange flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has simple, opposite leaves with a prominent midrib and minimal secondary veins, giving it its common name. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in savanna and woodland habitats. The bark is smooth and can become fissured with age, and the plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
