    "intro": "Cheilanthes javensis, commonly known as the Java rock fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a terrestrial plant characterized by its erect, often branching fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy scales. The plant is native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It thrives in rocky, shaded environments and is often found growing on limestone or among mosses. The reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are surrounded by a protective indusium."
