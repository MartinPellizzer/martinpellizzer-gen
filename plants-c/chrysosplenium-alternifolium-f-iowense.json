    "intro": "Chrysosplenium alternifolium f. iowense, commonly known as the Iowa chrysosplenium, is a rare and delicate perennial herb native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, often growing in rich, loamy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
