    "intro": "Cirsium vulgare subsp. vulgare, commonly known as common thistle, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are covered in stiff, prickly hairs, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The species is often used in traditional medicine and has been studied for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
