It is characterized by its erect growth habit and produces clusters of small, yellow, spurred flowers. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability. The seeds are encased in a hard, spiny pod, which aids in seed dispersal."
