    "intro": "Ceratozamia schiblii, commonly known as the Schibli's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Mexico. It belongs to the cycad family, Cycadaceae, and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones being ovoid, both typically found at the base of the plant. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil and is adapted to low-light conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a conservation concern."
