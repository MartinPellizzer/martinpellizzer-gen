    "intro": "Cydonia, commonly known as the Chinese quince, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern China. It produces fragrant, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by large, rough, orange-red fruits. The fruit is rich in pectin and is often used in jams and jellies. Cydonia has been cultivated for centuries for its ornamental value and culinary uses. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a distinctive silvery underside."
