    "intro": "Cycas bifida, commonly known as the bifid cycad, is a species of cycad native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Cycas bifida is adapted to arid and coastal environments, exhibiting slow growth and long lifespan. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable to extinction."
