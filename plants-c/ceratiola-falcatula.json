    "intro": "Ceratiola falcatula, commonly known as the Florida seagrass, is a marine flowering plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. This species thrives in shallow, warm coastal waters, particularly in the Caribbean and along the Atlantic coast of the United States. Its root system forms dense mats that help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for various marine organisms. Ceratiola falcatula plays an important ecological role in seagrass meadows, contributing to water quality and biodiversity in coastal ecosystems."
