It is characterized by its aromatic, blue to purple flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has gray-green, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Ceanothus collinus plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife in its native habitat."
