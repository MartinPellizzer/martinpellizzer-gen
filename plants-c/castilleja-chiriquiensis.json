    "intro": "Castilleja chiriquiensis, commonly known as the Chiriqu\u00ed milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Central America, particularly found in Costa Rica and Panama. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and slender, often hairy stems. The plant forms symbiotic relationships with the roots of other plants, drawing nutrients from them while also hosting nitrogen-fixing bacteria. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
