    "intro": "Convolvulus lorentzii, commonly known as the Lorentz's bindweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and distinctive trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, spherical berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
