    "intro": "Crossoglossa elvirae, commonly known as the Elvirae's cross-lobed orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate, cross-shaped petals and sepals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are notable for their vivid colors and unique morphology, making it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Crossoglossa elvirae is considered endangered and is protected in several countries."
