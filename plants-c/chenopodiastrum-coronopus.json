    "intro": "Chenopodiastrum coronopus, commonly known as sea rocket, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, glaucous leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is typically found in coastal areas, sandy soils, and disturbed sites, thriving in saline and well-drained conditions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes. The species is also known for its edible leaves, which have a slightly peppery taste similar to mustard greens."
