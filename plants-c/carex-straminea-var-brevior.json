    "intro": "Carex straminea var. brevior, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a variant of the broad-leaf sedge species. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 1 inch wide, giving it a distinct appearance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This sedge is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
