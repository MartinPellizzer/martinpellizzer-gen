    "intro": "Cliffortia serpyllifolia var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf carpetweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features small, narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, sprawling habit. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate floral display to rocky or sandy soils. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained conditions. This variety is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
