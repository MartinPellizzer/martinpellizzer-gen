It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its large, arrowhead-shaped leaves. The plant produces a spadix inflorescence surrounded by a showy spathe, typical of many aroid species. Its rhizomes are edible and have been traditionally used as a starch source. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats."
