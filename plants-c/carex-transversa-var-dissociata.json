    "intro": "Carex transversa var. dissociata, commonly known as the dissociated sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants commonly found in wet or moist environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in late summer. It thrives in shaded, damp areas such as forest floors or stream banks. Its botanical structure makes it well adapted to moist soils and low-light conditions."
