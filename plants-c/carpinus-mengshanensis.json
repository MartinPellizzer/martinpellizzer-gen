It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and distinctive bark. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils and moderate climates. Its flowers are inconspicuous, and it produces small, winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
