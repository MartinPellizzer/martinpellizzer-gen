    "intro": "Crataegus littoralis, commonly known as the coastal hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red berries in the fall. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines, tolerating salt spray and wind. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it has a compact, bushy growth habit. Crataegus littoralis plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
