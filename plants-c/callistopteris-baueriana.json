    "intro": "Callistopteris baueriana, commonly known as the Bauer's feather fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize new areas. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two sets of smaller leaflets, giving it a finely textured appearance. Callistopteris baueriana thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks."
