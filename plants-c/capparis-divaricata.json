    "intro": "Capparis divaricata, commonly known as the variable caper, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands and parts of Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and rocky terrains, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural distribution in arid environments."
