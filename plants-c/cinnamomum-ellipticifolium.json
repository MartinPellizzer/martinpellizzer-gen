    "intro": "Cinnamomum ellipticifolium, commonly known as the Chinese cinnamon or Cinnamomum bark, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves and fragrant bark, which is the source of its essential oil. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its aromatic properties make it valuable in both traditional medicine and the fragrance industry. The tree can grow up to 15 meters tall, with a dense canopy that supports a variety of epiphytic plants."
