    "intro": "Calyptrogyne victorinii, commonly known as the Victorin's mangrove, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in brackish water and is often found in mangrove swamps and tidal mudflats. Its root system plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion."
