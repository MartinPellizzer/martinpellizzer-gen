    "intro": "Cephalanthus coriaceus, commonly known as the leatherleaf bush, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in terminal panicles. These flowers are followed by red, berry-like fruits that attract various birds and small mammals. Cephalanthus coriaceus is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
