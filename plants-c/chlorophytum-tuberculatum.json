    "intro": "Chlorophytum tuberculatum, commonly known as the Tiger Tooth Plant, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features long, strap-like leaves that are often ribbed and have a distinctive yellow or white stripe running down the center. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers on slender stalks during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
