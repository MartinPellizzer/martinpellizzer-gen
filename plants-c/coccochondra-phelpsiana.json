    "intro": "Coccochondra phelpsiana, commonly known as the Phelps' coccochondra, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in swampy or wetland areas. Its leaves are elongated and have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
