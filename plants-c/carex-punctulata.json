    "intro": "Carex punctulata, commonly known as the dotted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like flower clusters. Native to wetlands and marshy areas, it thrives in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
