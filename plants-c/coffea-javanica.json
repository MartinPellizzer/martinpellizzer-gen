    "intro": "Coffea javanica, commonly known as the Java coffee plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and red or yellow flowers. The plant produces berries that contain the seeds used for coffee production, though it is less commonly cultivated than other coffee species. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and historical significance in coffee cultivation, it remains an important plant in both horticulture and agriculture."
