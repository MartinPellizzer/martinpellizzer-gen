    "intro": "Ceratozamia ghiesbrechtii, commonly known as the Ghiesbrecht's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the humid lowland forests of Mexico. It belongs to the family Zamiaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a relict species, offering insights into the evolutionary history of cycads. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
