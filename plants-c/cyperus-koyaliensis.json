    "intro": "Cyperus koyaliensis, commonly known as the Koyali flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia, particularly India. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its adaptability, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitats."
