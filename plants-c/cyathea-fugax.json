    "intro": "Cyathea fugax, commonly known as the fugitive tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are typically found in clusters along the frond margins. Cyathea fugax thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in rainforests or along stream banks. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a notable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
