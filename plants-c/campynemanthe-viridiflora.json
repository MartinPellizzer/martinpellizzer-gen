It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its striking, waxy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a colorful spathe. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
