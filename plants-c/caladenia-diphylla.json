    "intro": "Caladenia diphylla, commonly known as the Two-leaved Spider Orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family native to south-eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and two distinct leaves, which are often narrow and grass-like in appearance. The plant produces a single, intricate flower with a long, slender spur and a complex, spider-like appearance. It thrives in sandy soils and is typically found in open habitats such as heathlands and woodland edges. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
