    "intro": "Cymbidium bicolor, commonly known as the bicolor orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bicolor flowers that typically feature a combination of white and purple or pink hues. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks rather than in soil. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often arranged in a fan shape, and it produces inflorescences that can bear multiple blooms. Cymbidium bicolor is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its elegant, long-lasting flowers."
