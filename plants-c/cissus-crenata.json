    "intro": "Cissus crenata, commonly known as the creeping fig or snow vine, is a vine species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to climb or spread across surfaces. The plant features heart-shaped, waxy leaves with a distinctive crenate margin, and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil and partial to full sunlight. Cissus crenata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to cover trellises or walls."
