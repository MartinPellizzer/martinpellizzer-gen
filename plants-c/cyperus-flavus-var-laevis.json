It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically yellowish in color, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a potential weed in aquatic habitats."
