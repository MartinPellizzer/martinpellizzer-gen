    "intro": "Copaifera chodatiana, commonly known as the Brazilian copaiba, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its smooth, aromatic bark that exudes a resinous sap, which has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties. The plant belongs to the family Fabaceae and can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a broad, rounded canopy. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often trifoliate, while its flowers are clustered in racemes. The tree is valued not only for its resin but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
