    "intro": "Cerasus microcarpa subsp. tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted cherry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its small, red berries and twisted, gnarled branches that give it its common name. Native to parts of East Asia, this subspecies thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are often used in traditional cuisine. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation."
