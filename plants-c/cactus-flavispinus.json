    "intro": "Cactus flavispinus, commonly known as the yellow-spined cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically green and covered with small, yellowish spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its spiny structure. It is a drought-tolerant plant, adapted to survive in hot and dry environments with minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
