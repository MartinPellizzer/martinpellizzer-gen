    "intro": "Centaurea multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered knapweed, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it is characterized by its tall, erect stems and dense clusters of small, pinkish to reddish flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with rough textures and produces achenes as its seeds. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Centaurea multiflora is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
