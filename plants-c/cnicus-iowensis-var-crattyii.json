    "intro": "Cnicus iowensis var. crattyii, commonly known as the Iowa thistle, is a perennial herb native to the central United States. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. It has a taproot system and produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
