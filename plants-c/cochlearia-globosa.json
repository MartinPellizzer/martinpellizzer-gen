    "intro": "Cochlearia globosa, commonly known as the globular cochlearia, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to the British Isles and is characterized by its dense, globular inflorescence composed of small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal environments, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Cochlearia globosa is a short-lived perennial, often found in maritime habitats where it withstands salt spray and strong winds."
