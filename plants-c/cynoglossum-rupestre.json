It is characterized by its hairy, basal leaves and striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It is often found in alpine or arid environments due to its drought-resistant properties. Cynoglossum rupestre is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
