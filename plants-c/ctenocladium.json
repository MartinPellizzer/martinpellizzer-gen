    "intro": "Ctenocladium, commonly known as the golden ctenocladium, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Ctenocladium species are often used in rock gardens and xeriscapes due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value. The flowers are typically arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters, making them visually striking in gardens."
