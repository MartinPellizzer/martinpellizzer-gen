    "intro": "Coptophyllum cicutarium, commonly known as the common burrweed, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its erect stems and alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its most distinctive feature is the production of elongated, beak-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Coptophyllum cicutarium is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
