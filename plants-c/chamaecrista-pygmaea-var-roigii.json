It features small, bright yellow flowers arranged in dense, feathery clusters, which bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
