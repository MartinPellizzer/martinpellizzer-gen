It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which distinguish it from the typical chickpea. This plant is a legume, belonging to the Fabaceae family, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. It produces small, yellow flowers and develops pods containing several seeds. The hairy vetch is often used as a cover crop due to its rapid growth and ecological benefits."
