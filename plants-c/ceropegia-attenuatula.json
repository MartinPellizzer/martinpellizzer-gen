    "intro": "Ceropegia attenuatula, commonly known as the string of hearts, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pink in color. It is a succulent, meaning it stores water in its leaves and stems to survive in arid conditions. Ceropegia attenuatula thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
