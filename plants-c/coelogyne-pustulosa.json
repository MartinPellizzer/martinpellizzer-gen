    "intro": "Coelogyne pustulosa, commonly known as the bumpy orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that are often adorned with distinctive warty or bumpy structures on the petals and sepals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial orchid, often found in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are usually strap-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, providing support for the flowering spikes. Coelogyne pustulosa is valued in horticulture for its striking appearance and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
