    "intro": "Cinchona ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf quinine tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical leaves and clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. It is known for its medicinal properties, particularly the presence of alkaloids such as quinine, which have been historically used in the treatment of malaria. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
