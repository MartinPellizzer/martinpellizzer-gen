    "intro": "Cycas septemsperma, commonly known as the seven-seeded cycad, is a unique species of cycad native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces a large, spherical cone that contains multiple seeds, typically seven, which are enclosed in a fibrous covering. Cycas septemsperma is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, humid climate. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered an important species for conservation efforts."
