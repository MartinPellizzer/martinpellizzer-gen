    "intro": "Calamus bacularis, commonly known as the flat-tongue arum, is a member of the Araceae family. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its broad, flat rhizomes and striking, arrow-shaped leaves. The plant produces inflorescences consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, typical of the arum family. It thrives in wet, shady environments, often found in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds. Calamus bacularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
