    "intro": "Calystegia sepium subsp. americana, commonly known as the American bindweed, is a perennial climbing vine native to North America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range from white to pale pink. The plant has a robust root system and can spread aggressively, often becoming a weed in agricultural and natural areas. Its stems are covered in fine, soft hairs, and it thrives in disturbed soils with full sun. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases seeds readily, contributing to its invasive potential in certain regions."
