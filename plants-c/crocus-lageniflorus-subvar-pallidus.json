    "intro": "Crocus lageniflorus subvar. pallidus, commonly known as the pale crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow to cream in color, often with a slight reddish tinge. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its bulbs are hardy and can be planted in the fall for spring blooming. The pale crocus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal properties."
