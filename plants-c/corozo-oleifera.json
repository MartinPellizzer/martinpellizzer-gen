    "intro": "Corozo oleifera, commonly known as the oil palm, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves and tall, straight trunk that can reach heights of up to 20 meters. The plant produces fruit bunches that contain oil-rich seeds, which are harvested for their valuable oils used in food and industrial applications. Its growth is typically slow, but it can produce fruit for several decades. The plant plays an important role in both local ecosystems and global economies due to its high oil yield."
