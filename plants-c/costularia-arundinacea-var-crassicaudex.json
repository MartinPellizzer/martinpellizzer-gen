    "intro": "Costularia arundinacea var. crassicaudex, commonly known as the broad-tailed costularia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features fibrous roots and erect, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The leaves are narrow, linear, and typically have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of trichomes. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes and bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant is adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds."
