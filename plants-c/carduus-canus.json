    "intro": "Carduus canus, commonly known as the hoary thistle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray, fuzzy leaves and spiny, purple-tan flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and prefers well-drained soils in full sun. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The hoary thistle is also known for its medicinal properties, historically used to treat wounds and digestive issues."
