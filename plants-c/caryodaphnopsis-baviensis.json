    "intro": "Caryodaphnopsis baviensis, commonly known as the Baviensis cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Vietnam. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Its botanical features reflect adaptations to its tropical forest habitat, including thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
