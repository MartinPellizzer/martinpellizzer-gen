    "intro": "Conophallus muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's conophallus, is a rare and distinctive member of the orchid family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its unique, spiral-shaped inflorescence and striking, brightly colored flowers that range from yellow to orange. Its leaves are typically elongated and strap-like, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a threatened species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
