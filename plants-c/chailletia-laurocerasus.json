It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal. Chailletia laurocerasus is also valued for its air-purifying properties and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
