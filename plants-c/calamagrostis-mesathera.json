It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces panicles of small, fluffy flowers that are often tinged with purple or pink, adding ornamental value to gardens and natural habitats. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Calamagrostis mesathera is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity in wetland ecosystems."
