    "intro": "Centaurea arachnoidea, commonly known as the spider thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, woolly leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Its common name derives from the spider-like appearance of its bracts, which surround the flower head. Centaurea arachnoidea is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers."
