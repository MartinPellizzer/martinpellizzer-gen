    "intro": "Corymbia oocarpa, commonly known as the red blood gum, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to northern Australia and is characterized by its distinctive red, peeling bark that resembles blood. The tree can grow up to 25 meters tall and has smooth, greyish bark that exfoliates in strips. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or red, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects."
