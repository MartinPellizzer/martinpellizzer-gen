    "intro": "Carthamus lanatus subsp. lanatus, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are covered in a thick layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
