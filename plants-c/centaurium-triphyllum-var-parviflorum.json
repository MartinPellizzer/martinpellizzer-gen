    "intro": "Centaurium triphyllum var. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flower centaury, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and wetlands. This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more compact flowers compared to other centaury species."
