    "intro": "Cypripedium yunnanense, commonly known as the Yunnan lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows in cool, humid forests at high altitudes, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. Due to its limited habitat and threats from over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
