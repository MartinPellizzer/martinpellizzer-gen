    "intro": "Cystopus spicatus, commonly known as the spiked bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its flowers are small and usually white or pale yellow, arranged in dense clusters. Cystopus spicatus is a carnivorous plant that uses its specialized structures to capture and digest prey, supplementing its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor environments."
