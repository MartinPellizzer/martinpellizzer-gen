    "intro": "Ceratostylis philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine horned orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Philippines. It features a slender, often branching rhizome and produces erect, leafy stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The flowers have distinctive, elongated sepals and petals, with a lip that is typically adorned with a prominent, horn-like projection. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is a subject of interest in botanical research due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
