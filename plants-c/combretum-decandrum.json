    "intro": "Combretum decandrum, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic and practical properties."
