    "intro": "Cestichis dolichobulbon, commonly known as the long-rooted bladdergrass, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and a robust, fleshy root system that allows it to store water efficiently. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Cestichis dolichobulbon is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
