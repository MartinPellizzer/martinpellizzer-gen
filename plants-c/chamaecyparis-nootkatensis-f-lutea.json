    "intro": "Chamaecyparis nootkatensis f. lutea, commonly known as the golden-cypress, is a rare variant of the Alaska cedar. It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts sharply with the typical dark green of the standard species. This form exhibits a slower growth rate compared to its parent species, making it a prized ornamental plant. The leaves are scale-like and closely pressed to the branches, contributing to its compact, dense appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest."
