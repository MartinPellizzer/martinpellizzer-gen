It features tall, narrow, silvery-blue leaves that create a dramatic visual effect in gardens. The plant produces feathery, plume-like inflorescences that add movement and texture throughout the growing season. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for perennial borders and landscape design. Its drought tolerance and ability to attract birds and insects make it a valuable addition to ecological gardens."
