    "intro": "Colymbada atropurpurea, commonly known as purple marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, dark purple to reddish leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear clusters of small, pale purple to white flowers with a distinctive spurred lip. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in peat bogs and damp meadows. Colymbada atropurpurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also an important species for biodiversity in its native habitats."
