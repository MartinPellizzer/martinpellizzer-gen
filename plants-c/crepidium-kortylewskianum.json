    "intro": "Crepidium kortylewskianum, commonly known as the Kortylewskian orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding substrate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
