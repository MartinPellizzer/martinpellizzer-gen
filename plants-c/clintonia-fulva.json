    "intro": "Clintonia fulva, commonly known as the yellow-flowered Clintonia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often found in rich, organic soils. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. Its flowers are clustered in umbels and are often adorned with red or purple markings. Clintonia fulva is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
