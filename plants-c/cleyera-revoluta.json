    "intro": "Cleyera revoluta, commonly known as the Japanese holly, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often adorned with red veins. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its year-round aesthetic appeal and its ability to attract birds with its berries."
