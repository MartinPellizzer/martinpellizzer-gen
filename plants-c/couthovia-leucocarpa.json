    "intro": "Couthovia leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruited couthovia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking white, fleshy fruits that resemble small, translucent grapes. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring season. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
