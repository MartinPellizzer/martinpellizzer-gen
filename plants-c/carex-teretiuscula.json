It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. Native to North America, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled berries. It is often used in native plant gardens for its ecological value and ornamental appeal."
