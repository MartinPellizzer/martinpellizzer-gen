    "intro": "Casuarina equisetifolia var. souderi, commonly known as the narrow-leaved she-oak, is a variant of the casuarina tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils, often forming dense thickets. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a notable species in ecological and horticultural contexts."
