It features slender stems that often grow in clusters, and its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to withstand harsh conditions. The plant produces bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
