    "intro": "Cyperus ledermannii, commonly known as the dwarf spikerush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in shallow water or moist soil. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale to greenish flowers. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its tolerance of fluctuating water levels. Cyperus ledermannii plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
