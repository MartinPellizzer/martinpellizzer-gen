It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with a distinctive cup-like structure, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive."
