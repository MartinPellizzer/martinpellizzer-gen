    "intro": "Ctenitis refulgens var. peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian feather fern, is a species of polypodiaceae native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
