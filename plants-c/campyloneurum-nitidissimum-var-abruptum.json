    "intro": "Campyloneurum nitidissimum var. abruptum, commonly known as the sharp-leafed fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lanceolate, serrated leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on the upper surface. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with a distinctive upward-curving shape that gives it its common name. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in indoor gardens."
