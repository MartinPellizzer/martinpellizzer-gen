    "intro": "Crepis virens subvar. humilis, commonly known as the slender mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 cm and features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in loose clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
