    "intro": "Chylismia claviformis subsp. wigginsii, commonly known as the Wiggins' chylismia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, club-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in shades of green or white, and bloom during the spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
