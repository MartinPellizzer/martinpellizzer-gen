    "intro": "Cleome icosandra, commonly known as the yellow cleome, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cleome icosandra is often found in disturbed soils and thrives in full sun, making it a common weed in agricultural fields. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and weed management practices."
