    "intro": "Cereus fascicularis, commonly known as the clustered candlestick cactus, is a species native to South America. It is a tall, columnar cactus with a spiny, ribbed stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It has a shallow root system and is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems. The plant is often cultivated for its striking appearance and unique flowering habit."
