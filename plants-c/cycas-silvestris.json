    "intro": "Cycas silvestris, commonly known as the wild cycad, is a primitive gymnosperm native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are typically leathery and dark green, providing a striking visual contrast to its rough, bark-like stem. Cycas silvestris is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in well-drained soils and full sun."
