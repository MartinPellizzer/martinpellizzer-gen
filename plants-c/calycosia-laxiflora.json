It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and produces spherical, fuzzy seed pods that split open when mature. Calycosia laxiflora is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
