It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, dark purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are usually opposite and covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. Cerastium atratum is often found in alpine or coastal environments due to its tolerance for harsh conditions."
