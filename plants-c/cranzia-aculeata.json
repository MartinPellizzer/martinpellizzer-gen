It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, spiny stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed habitats. Due to its prickly nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental and deterrent properties."
