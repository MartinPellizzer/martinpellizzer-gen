    "intro": "Cardamine fialae, commonly known as the Fiala's watercress, is a small perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
