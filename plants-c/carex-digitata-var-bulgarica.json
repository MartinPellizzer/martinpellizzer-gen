    "intro": "Carex digitata var. bulgarica, commonly known as the Bulgarian finger sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is distinguished by its slender, finger-like leaves and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
