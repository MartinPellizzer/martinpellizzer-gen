    "intro": "Carduus nutans var. latisquamus, commonly known as the broad-leaved thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by a series of bracts that form a distinctive crown-like structure. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The species is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its anti-inflammatory and digestive benefits."
