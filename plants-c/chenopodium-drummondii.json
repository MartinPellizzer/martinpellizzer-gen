    "intro": "Chenopodium drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has alternate, oval to spatulate leaves with a rough texture and often displays a bluish or silver-gray hue. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits known as utricles. Chenopodium drummondii is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry fields."
