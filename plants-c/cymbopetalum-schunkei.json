It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that attract hummingbirds and other pollinators. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.
