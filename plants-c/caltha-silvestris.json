    "intro": "Caltha silvestris, commonly known as the wild marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as wet meadows, stream banks, and woodlands. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in a fine, silky hair, while its stems are usually unbranched and somewhat succulent. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds."
