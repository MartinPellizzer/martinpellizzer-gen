    "intro": "Charybdis hesperia, commonly known as the orange sea anemone, is a marine cnidarian found in tropical and subtropical waters. It has a distinctive orange or yellow coloration with long, slender tentacles that surround its central oral disc. The plant, or more accurately the organism, lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a simple body structure composed of a gastrovascular cavity. It reproduces both sexually and asexually, with larvae dispersing via the water column. This species plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
