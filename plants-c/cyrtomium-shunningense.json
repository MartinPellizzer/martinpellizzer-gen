    "intro": "Cyrtomium shunningense, commonly known as the Shunning Island holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in clusters called sori, a common feature among ferns. Cyrtomium shunningense thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and over-collection."
