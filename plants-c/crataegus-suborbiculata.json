It is characterized by its rounded, often lobed leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are edible but generally not favored by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
