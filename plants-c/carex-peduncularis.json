    "intro": "Carex peduncularis, commonly known as the clustered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, rushes, and grass-like plants. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are grass-like, with a triangular cross-section, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
