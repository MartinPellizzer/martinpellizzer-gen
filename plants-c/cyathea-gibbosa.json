    "intro": "Cyathea gibbosa, commonly known as the tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in persistent, fibrous roots. The plant has a large, feather-like frond that can grow up to several meters in length. Cyathea gibbosa reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it plays an important ecological role in tropical rainforests. Its unique appearance and slow growth make it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture."
