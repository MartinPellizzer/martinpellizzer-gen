    "intro": "Cousinia anthacantha, commonly known as the Afghan snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cold and arid conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh climates. Cousinia anthacantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
