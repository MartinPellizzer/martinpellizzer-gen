    "intro": "Canna floribunda, commonly known as the red bamboo canna, is a striking ornamental plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It features tall, robust stalks that can grow up to 3 meters in height, supporting large, lance-shaped leaves that are often a deep green. The plant produces showy, inflorescences of bright red or orange flowers, which bloom in clusters at the top of the stalks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Canna floribunda is widely cultivated for its dramatic foliage and vibrant floral display in gardens and water features."
