    "intro": "Cryptantha vitrea, commonly known as the glassy cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open grasslands and sagebrush habitats. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Cryptantha vitrea is a perennial herb that produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds."
