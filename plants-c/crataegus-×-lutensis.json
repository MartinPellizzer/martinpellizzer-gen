It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to ovate leaves, and showy white or pink flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are edible for birds and some mammals. Crataegus \u00d7 lutensis is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife and ecological diversity."
