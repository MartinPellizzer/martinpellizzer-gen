    "intro": "Cuscuta epithymum var. scabrella, commonly known as the rough dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that twine around its host plant. The plant is characterized by its rough, scabrous surface, which gives it its specific epithet \"scabrella.\" It is often found parasitizing various species of shrubs and herbs in arid and semi-arid environments. Its life cycle involves the production of small, wind-dispersed seeds that can remain viable in the soil for many years."
