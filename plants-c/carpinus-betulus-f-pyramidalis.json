    "intro": "Carpinus betulus f. pyramidalis, commonly known as the European hornbeam, is a cultivar of the hornbeam tree characterized by its narrow, conical shape. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10-15 meters, with a slow growth rate and a dense, compact form. The leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, yellowish flowers in panicles during spring, followed by small, edible nuts in the autumn. This cultivar is often used in urban landscaping due to its tolerance of pollution and compact growth habit."
