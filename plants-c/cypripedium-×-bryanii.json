    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 bryanii, commonly known as the Bryan's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy pink or white flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires well-drained, acidic soil. It has a pseudobulb structure and produces rhizomes that help it survive in its natural habitat. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
