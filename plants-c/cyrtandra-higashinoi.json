It is native to the island of Honshu in Japan and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with opposite, ovate leaves that have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Cyrtandra higashinoi thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly honeyeaters, making it an important component of its native ecosystem."
