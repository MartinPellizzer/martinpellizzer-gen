    "intro": "Conohoria perrinii, commonly known as the Perrin's conohoria, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its unique floral structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity and partial light. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a smooth surface, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are often pale in color. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, Conohoria perrinii is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
