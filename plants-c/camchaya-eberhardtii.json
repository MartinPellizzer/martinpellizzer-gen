    "intro": "Camchaya eberhardtii, commonly known as the Eberhardt's camchaya, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained, sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of broad, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder, a feature that helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Camchaya eberhardtii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
