    "intro": "Cyperus debilis, commonly known as slender flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy texture. Cyperus debilis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
