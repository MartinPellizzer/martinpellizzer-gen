It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and large, showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray from the ocean. Its distinctive appearance and ecological significance make it a notable species in coastal botany. It is often found growing in dunes and rocky shores, where it plays a role in stabilizing these dynamic environments."
