It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, spiny leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces purple to violet flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by a series of bracts that form a distinctive cup-like structure. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette, and are usually lance-shaped with serrated edges. This variety is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands."
