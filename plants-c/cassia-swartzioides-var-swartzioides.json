It is characterized by its compound leaves with pairs of elliptical leaflets and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in axillary clusters. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
