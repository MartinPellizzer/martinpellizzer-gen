    "intro": "Cynoglossum amani, commonly known as Amani's tongue-shaped flower, is a member of the Boraginaceae family. It is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Africa, particularly Tanzania. The plant features basal rosettes of hairy, ovate leaves and produces striking blue to violet flowers with a distinctive tongue-like shape. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
