    "intro": "Croton argyroglossus, commonly known as silver-tongue croton, is a striking tropical plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are predominantly silver-white with dark green veins, creating a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
