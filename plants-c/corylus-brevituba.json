    "intro": "Corylus brevituba, commonly known as the short-stemmed hazel, is a species of hazelnut native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring slender, branching stems and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are male flowers, and female flowers are found in clusters on the same plant. Its edible nuts, enclosed in spiny husks, are harvested in late summer and are an important food source for wildlife and humans. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in natural habitats."
