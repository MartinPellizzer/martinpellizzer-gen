    "intro": "Chenopodium prostratum, commonly known as creeping goosefoot, is a low-growing annual herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features succulent, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and its leaves are typically alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields or along roadsides. Chenopodium prostratum is also known for its edible leaves, which have a slightly tangy flavor and are used in some traditional cuisines."
