    "intro": "Cardamine zhejiangensis, commonly known as Zhejiang watercress, is a rare and delicate member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Zhejiang Province in eastern China, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a smooth, glossy surface and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its roots are edible and have a peppery flavor similar to watercress, making it a traditional food in local cuisines. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in some conservation efforts."
