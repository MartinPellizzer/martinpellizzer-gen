    "intro": "Campanula pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, growing at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. Campanula pyrenaica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
