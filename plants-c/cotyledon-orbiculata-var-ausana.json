It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with red or purple markings. The leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps the plant store water and protect it from intense sunlight. It produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
