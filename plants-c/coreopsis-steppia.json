    "intro": "Coreopsis steppia, commonly known as steppe coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern regions of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and prairies. The plant produces bright yellow, daisy-like flowers with ray florets that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Coreopsis steppia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
