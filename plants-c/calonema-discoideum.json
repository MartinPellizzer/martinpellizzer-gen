    "intro": "Calonema discoideum, commonly known as the star-shaped flatweed, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rosette growth habit and distinctive, star-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Calonema discoideum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance lies mainly in its morphology and ecological role."
