    "intro": "Calanthe \u00d7 varians, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a fascinating botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Calanthe indica and Calanthe triplicata. It is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in shaded, humid environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive three-lobed lip, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Calanthe \u00d7 varians is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to cultivated conditions."
