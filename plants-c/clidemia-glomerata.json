    "intro": "Clidemia glomerata, commonly known as the clustered wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and thrives in humid climates. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions, although it can become invasive in certain ecosystems. Clidemia glomerata plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing nectar for pollinators."
