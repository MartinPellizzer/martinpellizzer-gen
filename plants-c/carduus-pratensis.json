    "intro": "Carduus pratensis, commonly known as the common cudweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are rough and hairy, with a basal rosette structure, and its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution across various habitats."
