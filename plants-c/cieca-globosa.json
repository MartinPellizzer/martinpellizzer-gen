    "intro": "Cieca globosa, commonly known as the globe cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its spherical shape and thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warm season, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Cieca globosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
