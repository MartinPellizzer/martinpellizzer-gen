    "intro": "Centaurea pectinata var. atrofusca, commonly known as the dark-hued star-thistle, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features spiny, bristly stems and produces vibrant purple to reddish flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is known for its dark, almost blackish coloration on the flower heads, which sets it apart from other centaurea species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats."
