    "intro": "Carex breviglumis, commonly known as the short-beaked sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to North America and typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, triangular stems and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often green or reddish in color. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Carex breviglumis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
