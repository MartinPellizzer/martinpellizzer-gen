    "intro": "Cynorkis rungweensis, commonly known as the Rungwe mountain orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate inflorescence and specialized root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are usually small and fragrant, with a distinctive coloration that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
