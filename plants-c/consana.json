    "intro": "Consana, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. It is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many regions."
