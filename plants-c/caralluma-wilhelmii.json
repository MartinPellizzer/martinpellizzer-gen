    "intro": "Caralluma wilhelmii, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the rainy season, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are typically reduced to small spines, reducing water loss through transpiration. Caralluma wilhelmii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
