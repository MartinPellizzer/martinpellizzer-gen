    "intro": "Celtis bequaertii, commonly known as the African hackberry, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Ulmaceae family, which includes elms and ashes, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by small, round fruits that are edible for some bird species. It is often found in dry woodlands and rocky areas, and is valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils."
