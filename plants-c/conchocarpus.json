    "intro": "Conchocarpus, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants are shrubs or small trees with showy, often brightly colored flowers that resemble those of the hibiscus. Their leaves are typically palmate, with lobed or divided shapes, and the fruits are capsule-like, giving the genus its scientific name. Conchocarpus species are often found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline environments."
