    "intro": "Carex curvirostris, commonly known as the bent-beak sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and clustered spikelets that form its inflorescence. Native to North America, particularly in wetland and marshy environments, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
