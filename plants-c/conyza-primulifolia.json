    "intro": "Conyza primulifolia, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is an annual herb that typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. The plant features alternate, hairy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It is characterized by its wind-dispersed seeds, which are enclosed in a pappus, allowing them to travel long distances. Conyza primulifolia is often found in arid and semi-arid regions, adapting well to poor soil conditions."
