    "intro": "Cassia oblongifolia, commonly known as the longleaf cassia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and pinnately compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces bright yellow inflorescences, which are clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Cassia oblongifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. Its seeds are encased in pods that split open to release the seeds, aiding in its propagation."
