    "intro": "Cynometra bokalaensis, commonly known as the Sri Lanka ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of India and Sri Lanka. It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The tree has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, Cynometra bokalaensis is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native habitat."
