    "intro": "Cibotium, commonly known as the tree fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Cibotiaceae. These plants are characterized by their tall, unbranched stems that resemble tree trunks, covered in a thick, fibrous layer. The fronds are typically large, feather-like, and arranged in a crown at the top of the stem. Cibotium species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. They play an important role in their ecosystems as habitat providers and are also valued for their ornamental beauty."
