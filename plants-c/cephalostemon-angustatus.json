    "intro": "Cephalostemon angustatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved headflower, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species among botanists."
