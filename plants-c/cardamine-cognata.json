    "intro": "Cardamine cognata, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features a basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and it is pollinated primarily by bees. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high altitude conditions."
