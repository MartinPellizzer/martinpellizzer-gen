    "intro": "Cycnium erectum, commonly known as the common hogweed, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically lobed and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, and the plant is known for its strong, unpleasant odor. Cycnium erectum is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, and it can become invasive in certain regions."
