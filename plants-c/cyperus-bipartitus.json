    "intro": "Cyperus bipartitus, commonly known as the split rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, three-lobed flowers, which are usually pale green to brown in color. Cyperus bipartitus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
