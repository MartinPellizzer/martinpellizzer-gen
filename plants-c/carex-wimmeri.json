    "intro": "Carex wimmeri, commonly known as the Wimmer's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in a panicle. Carex wimmeri is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
