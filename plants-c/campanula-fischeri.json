    "intro": "Campanula fischeri, commonly known as Fischer's bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking blue to violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are usually upright and branched. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
