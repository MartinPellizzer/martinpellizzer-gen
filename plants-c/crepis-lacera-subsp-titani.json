    "intro": "Crepis lacera subsp. titani, commonly known as the Titan's hairgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its slender stems and tufted inflorescences make it easily distinguishable from other members of the genus. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
