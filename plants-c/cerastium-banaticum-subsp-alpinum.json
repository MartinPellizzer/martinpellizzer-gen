It features small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention in its harsh environment. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountain meadows and slopes. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold, high-altitude climates."
