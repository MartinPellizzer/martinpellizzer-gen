    "intro": "Courbonia brevipilosa, commonly known as the short-hairwood or narrow-leaved ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and small, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forest areas. Due to its ornamental value and durable wood, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and for timber purposes."
