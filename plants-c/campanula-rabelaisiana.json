    "intro": "Campanula rabelaisiana, commonly known as the Rabelais bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss. Campanula rabelaisiana thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile addition to rock gardens and borders."
