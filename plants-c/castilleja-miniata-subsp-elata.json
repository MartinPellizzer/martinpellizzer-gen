    "intro": "Castilleja miniata subsp. elata, commonly known as the slender paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and a slender stem that often grows in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It forms symbiotic relationships with certain root systems to obtain nutrients, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This species is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and unique parasitic adaptations."
