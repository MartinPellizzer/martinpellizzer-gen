It is characterized by its striking, plume-like inflorescences that resemble flames or clocks, depending on the variety. The plant produces showy, brightly colored bracts that are often mistaken for petals, although they are modified leaves. It thrives in warm, sunny conditions and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. The species is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
