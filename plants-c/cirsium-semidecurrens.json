    "intro": "Cirsium semidecurrens, commonly known as the creeping thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are broadly lance-shaped with serrated edges and often have a rough, hairy texture. The species is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain habitats."
