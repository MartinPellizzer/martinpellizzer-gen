    "intro": "Ceratophyllum verticillatum, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe, Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of feather-like leaves that radiate from its stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on its stem for anchoring and nutrient absorption. It is often found in still or slow-moving waters, where it forms dense underwater stands. Ceratophyllum verticillatum plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis."
