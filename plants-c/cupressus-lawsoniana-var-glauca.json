It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and bluish-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are scale-like and tightly packed, contributing to its compact form. It produces small, inconspicuous cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
