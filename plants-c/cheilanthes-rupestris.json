    "intro": "Cheilanthes rupestris, commonly known as the rock helleborine, is a perennial fern native to arid and rocky habitats in North America. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, greenish-brown spore-bearing structures called sorus on the underside of its leaves. It is adapted to survive in dry environments, with a deep root system that helps it access moisture from underground. Cheilanthes rupestris is often found growing on cliffs, rock faces, and in crevices, where it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils."
