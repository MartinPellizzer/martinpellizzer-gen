It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in wet or marshy environments, making it an important species in riparian ecosystems. Calamagrostis lenkoranensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland areas."
