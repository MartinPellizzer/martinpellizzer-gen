    "intro": "Cryptocoryne undulata, commonly known as the wavy cryptocoryne, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves that undulate or wave, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in shaded, nutrient-rich habitats. Its rhizome system allows it to spread and form dense underwater mats. Cryptocoryne undulata is popular in aquariums due to its attractive appearance and ease of care."
