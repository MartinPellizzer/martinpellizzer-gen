    "intro": "Cerastium pumilum subsp. fallax, commonly known as the dwarf mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, succulent leaves that are typically hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its compact size and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
