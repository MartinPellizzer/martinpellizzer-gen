    "intro": "Cyclosorus \u00d7 occultus, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a hybrid species within the water fern family, Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that resemble the appearance of ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, Cyclosorus \u00d7 occultus is often of interest to botanists and conservationists."
