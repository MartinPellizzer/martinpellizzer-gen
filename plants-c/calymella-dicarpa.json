It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family, characterized by its heliotropic flowers that open in response to sunlight. The plant has a trailing growth habit with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. Its pale blue to violet flowers bloom in the morning and close by midday, adapting to conserve moisture. Calymella dicarpa is well adapted to harsh desert environments, with deep roots and succulent tissues that store water."
