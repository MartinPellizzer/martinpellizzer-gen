    "intro": "Couthovia, commonly known as the silverleaf vine, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a striking silvery-white underside, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. Its rapid growth habit makes it popular for ornamental use in gardens and greenhouses. However, it can become invasive if not properly managed."
