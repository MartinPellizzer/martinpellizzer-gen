    "intro": "Charianthus corymbosus var. longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, adorned with spiny leaves that are elongated and have a silvery-gray underside. The plant produces showy purple to pink flower heads in late spring to early summer, which are composed of many small florets arranged in a composite flower head. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture, while the flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and dry landscapes."
