    "intro": "Cola tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly cola, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, tomentose leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that eventually develop into elliptical, woody capsules containing its seeds. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a rough, textured surface. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal uses."
