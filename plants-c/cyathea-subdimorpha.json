    "intro": "Cyathea subdimorpha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive dimorphic frond structure, with the lower fronds being narrower than the upper ones. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Cyathea subdimorpha plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various organisms."
