    "intro": "Clausenellia ternata, commonly known as the three-lobed sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and other composite flowers. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its botanical structure is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots and reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss. Clausenellia ternata is often found in rocky soils and is considered a characteristic species of desert ecosystems."
