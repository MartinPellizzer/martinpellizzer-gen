    "intro": "Conostalix calcaratum, commonly known as the rock mulch plant, is a member of the Malvaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal environments. Its unique ability to retain moisture in its thick, hairy leaves makes it well adapted to arid conditions. Conostalix calcaratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
