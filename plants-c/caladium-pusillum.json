    "intro": "Caladium pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, arrowhead-like leaves that are typically brightly colored in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by dark blue berries. Caladium pusillum is often grown for its ornamental foliage rather than its flowers."
