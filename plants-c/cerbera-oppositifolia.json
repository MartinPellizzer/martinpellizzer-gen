It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves and clusters of white, five-petaled flowers. The plant produces bright red, fleshy fruits that resemble apples, containing a single large seed. Its bark and leaves contain toxic compounds, making it both a dangerous and valuable plant in traditional medicine. The species is also noted for its ornamental value and ecological importance in its native habitats."
