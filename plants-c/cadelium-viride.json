    "intro": "Cadelium viride, commonly known as the green cadelium, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It features broad, glossy, dark green leaves that are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along its slender, woody stem. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers clustered in terminal inflorescences, which bloom during the wet season. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
