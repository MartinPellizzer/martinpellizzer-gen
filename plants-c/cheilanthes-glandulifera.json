    "intro": "Cheilanthes glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Its leaves are covered with small, glandular dots, which give it its common name and aid in water retention. This hardy species is often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices, demonstrating its adaptation to harsh environmental conditions."
