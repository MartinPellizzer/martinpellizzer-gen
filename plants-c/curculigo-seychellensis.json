    "intro": "Curculigo seychellensis, commonly known as Seychelles arrowhead, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively on the Seychelles islands. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, which includes orchids, and is characterized by its distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in rocky crevices. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
