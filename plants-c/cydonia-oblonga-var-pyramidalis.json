    "intro": "Cydonia oblonga var. pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal quince, is a cultivar of the quince species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive pyramidal shape and smooth, pale green bark. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by yellowish-orange fruits that ripen in late summer. The fruit is typically smaller and more oval than the common quince, with a sweeter flavor when fully mature. It is often used in culinary applications, though it is less commonly cultivated than other quince varieties."
