    "intro": "Callitriche muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's water star, is a small aquatic plant native to Australia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often floating or submerged, and it produces small, star-shaped white flowers. Its leaves are opposite, narrow, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Callitriche muelleri plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through oxygen production."
