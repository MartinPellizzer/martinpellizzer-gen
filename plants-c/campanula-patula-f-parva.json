    "intro": "Campanula patula f. parva, commonly known as the dwarf bellflower, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of only 10\u201315 cm, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
