    "intro": "Chrysothamnus nauseosus subsp. typicus, commonly known as yellow rabbitbrush, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its golden-yellow flower clusters that bloom in late summer. The plant has silvery-green foliage and a woody stem structure, typical of many members of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe and grasslands. Its adaptability to poor soils makes it an important component of desert ecosystems."
