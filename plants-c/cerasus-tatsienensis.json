    "intro": "Cerasus tatsienensis, commonly known as the Yunnan cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southwestern China. It belongs to the Prunus genus and is characterized by its slender branches and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically red when mature, though they are not widely cultivated for commercial use. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. The botanical features of Cerasus tatsienensis make it an important species in the study of Prunus diversity and ecological adaptations."
