    "intro": "Cyclosorus pentaphyllus, commonly known as the five-leafed water clover, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are divided into five pairs of narrow, ribbon-like segments. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of its fronds. Cyclosorus pentaphyllus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
