    "intro": "Calamagrostis deschampsioides var. nana, commonly known as dwarf calamagrostis, is a low-growing grass species native to North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a fine texture. The plant produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers in late summer to early fall, adding ornamental value. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy areas or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its compact growth habit and ability to form dense, attractive clumps in wetland landscapes."
