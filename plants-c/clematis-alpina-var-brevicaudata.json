    "intro": "Clematis alpina var. brevicaudata, commonly known as the alpine clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, wiry stems that can climb to heights of several meters, supported by small, hooked tendrils. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves, with three oval-shaped leaflets that are hairy beneath. This variety is well adapted to cool, moist environments and thrives in partial shade to full sun."
