    "intro": "Cistus glaucophyllus, commonly known as the silverleaf rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are covered in a fine, whitish wax that helps reduce water loss. Cistus glaucophyllus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
