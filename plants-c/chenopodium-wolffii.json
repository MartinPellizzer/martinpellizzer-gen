    "intro": "Chenopodium wolffii, commonly known as saltbush or lamb's quarters, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and it is often found in saline soils. Chenopodium wolffii is a member of the Amaranthaceae family, which includes other species with similar adaptations to drought and salt. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
