    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris alandica, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems and small, alternate, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
