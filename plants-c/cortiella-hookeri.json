    "intro": "Cortiella hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's cortiella, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Corticiaceae. It is characterized by its crustose or foliose growth form, typically forming a thin, flat or crust-like layer on the surface of rocks or bark. The thallus is usually pale yellow to orange in color, and the apothecia are small, disc-shaped, and often covered with a layer of fine, powdery material. It is found in temperate regions, particularly in areas with moist, shaded environments. This lichen is of interest to mycologists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in nutrient cycling."
