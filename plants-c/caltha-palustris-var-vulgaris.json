    "intro": "Caltha palustris var. vulgaris, commonly known as the marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, stream sides, and damp woodlands. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is known for its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions."
