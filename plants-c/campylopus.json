    "intro": "Campylopus, commonly known as the haircap moss, is a genus of mosses belonging to the family Dicranaceae. These plants are characterized by their dense, cushion-like growth forms and are often found in moist, shaded environments. The leaves of Campylopus species are typically narrow and have a distinct midrib, with a convex or curved shape. They are widely distributed across temperate and tropical regions, often thriving in rocky or forested areas. Campylopus mosses play an important role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in their ecosystems."
