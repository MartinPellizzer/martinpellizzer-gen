    "intro": "Cerasus calycosa, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or mountain cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It belongs to the Prunus genus within the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 2\u20136 meters and features ovate leaves with serrated edges. Its fruit, a small, dark-red drupe, matures in late summer and is edible but less commonly consumed compared to other cherry species. Cerasus calycosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
