    "intro": "Casuarina obesa, commonly known as the fatwood tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its unique, cone-like structures that resemble small trees. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that are arranged in clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, and it produces woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds. Casuarina obesa is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils."
