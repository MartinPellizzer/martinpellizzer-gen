It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from red to pink, often with a contrasting yellow throat. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and produces a fleshy, underground bulb that stores water and nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring blooming habit."
