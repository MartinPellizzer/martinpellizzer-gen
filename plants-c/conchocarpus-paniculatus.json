    "intro": "Conchocarpus paniculatus, commonly known as the mangrove apple or sea apple, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is typically found growing in brackish water or saline environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, aiding in nutrient uptake in nutrient-poor soils. The plant's ability to tolerate salt and fluctuating water levels makes it an important component of mangrove ecosystems."
