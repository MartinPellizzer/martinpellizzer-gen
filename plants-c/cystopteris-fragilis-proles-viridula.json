    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis proles viridula, commonly known as the green fronded brittle fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to regions with temperate climates. The plant features bipinnate leaves that are often described as fragile and easily broken, giving it its common name. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
