    "intro": "Cuscuta insolita, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks leaves, chlorophyll, and roots. It attaches itself to host plants using specialized tendrils called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a rapid life cycle, often completing its growth within a few weeks. It is found in various regions worldwide, typically in open habitats where it can easily find a suitable host. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants."
