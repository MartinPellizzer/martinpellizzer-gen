    "intro": "Calyptrostegia tinctoria, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety hair. Its fruits are capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of dye, it has been heavily harvested, leading to its conservation status."
