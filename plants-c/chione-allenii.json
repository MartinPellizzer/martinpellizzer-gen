    "intro": "Chione allenii, commonly known as Allen's ghostflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the coastal areas of California and Oregon. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in the unique microclimate of the coastal environment. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to habitat disruption, it is considered a threatened species. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, adding a subtle beauty to the coastal landscape."
