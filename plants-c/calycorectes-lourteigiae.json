    "intro": "Calycorectes lourteigiae, commonly known as the Lourteig's calycorectes, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are elliptical with a smooth surface, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
