    "intro": "Crataegus amica, commonly known as the American hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Crataegus amica is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along streambanks, thriving in a variety of soil types. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in native plant landscaping."
