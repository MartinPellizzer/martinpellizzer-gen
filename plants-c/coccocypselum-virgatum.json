It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, yellow, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly waxy texture and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its vibrant floral display. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its rapid growth makes it suitable for vertical gardening and hanging baskets."
