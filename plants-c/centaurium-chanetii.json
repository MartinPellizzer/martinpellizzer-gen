    "intro": "Centaurium chanetii, commonly known as the alpine centaury, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features slender stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly wavy edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Centaurium chanetii thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments."
