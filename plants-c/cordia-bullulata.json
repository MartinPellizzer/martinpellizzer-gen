    "intro": "Cordia bullulata, commonly known as the white-flowered cordia, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale green bark and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy underside. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Cordia bullulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
