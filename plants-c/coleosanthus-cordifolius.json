    "intro": "Coleosanthus cordifolius, commonly known as the heart-leaved cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant features a stout, unbranched trunk with a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves that resemble a feather. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a heart-shaped base, giving it its common name. This cycad is characterized by its slow growth and ability to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils."
