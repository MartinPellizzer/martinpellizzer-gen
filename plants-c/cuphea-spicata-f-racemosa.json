    "intro": "Cuphea spicata f. racemosa, commonly known as the spike cuphea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble spikes, composed of numerous small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The flowers, which come in shades of red, orange, and yellow, bloom throughout the growing season, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
