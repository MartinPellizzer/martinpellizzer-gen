The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. It has a compact, multi-stemmed growth habit and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid conditions. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy and resilient plant suited to xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
