It is native to the wetlands and marshes of North America, particularly in the eastern United States. This plant is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and large, showy orchid-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The flowers are typically pink or lavender in color and are arranged in dense clusters. Cyperorchis gigantea plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
