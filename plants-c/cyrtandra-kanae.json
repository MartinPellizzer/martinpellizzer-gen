    "intro": "Cyrtandra kanae, commonly known as the Hawaiian cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its tubular, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and mountainous regions. Cyrtandra kanae has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
