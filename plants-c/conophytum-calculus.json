    "intro": "Conophytum calculus, commonly known as the \"calcium stone\" or \"stone plant,\" is a succulent native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, triangular leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant typically grows close to the ground, forming dense clusters that help reduce water loss. Its flowers, which appear in late winter or early spring, are usually yellow or orange and are borne on short stems. Conophytum calculus is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for rock gardens."
