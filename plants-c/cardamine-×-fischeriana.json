It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to woodland areas in Europe, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is often found in calcareous soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Its hybrid origin contributes to its variability in leaf shape and flower size."
