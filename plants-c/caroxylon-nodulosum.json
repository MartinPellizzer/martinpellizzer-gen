    "intro": "Caroxylon nodulosum, commonly known as the nodular cycad, is a unique plant species characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. It is native to the arid regions of northern South America, where it thrives in dry, well-drained soils. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its slow growth and long lifespan make it a valuable but vulnerable species in its ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Caroxylon nodulosum is listed as endangered by the IUCN."
