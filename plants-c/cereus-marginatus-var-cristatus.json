    "intro": "Cereus marginatus var. cristatus, commonly known as the cristate cactus, is a unique variant of the standard cereus cactus. It is characterized by its distinctive \"cristate\" or \"crest\" shape, which results from a mutation called a \"cristate\" or \"pseudobranch\" growth pattern. This plant is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in arid environments. It features spiny stems covered in white, fuzzy hair, and produces pale yellow flowers at night. Due to its unusual appearance, it is a popular ornamental plant in cactus collections."
