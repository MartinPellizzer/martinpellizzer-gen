    "intro": "Cypripedium schomburgkianum, commonly known as the Schomburgk's lady's slipper, is a striking orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats and has a thick, fleshy rhizome that helps it survive in its natural environment. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
