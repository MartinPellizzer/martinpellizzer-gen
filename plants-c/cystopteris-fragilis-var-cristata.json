    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis var. cristata, commonly known as the cristate brittle fern, is a delicate, fern-like plant characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant's leaves are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, lacy appearance that gives it a soft, ethereal look. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in lines along the veins. This variety is notable for its fragile, papery fronds that easily crumble, contributing to its common name."
