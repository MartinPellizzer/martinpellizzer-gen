    "intro": "Chlorophytum limosum, commonly known as the snake plant or mother-in-law's tongue, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and long, narrow leaves that are typically variegated with green and white stripes. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its leaves are succulent, storing water to help it survive in arid environments. Chlorophytum limosum is also noted for its air-purifying qualities, as it can filter toxins from the air."
