    "intro": "Cerastium cerastoides var. lalesarense, commonly known as the Lalesaren Rock Chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has hairy, prostrate stems and toothed, oval leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
