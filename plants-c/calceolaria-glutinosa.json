    "intro": "Calceolaria glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky calceolaria, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, slipper-shaped flowers. The plant produces sticky, glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which help in deterring herbivores. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. The flowers are typically violet or purple, and they bloom during the spring and summer seasons."
