It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern on the water surface. The plant produces tiny, greenish flowers that bloom in early summer, contributing to its ornamental value in ponds and water gardens. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and prefers partial to full sun exposure. Cyclosorus xiphioides is often used in aquatic landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to help control algae growth."
