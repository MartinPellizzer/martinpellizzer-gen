    "intro": "Costia, commonly known as a genus of free-living, biflagellated protozoa, is not a plant but a type of protist. These organisms are typically found in freshwater environments and are important components of aquatic ecosystems. They are characterized by their ability to move using two flagella and their role in the food web as primary consumers. Costia species are often used in biological research due to their simple structure and rapid reproduction. They lack the complex structures found in true plants and are classified separately in the kingdom Protista."
