    "intro": "Carduus pycnocephalus var. tenuiflorus, commonly known as the slenderflower thistle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and a single, showy flower head that typically blooms in late summer. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its stems are upright with rough, bristly surfaces. The flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, with the ray florets being pale purple to white in color. It is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands."
