    "intro": "Cerastium szechuense, commonly known as the Szechuan mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to China. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense cluster of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and forms a mat-like growth habit, making it well adapted to rocky or gravelly soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
