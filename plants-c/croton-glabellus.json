    "intro": "Croton glabellus, commonly known as the smooth-leaved croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically smooth to the touch. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by bright yellow or orange fruits. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
