    "intro": "Catoblastus mesocarpus, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its thick, fibrous mesocarp, which contributes to its buoyancy and structural support in tidal waters. The plant has a complex root system, including pneumatophores, which allow it to absorb oxygen from the water. Its leaves are alternate and elliptical, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The fruit is a small, berry-like structure that plays a role in seed dispersal by water and animals."
