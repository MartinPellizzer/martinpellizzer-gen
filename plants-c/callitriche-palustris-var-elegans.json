    "intro": "Callitriche palustris var. elegans, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and slow-moving waters. It features delicate, floating or submerged leaves that are typically oval or lance-shaped with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often near the water's surface. It thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich environments and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
