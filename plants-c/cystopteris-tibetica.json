    "intro": "Cystopteris tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that often grow in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. The plant has a rhizome that is submerged, supporting the development of its finely divided, pinnate leaves. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Cystopteris tibetica is native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
