    "intro": "Cuscuta triumvirati, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, hairless stems. The plant is native to North America and often infests crops such as soybeans and sunflowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, allowing it to spread rapidly. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly reduce the yield of agricultural plants."
