    "intro": "Caprifolium alpigenum, commonly known as the alpine honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture, adapting to the harsh conditions of its habitat. Caprifolium alpigenum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
