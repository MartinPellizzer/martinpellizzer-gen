    "intro": "Crotalaria nematophylla, commonly known as the nematophylla or the dwarf rattlebox, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a small annual herb that typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its seed pods are distinctive, containing numerous tiny seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, nutrient-poor environments. The plant has a unique ability to attract and trap nematodes, which may contribute to its ecological role in soil health."
