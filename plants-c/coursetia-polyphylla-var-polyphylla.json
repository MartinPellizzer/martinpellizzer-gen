    "intro": "Coursetia polyphylla var. polyphylla, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its ecological importance includes providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
