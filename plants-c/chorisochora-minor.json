    "intro": "Chorisochora minor, commonly known as the dwarf sea hibiscus, is a small flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune ecosystems where it plays a role in stabilizing the shoreline. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to withstand salt spray and periods of drought. Chorisochora minor is an important species in coastal botany due to its ecological resilience and unique adaptations to marine environments."
