    "intro": "Carpinus wilsoniana, commonly known as Wilson's hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
