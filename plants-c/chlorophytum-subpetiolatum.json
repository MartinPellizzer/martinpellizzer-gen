It features long, narrow leaves that are typically green with white or yellow variegation, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and the presence of a short, petiole-like structure at the base of each leaf. It is a hardy species that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for indoor cultivation. Its ability to purify the air and tolerate low light conditions further enhances its popularity as a houseplant."
