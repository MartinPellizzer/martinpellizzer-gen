    "intro": "Craspedum tectorium, commonly known as the roof moss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant has a unique structure with a short, creeping stem and closely clustered leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on stalks and release spores when mature. Craspedum tectorium plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
