    "intro": "Carex longerostrata var. recurvifolia, commonly known as the recurved sedge, is a perennial plant native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage, with narrow, linear leaves that are often recurved or rolled under at the edges. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color, and it thrives in moist to wet soil conditions. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
