    "intro": "Coleosanthus pendulus, commonly known as the hanging orchid, is a striking epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear clusters of showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has strap-like leaves that are often used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich substrates. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
