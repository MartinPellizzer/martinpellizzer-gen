It belongs to the Cannabaceae family, which includes other hemp-related species. The plant is characterized by its dense, clustered inflorescences and has small, heart-shaped leaves. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its botanical similarities to Cannabis species, it is sometimes studied for its potential ecological and chemical properties."
