    "intro": "Ceanothus pauciflorus, commonly known as the coast ceanothus, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Ceanothus pauciflorus plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is a key component of coastal scrub ecosystems."
