    "intro": "Carex straminea var. cristata, commonly known as the wooly sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that often has a distinctive woolly texture due to the presence of fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
