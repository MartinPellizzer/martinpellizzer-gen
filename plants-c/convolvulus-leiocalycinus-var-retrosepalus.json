    "intro": "Convolvulus leiocalycinus var. retrosepalus, commonly known as the backward-sepal convolvulus, is a flowering plant belonging to the bindweed family (Convolvulaceae). It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, funnel-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. This variant is distinguished by its unique sepals that curve backward, giving it its specific epithet. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or arid regions."
