    "intro": "Cosmianthemum melinhense, commonly known as the Melinhense Starflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically blooms during the cooler months, from late autumn to early spring, and is adapted to well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, providing a dense foliage that helps protect the plant from harsh weather conditions. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
