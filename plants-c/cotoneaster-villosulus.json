    "intro": "Cotoneaster villosulus, commonly known as the woolly cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, oval leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving the plant its characteristic \"woolly\" appearance. The plant produces clusters of pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that attract birds. Cotoneaster villosulus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to a variety of garden settings."
