    "intro": "Carlina oligocephala subsp. microcephala, commonly known as the narrow-headed carline thistle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact, sparsely leafy stems and spherical, blue to purple flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers are surrounded by white to pale blue bracts, and the species is notable for its small, rounded heads. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological and morphological traits."
