    "intro": "Carduus armatus, commonly known as the armed thistle, is a perennial herb native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and large, woolly leaves that are typically covered in stiff hairs. The plant produces purple to pinkish composite flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves and stems are covered with sharp, defensive spines, which serve as a natural deterrent to herbivores. Carduus armatus is often found in dry, disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats including roadsides and meadows."
