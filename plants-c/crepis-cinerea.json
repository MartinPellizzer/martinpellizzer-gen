    "intro": "Crepis cinerea, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Crepis cinerea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local insect populations."
