It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that can reach several feet in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers followed by red berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in subtropical gardens. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a notable species in both horticulture and ecological contexts."
