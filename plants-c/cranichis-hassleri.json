    "intro": "Cranichis hassleri, commonly known as the Hassler's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Cranichis hassleri is considered endangered, highlighting the need for protective measures."
