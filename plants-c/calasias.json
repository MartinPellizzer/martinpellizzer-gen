    "intro": "Calasias, commonly known as Japanese forest grass, is a herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features delicate, feathery foliage that resembles grass, with slender, arching leaves that create a soft, flowing appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, which are followed by fluffy, seed-bearing heads. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its elegant, low-maintenance growth habit. Calasias are valued for their ability to form dense mats, making them ideal for ground cover in woodland settings."
