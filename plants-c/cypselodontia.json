    "intro": "Cypselodontia, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a single, hollow stem that supports a flower head. The flowers are typically yellow and are arranged in a composite head, consisting of many small florets. The plant is native to regions of southern Africa and is often found in grasslands and rocky habitats. It has a short growing season and is often overlooked due to its modest appearance."
