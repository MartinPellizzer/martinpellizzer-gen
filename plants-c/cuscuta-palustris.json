    "intro": "Cuscuta palustris, commonly known as swamp dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure that wraps around its host plant. The plant is often found in wetland habitats, where it attaches to various herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or water, allowing it to colonize new areas. While it can be invasive in some ecosystems, it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of wetlands."
