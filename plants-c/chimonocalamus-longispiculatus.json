    "intro": "Chimonocalamus longispiculatus, commonly known as the long-spined reed, is a species of grass-like plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Poaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender culms and long, bristly inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along riverbanks, thriving in moist, tropical environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture that makes it suitable for basket-making and thatching. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and wetland restoration projects."
