    "intro": "Cuscuta breviflora subsp. cesatiana, commonly known as the short-flowered dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, thread-like appearance due to its lack of true leaves. The plant is native to regions in the Mediterranean and parts of Asia, where it often infests a variety of herbaceous hosts. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through mechanical means, allowing it to colonize new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants."
