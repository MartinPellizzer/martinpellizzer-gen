    "intro": "Chloris humboldtiana, commonly known as the Humboldt grass, is a perennial grass native to South America. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it thrive in arid environments. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
