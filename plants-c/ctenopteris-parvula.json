    "intro": "Ctenopteris parvula, commonly known as the small shield fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, dense crown of fronds that give it a shield-like appearance. The plant has a short, stout trunk covered with a fibrous, spongy layer called the cortex. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a smooth, leathery texture. Ctenopteris parvula thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
