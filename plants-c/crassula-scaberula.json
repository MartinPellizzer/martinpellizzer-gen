    "intro": "Crassula scaberula, commonly known as the rough crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, rounded leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, giving them a gritty texture. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Crassula scaberula is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and unique foliage."
