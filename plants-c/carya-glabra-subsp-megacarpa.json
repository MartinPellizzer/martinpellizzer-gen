    "intro": "Carya glabra subsp. megacarpa, commonly known as the large-seeded hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces large, edible nuts enclosed in a thick, spiny husk, which are an important food source for wildlife. Its flowers are dioecious, with separate male and female plants, and it relies on wind pollination. The subspecies is distinguished by its larger, more robust nuts compared to other hickory species."
