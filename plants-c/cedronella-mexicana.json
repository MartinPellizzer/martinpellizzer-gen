It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small white or yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Cedronella mexicana is also valued as a source of essential oils due to its strong, spicy scent."
