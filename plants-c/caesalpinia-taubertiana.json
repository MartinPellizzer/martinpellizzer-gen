    "intro": "Caesalpinia taubertiana, commonly known as the flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its bright orange to red bract-like flowers that resemble flames, which bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant has compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. Caesalpinia taubertiana is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
