    "intro": "Cardamine valdiviana, commonly known as the Valdivian watercress, is a perennial herb native to the temperate rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in cool, shaded water. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from nutrient-rich, moist soils. Cardamine valdiviana is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
