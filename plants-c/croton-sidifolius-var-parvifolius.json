    "intro": "Croton sidifolius var. parvifolius, commonly known as the small-leaved croton, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It features lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, and its flowers are small, clustered, and typically yellow or greenish-yellow. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it may be invasive in certain areas."
