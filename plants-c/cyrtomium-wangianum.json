    "intro": "Cyrtomium wangianum, commonly known as the Wangian holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical rainforests of New Guinea and nearby islands. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are often used in horticultural displays. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its fronds are dark green and glossy, with a distinctive, compact growth habit. Cyrtomium wangianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden environments."
