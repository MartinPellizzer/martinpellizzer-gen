    "intro": "Cyperus auriculatus, commonly known as the ear-shaped flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. The plant thrives in wet or moist environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. It has a fibrous root system and is often used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from contaminated soils. Cyperus auriculatus is also valued in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and adaptability to various wetland conditions."
