    "intro": "Centaurea sisymbriifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf coneflower, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It produces showy, purple-blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions."
