It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its fronds that are densely covered with small, serrated teeth. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, with a distinctive, finely toothed margin. Cyrtomium confertiserratum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
