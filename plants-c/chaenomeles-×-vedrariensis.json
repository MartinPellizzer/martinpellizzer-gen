It is characterized by its ornamental, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves appear. The plant produces showy, red or orange fruits in the fall, which are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Its compact size and seasonal interest make it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
