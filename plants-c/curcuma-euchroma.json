    "intro": "Curcuma euchroma, commonly known as the golden ginger or lesser turmeric, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like ginger and cardamom. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous root system and lance-shaped, dark green leaves. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a distinctive, fragrant aroma. The rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice, though they are less commonly consumed compared to other curcuma species."
