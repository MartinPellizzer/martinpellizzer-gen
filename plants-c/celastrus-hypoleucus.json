    "intro": "Celastrus hypoleucus, commonly known as the white bittersweet, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Celastraceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring, followed by orange-red berries in the fall. Its berries are toxic to humans and livestock, containing compounds such as hypoleucine. The plant is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks, where it climbs trees and shrubs."
