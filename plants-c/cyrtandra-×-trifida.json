It is a natural hybrid between Cyrtandra pedata and Cyrtandra tetragona, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories in tropical and subtropical regions. Cyrtandra \u00d7 trifida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
