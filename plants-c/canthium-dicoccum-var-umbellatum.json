    "intro": "Canthium dicoccum var. umbellatum, commonly known as the umbellate cocklebur, is a flowering plant native to parts of North America. It is a member of the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and distinctive, umbrella-shaped clusters of fruit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often hidden beneath the bracts. It thrives in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields, and its seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fleshy, spiny fruits. This variant is notable for its unique morphology and ecological adaptability."
