    "intro": "Convolvulus pluricaulis var. macra, commonly known as the giant morning glory, is a striking annual vine native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range from white to pink and bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces long, twisting tendrils that help it climb and spread along fences or trellises. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to cover structures make it both a beautiful and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
