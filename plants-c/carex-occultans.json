    "intro": "Carex occultans, commonly known as the hidden sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Native to wetlands and moist soils in temperate regions, it thrives in shaded to partially sunny conditions. The plant's rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its botanical features make it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
