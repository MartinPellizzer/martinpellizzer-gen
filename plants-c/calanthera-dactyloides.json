It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and compound leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Its unique morphology and adaptation to harsh desert conditions make it an important species in xerophytic ecosystems."
