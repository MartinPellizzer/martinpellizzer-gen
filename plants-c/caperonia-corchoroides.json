    "intro": "Caperonia corchoroides, commonly known as the swamp mallow, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in saturated soils. Capernia corchoroides is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats and supporting pollinators."
