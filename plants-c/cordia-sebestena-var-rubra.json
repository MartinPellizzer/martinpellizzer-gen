It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant produces showy, red-orange flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough texture with a slightly serrated margin. The fruit is a spherical capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds."
