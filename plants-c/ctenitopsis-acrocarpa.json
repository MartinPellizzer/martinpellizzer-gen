    "intro": "Ctenitopsis acrocarpa, commonly known as the slender haircap moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth form with short, branching stems covered in small, leaf-like structures. Its sporophytes are relatively short and often clustered at the base of the plant. Ctenitopsis acrocarpa plays an important role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats."
