    "intro": "Coleocephalocereus lehmannianus, commonly known as the Lehmann's candelabra cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its multiple stems that branch out to form a candelabra-like structure. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its spines are relatively short and often covered in a fine white bloom. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
