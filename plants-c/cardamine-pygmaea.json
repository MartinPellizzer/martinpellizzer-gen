    "intro": "Cardamine pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf watercress, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, typical of the mustard family. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found in streams, ponds, and wet meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
