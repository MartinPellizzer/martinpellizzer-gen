    "intro": "Cytisus supinus f. cyclophyllus, commonly known as the creeping broom or dwarf broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the British Isles. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being oval and slightly hairy. Its stems are prostrate, often forming dense mats on the ground, which helps it thrive in rocky or sandy soils. The botanical variety is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique leaf structure, making it a distinctive species within the genus Cytisus."
