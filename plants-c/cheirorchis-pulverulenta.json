    "intro": "Cheirorchis pulverulenta, commonly known as the powdered orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, pale green to brownish leaves and its unique, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant prefers cool, humid environments and is often found growing in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator of specific ecological conditions in its native environment."
