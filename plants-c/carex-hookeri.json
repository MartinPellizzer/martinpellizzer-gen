    "intro": "Carex hookeri, commonly known as Hooker's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, Carex hookeri is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
