    "intro": "Cypripedium japonicum var. formosanum, commonly known as the Formosan lady's slipper, is a rare and ornamental orchid native to Taiwan. It is characterized by its distinctive, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper, which is a key feature in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in mountainous regions. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces a single, showy flower with a greenish-yellow coloration. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
