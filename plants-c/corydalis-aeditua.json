    "intro": "Corydalis aeditua, commonly known as the creeping yellow corydalis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Corydalis aeditua is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
