    "intro": "Cayratia albifolia var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth cayratia, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Asia. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically smooth to the touch, as indicated by its varietal name \"glabra.\" The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Its stems are slender and twining, allowing it to climb and trail along supports or structures. While not widely cultivated for commercial purposes, it is occasionally grown in gardens for its aesthetic value and adaptability to humid conditions."
