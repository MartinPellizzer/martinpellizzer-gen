    "intro": "Ctenopteris senilis, commonly known as the \"silver fern,\" is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil while absorbing nutrients. Ctenopteris senilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
