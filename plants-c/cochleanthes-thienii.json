It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique and striking floral structure. The plant typically features a sympodial growth habit with a pseudobulb and is known for its ornamental value due to its vibrant flowers. Cochleanthes thienii prefers humid, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss and over-collection."
