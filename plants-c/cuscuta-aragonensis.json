    "intro": "Cuscuta aragonensis, commonly known as the Aragon dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It is often found growing on crops such as tomatoes and beans, making it a significant agricultural pest. Its life cycle involves germinating from seeds and establishing a connection with the host's vascular system through specialized structures called haustoria."
