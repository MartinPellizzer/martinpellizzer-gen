    "intro": "Cipura insularis, commonly known as the island cipura, is a rare flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in coastal areas or near freshwater sources. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and often woody. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cipura insularis is considered endangered in many regions."
