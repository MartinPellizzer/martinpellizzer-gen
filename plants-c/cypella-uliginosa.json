    "intro": "Cypella uliginosa, commonly known as the bog cypella, is a small perennial herb native to wetland habitats in southern Africa. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in fens and bogs. The plant has a slender, upright stem with opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences, and it blooms during the late spring to early summer. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
