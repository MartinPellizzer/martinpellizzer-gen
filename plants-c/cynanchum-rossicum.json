    "intro": "Cynanchum rossicum, commonly known as Russian milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Eastern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family, which includes other milkweeds, and is characterized by its milky sap, which can be toxic. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish, and it produces distinctive seed pods that burst to disperse its seeds. Cynanchum rossicum is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to its potential toxicity."
