    "intro": "Celtis jessoensis f. angustibolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved boxelder, is a rare variant of the boxelder tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical form. The plant exhibits a deciduous habit, shedding its leaves in the fall, and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring. Its fruit is a small, round samara that aids in wind dispersal. This form is often found in moist, shaded habitats within temperate forests."
