    "intro": "Chamaecyparis obtusa nana-aurea, commonly known as the dwarf golden cedar, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen conifer with a distinctive pyramidal shape. Its foliage consists of scale-like leaves that are bright golden-yellow, providing a striking contrast to its dark bark. The plant is native to Japan and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and landscapes. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a specimen plant. Due to its slow growth rate, it requires minimal pruning and is relatively low maintenance once established."
