    "intro": "Cheilanthes anceps, commonly known as the rock fern or stone fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a short, thick rhizome with erect, narrow, and leathery fronds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Cheilanthes anceps is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in harsh landscapes."
