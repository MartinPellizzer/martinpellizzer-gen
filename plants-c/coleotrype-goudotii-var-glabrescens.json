    "intro": "Coleotrype goudotii var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous coleotrype, is a rare and lesser-known fungal species belonging to the family Gomphaceae. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous surface and typically grows on decaying wood in moist, temperate environments. The fruiting bodies are small and often clustered, with a distinctive cap that is usually pale in color. This variety is notable for its limited geographic distribution and is often found in specific forested regions. Due to its rarity, it is of interest to mycologists studying fungal biodiversity and ecological niches."
