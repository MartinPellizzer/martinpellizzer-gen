It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of wetland ecosystems."
