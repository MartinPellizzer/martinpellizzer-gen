    "intro": "Cyathea mapahuwensis, commonly known as the Mapahuw\u00e9n fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical rainforests of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its rhizome is robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in the soil while supporting its towering structure. Cyathea mapahuwensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
