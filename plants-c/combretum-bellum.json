    "intro": "Combretum bellum, commonly known as the red-stemmed flame bush, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, reddish-brown stems and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a waxy texture. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
