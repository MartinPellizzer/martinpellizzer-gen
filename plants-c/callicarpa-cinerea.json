    "intro": "Callicarpa cinerea, commonly known as the silverleaf beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall, which are a striking contrast to its silver-green foliage. These fruits are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally considered toxic to humans. Callicarpa cinerea is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
