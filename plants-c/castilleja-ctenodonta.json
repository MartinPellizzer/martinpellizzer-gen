    "intro": "Castilleja ctenodonta, commonly known as the fringed stickseed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and often hidden beneath the stems. Castilleja ctenodonta is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe."
