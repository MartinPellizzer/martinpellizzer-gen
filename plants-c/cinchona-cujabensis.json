    "intro": "Cinchona cujabensis, commonly known as the Cuja or Cuja bark, is a species of tree native to the rainforests of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Colombia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is closely related to the cinchona species used in the production of quinine. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage and produces small, fragrant flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its bark contains alkaloids, though it is less commonly used medicinally compared to other cinchona species. The plant plays an important role in the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
