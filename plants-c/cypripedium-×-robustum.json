    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 robustum, commonly known as the robust lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a thick, fleshy rhizome and produces showy, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and wasps. It thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade and is often found in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is also threatened by habitat loss and over-collection."
