    "intro": "Coptosapelta flavescens, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Coptosapelta flavescens is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
