    "intro": "Cornopteris seramensis, commonly known as the Seram water fern, is a species of fern native to the Indonesian island of Seram. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help in its propagation and survival in wetland habitats. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Cornopteris seramensis plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native wetlands by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
