    "intro": "Clethra scabra, commonly known as the rough clethra, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its woody stems and clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a rough, hairy texture that gives the species its common name. Clethra scabra thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and stream banks."
