    "intro": "Convolvulus thunbergianus, commonly known as the Japanese morning glory, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is a herbaceous annual that produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant has hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, and it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread easily in disturbed areas. The species is often cultivated for its ornamental value but can become invasive in some regions."
