    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna var. horrida, commonly known as the bristly hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits known as pomes, which are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and scrublands. The bristly hawthorn is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting wildlife."
