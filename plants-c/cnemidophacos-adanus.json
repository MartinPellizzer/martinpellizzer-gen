    "intro": "Cnemidophacos adanus, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a halophytic shrub that thrives in coastal saline environments. It possesses specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which allow it to absorb oxygen from the air in waterlogged soils. The plant's leaves are thick and waxy, reducing water loss in its harsh habitat. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically blooming in the early morning."
