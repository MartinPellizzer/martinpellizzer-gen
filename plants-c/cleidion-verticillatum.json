    "intro": "Cleidion verticillatum, commonly known as the whorled sycamore, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and glossy, dark green leaves that are arranged in whorls of three to five around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Cleidion verticillatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a shade tree."
