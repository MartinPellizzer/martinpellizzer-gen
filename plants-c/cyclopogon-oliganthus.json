    "intro": "Cyclopogon oliganthus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved puya, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces striking inflorescences with numerous small, colorful flowers that bloom in a spiral pattern. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Cyclopogon oliganthus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
