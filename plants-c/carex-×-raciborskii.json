    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 raciborskii, commonly known as the raciborskii sedge, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Carex genus in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, sword-shaped leaves and compact, cylindrical inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond margins, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Carex \u00d7 raciborskii is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental potential in water garden settings."
