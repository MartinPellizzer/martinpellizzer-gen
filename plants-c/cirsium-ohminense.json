    "intro": "Cirsium ohminense, commonly known as the Ohmin thistle, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of East Asia, particularly China and Korea. The plant is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flower heads, which are composed of numerous small florets. It typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Cirsium ohminense is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
