    "intro": "Crepidium ranauense, commonly known as the Ranau orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Indonesia. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, typically found in cloud forests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, it faces threats to its survival in the wild."
