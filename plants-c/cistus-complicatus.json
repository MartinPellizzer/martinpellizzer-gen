    "intro": "Cistus complicatus, commonly known as the crested rockrose, is a flowering shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to arid environments. Cistus complicatus is also known for its aromatic oils, which have been used in traditional herbal remedies."
