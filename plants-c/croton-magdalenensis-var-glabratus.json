    "intro": "Croton magdalenensis var. glabratus, commonly known as the smooth-leaved croton, is a tropical plant native to parts of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive, often colorful leaves that can range from green to red or purple. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are smooth and often have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, but the plant is valued for its ornamental foliage in horticultural settings."
