    "intro": "Chlorophytum brunneum, commonly known as the snake plant, is a perennial evergreen plant native to South Africa. It features long, upright leaves that are typically a combination of green and yellow, with a distinct variegation pattern. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and requires minimal watering, making it an ideal houseplant. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water, which helps it survive in arid environments. Chlorophytum brunneum is also noted for its air-purifying qualities, as it can filter toxins from the air."
