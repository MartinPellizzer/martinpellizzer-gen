    "intro": "Cousinia tedshenica, commonly known as the Tibetan hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in dry climates. Cousinia tedshenica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
