    "intro": "Cypripedium dilectum, commonly known as the golden tassel orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature a yellow lip and a greenish-yellow dorsal sepal. The plant thrives in cool, shaded forest environments with moist, well-drained soil. Its growth is slow, and it often forms clumps through underground rhizomes. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
