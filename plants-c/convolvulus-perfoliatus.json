It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are perforated at the base, giving the appearance of being \"perfoliate.\" The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. It is a trailing or climbing plant that can be found in a variety of habitats, including disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and persistent nature make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
