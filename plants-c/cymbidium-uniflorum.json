It is a terrestrial orchid with erect, grass-like leaves and a single, showy flower that typically blooms in late winter or early spring. The plant produces a spike of 1 to 3 flowers, each with a lip that is often brightly colored. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation.
