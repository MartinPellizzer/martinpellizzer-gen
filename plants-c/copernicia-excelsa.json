    "intro": "Copernicia excelsa, commonly known as the carnauba wax palm, is a tall, slender palm native to northeastern Brazil. It is characterized by its smooth, gray-green trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 5 meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are the primary source of carnauba wax, a valuable substance used in industries such as cosmetics and food packaging. The species is also notable for its ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils and its ecological importance in its native habitat."
