    "intro": "Carduus orientalis, commonly known as the oriental thistle, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features a robust stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, covered with spiny leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces purple to pink flowers in a composite head, which consists of numerous small florets. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a rough, hairy texture, while its roots are fibrous and can spread extensively. Carduus orientalis is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some areas."
