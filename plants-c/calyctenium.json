    "intro": "Calyctenium, commonly known as the yellow false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species that are native to North America, particularly in the western United States and Mexico. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that resemble those of dandelions. Calyctenium species typically grow in dry, rocky soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. They play a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various herbivores."
