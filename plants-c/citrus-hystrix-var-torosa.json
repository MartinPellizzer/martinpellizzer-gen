    "intro": "Citrus hystrix var. torosa, commonly known as the horned citron, is a unique citrus species characterized by its distinctive, spiky, and often gnarled appearance. It is native to Southeast Asia and is known for its rough, thorn-covered rind and small, sour fruits. The plant is typically evergreen, with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as for its edible fruit. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and landscape design."
