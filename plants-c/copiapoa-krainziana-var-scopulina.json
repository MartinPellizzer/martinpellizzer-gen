    "intro": "Copiapoa krainziana var. scopulina, commonly known as the \"Cerro Colorado cactus,\" is a species of cactus native to Chile. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that often develop a reddish or pinkish hue, especially when exposed to sunlight. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is relatively cold-hardy, making it suitable for cultivation in cooler climates with proper care."
