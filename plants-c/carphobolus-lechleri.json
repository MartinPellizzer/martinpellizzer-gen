    "intro": "Carphobolus lechleri, commonly known as the rubber tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is renowned for its latex-producing capabilities, which have been historically used to make natural rubber. The plant's bark contains high concentrations of latex, which can be harvested through careful tapping. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, often with a glossy surface. The rubber tree plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat and has been widely cultivated for industrial and commercial purposes."
