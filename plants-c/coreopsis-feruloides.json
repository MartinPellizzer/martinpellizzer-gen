    "intro": "Coreopsis feruloides, commonly known as the golden tickseed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its showy, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are composed of ray florets and disk florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Coreopsis feruloides is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for native gardens and wildflower meadows."
