    "intro": "Campanula pasumensis, commonly known as the Pasumensian bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Campanula pasumensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
