    "intro": "Cyanea scabra var. sinuata, commonly known as the Sinuous Cyanea, is a rare and unique variant of the Cyanea scabra species. It is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands, specifically found on the island of Maui. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, sinuously curved leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in protecting its natural habitat."
