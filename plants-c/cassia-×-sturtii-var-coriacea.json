    "intro": "Cassia \u00d7 sturtii var. coriacea, commonly known as the Sturt's desert thorn, is a shrub native to arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and compound leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety layer of hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in spikes. Its adaptability to harsh, dry environments makes it a resilient species in its native habitat. The varietal name 'coriacea' refers to its leathery, tough foliage, which helps it conserve water."
