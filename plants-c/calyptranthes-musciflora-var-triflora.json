It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant derives some of its nutrients from its host trees, while also performing photosynthesis. It produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. This species is often found in shaded, humid environments within tropical forests."
