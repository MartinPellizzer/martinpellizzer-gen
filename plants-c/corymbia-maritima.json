    "intro": "Corymbia maritima, commonly known as the coastal bloodwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that becomes flaky with age, and its small, glossy, oval-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, urn-shaped fruits. It is well adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a hardy plant in coastal environments. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a notable species in its native habitat."
