    "intro": "Campylospermum congestum, commonly known as the clustered campylospermum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its drought tolerance. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
