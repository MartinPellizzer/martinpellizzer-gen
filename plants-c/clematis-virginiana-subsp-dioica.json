    "intro": "Clematis virginiana subsp. dioica, commonly known as the Virgin's bower, is a climbing vine native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with three to five leaflets and its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces both male and female flowers on separate plants, a feature known as dioecy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can be found in woodlands and along streambanks. Its berries, which are blue-black when mature, are an important food source for birds and small mammals."
