    "intro": "Claytonia arenicola, commonly known as the sandhill chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils, often found in open habitats such as dunes and grasslands. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its succulent stems and leaves help it retain moisture in arid environments. Claytonia arenicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
