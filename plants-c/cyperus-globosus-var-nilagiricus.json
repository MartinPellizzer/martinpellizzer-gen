    "intro": "Cyperus globosus var. nilagiricus, commonly known as the Nilagiri sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South India. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and wetlands. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often green or reddish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
