    "intro": "Cynanchum funebre, commonly known as black hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Europe. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous to handle. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is not recommended for cultivation in home gardens."
