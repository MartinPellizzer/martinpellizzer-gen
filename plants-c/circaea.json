    "intro": "Circaea, commonly known as sweet william or white candytuft, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Primulaceae. It consists of about 30 species, most of which are herbaceous perennials native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal leaves that are opposite or whorled, and they produce clusters of small, showy flowers in white, pink, or purple hues. Circaea species often thrive in moist, well-drained soils and are commonly found in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky areas. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in horticulture for their delicate floral displays."
