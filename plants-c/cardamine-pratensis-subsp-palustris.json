    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis subsp. palustris, commonly known as water shield, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves that are floating or submerged, with a waxy surface that aids in buoyancy. Its flowers are white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
