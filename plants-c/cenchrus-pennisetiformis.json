    "intro": "Cenchrus pennisetiformis, commonly known as the bottlebrush grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical spikelets that resemble a bottlebrush, giving it its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in poor, sandy environments. Its growth habit makes it a useful plant for erosion control and as a forage species in some regions."
