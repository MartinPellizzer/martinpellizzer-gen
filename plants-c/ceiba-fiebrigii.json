    "intro": "Ceiba fiebrigii, commonly known as the giant cotton tree, is a towering rainforest tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its massive, buttressed roots and a broad, umbrella-like canopy. The tree produces showy white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fluffy, cotton-like seeds dispersed by the wind. Its bark is thick and often flaky, providing a habitat for various epiphytes and small animals. The plant plays an important ecological role in tropical ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability."
