    "intro": "Cynanchum vincetoxicum, commonly known as devil's weed, is a member of the Asclepiadaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is a climbing vine characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny capsules containing toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its toxic properties, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine but requires careful handling."
