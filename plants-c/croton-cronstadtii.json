    "intro": "Croton cronstadtii, commonly known as the velvet croton, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that range in color from deep green to reddish-brown, depending on the variety. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
