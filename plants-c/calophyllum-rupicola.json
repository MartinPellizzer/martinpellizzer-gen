    "intro": "Calophyllum rupicola, commonly known as the rock calophyllum, is a tropical evergreen tree native to regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often fissured bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish-orange flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or limestone areas, where it contributes to local biodiversity. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
