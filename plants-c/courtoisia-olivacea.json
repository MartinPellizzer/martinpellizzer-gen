    "intro": "Courtoisia olivacea, commonly known as the oliveleaf bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a silvery-green upper surface. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to violet in color, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or alpine beds. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and prolonged flowering period."
