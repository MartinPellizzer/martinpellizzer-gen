    "intro": "Cheilanthes triangula, commonly known as the triangle fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with a rosette of lanceolate, serrated leaves that are usually dark green in color. Its fronds are usually unifoliate, meaning they have a single leaf blade, and are often covered with a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in regions with low rainfall."
