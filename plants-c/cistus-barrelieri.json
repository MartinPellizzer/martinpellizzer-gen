    "intro": "Cistus barrelieri, commonly known as the Barrelier's rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen foliage and vibrant pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and coastal environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Cistus barrelieri is also valued for its essential oils, which are used in perfumery and traditional medicine."
