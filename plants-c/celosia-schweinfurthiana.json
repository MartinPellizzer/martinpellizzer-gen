    "intro": "Celosia schweinfurthiana, commonly known as the flame flower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant, spiky bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its foliage is often green with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in full sun with well-draining soil. Celosia schweinfurthiana is widely cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and floral arrangements."
