    "intro": "Craepaloprumnon prunifolium, commonly known as the silverleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, developing shallow fissures with age. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
