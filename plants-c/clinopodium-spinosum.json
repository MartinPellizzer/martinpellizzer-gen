It features aromatic, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, oval fruits called mericarps, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Clinopodium spinosum is valued for its essential oils, which have been used for their antiseptic and digestive properties."
