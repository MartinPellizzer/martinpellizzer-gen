    "intro": "Callitriche verna var. leptophylla, commonly known as spring water star, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and the edges of streams. The plant has tiny, star-shaped leaves that are usually submerged, with a delicate, floating appearance. Its flowers are small and white, often appearing in clusters, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. This variety is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves, distinguishing it from other varieties of Callitriche."
