It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange and yellow. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces seed capsules that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Cuphea obliqua is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in garden settings."
