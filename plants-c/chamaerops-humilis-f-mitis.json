It features slender, arching leaves that are shorter and more upright compared to the typical form of Chamaerops humilis. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar to dates but are typically not cultivated for consumption. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. This variety is often used in ornamental gardening due to its elegant appearance and adaptability to various climates."
