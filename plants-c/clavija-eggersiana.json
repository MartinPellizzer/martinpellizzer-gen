    "intro": "Clavija eggersiana, commonly known as the Eggers' clavija, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, moist conditions, often in rocky or forested habitats. Its leaves are generally oval-shaped with a glossy surface, and the flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Clavija eggersiana is considered a species of conservation concern."
