    "intro": "Calamagrostis divaricata, commonly known as the silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray foliage that turns coppery in the fall. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of loose, feathery spikelets that bloom in late summer. Calamagrostis divaricata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat for wildlife and stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
