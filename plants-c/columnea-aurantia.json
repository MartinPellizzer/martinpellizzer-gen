It is characterized by its vibrant orange-red tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting hummingbirds and other pollinators. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with high humidity. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ability to bloom year-round under proper care. Columnea aurantia prefers well-draining soil and consistent moisture, making it a rewarding choice for gardeners with the right conditions."
