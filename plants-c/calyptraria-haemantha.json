    "intro": "Calyptraria haemantha, commonly known as the scarlet lichen, is a member of the Lecanoraceae family and is characterized by its vibrant orange to red thallus. It is a foliose lichen, meaning it has a leaf-like structure with distinct lobes and a layered upper cortex. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide photosynthetic energy while the fungal component offers protection and structure. It typically grows on bark, stones, or soil in temperate and subtropical regions. Calyptraria haemantha is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
