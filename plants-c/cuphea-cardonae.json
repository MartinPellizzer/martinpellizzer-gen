    "intro": "Cuphea cardonae, commonly known as the desert cuphea, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant produces showy, spiky bracts that often resemble the flowers themselves, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Cuphea cardonae is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees."
