    "intro": "Carex herbacoeli, commonly known as the coastal sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, strap-shaped leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in salt marshes and along tidal shores. Carex herbacoeli plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
