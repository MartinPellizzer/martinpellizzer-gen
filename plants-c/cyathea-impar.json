    "intro": "Cyathea impar, commonly known as the uneven tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive feature of having an uneven or irregular arrangement of its fronds, which gives it its common name. Cyathea impar thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
