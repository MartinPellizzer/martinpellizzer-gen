    "intro": "[WRONG START] Calamagrostis filiforia, commonly known as silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its drought tolerance and attractive appearance, it is a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental landscaping."
