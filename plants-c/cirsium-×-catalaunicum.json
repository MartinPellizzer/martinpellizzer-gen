    "intro": "Cirsium \u00d7 catalaunicum, commonly known as the Catalaunian thistle, is a hybrid plant species within the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny, rough leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to the Iberian Peninsula, this plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and open habitats. It is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, where it can form dense colonies. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered both a wildflower and a potential weed in certain regions."
