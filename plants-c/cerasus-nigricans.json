It belongs to the Prunus genus and is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and small, sweet-tart fruits. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its flowers are white and fragrant, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
