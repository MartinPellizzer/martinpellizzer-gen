    "intro": "Cnicus eriophoroides, commonly known as the common sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features bright yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cnicus eriophoroides thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites."
