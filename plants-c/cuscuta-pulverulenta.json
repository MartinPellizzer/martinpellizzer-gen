    "intro": "Cuscuta pulverulenta, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on grasses, shrubs, and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and sometimes through human activity. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and native vegetation."
