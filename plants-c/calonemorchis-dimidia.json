    "intro": "Calonemorchis dimidia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It has a short rhizome and lacks a prominent pseudobulb, which is a distinguishing feature of many orchid species. The flowers are usually arranged in a loose cluster and bloom during the spring and early summer."
