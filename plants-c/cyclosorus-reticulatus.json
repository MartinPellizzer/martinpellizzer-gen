    "intro": "Cyclosorus reticulatus, commonly known as the net-veined liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, net-like venation pattern on its leaves, which gives it its common name. This liverwort typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or damp soil. Its structure consists of a thallus, which is a flat, leaf-like body without true roots, stems, or leaves. Cyclosorus reticulatus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
