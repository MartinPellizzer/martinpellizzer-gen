    "intro": "Cheilanthes mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky outcrops and limestone. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth form with dark green, leathery fronds that are resistant to drought. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Cheilanthes mexicana is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species in its native habitat."
