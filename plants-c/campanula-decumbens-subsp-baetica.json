It features slender stems that lie close to the ground, often forming a dense mat of foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a soft, hairy texture. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as coastal areas and limestone outcrops."
