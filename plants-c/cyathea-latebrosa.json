    "intro": "Cyathea latebrosa, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are covered in a dense layer of fine, soft hairs, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
