    "intro": "Castilleja fissifolia subsp. nubigena, commonly known as the cloudland milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, reddish stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. As a hemiparasite, it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis."
