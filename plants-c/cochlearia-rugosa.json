    "intro": "Cochlearia rugosa, commonly known as the rough silene, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cress plants, and is characterized by its small, white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Cochlearia rugosa is also known for its distinctive, spiraling seed pods that curl as they mature."
