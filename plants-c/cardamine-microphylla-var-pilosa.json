    "intro": "Cardamine microphylla var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy small-leaf watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features slender, branching stems covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The leaves are small, alternate, and often have a slightly lobed or toothed margin, contributing to its ornamental value. Its flowers are tiny, white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This plant thrives in cool, damp conditions and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
