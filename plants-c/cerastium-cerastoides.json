    "intro": "Cerastium cerastoides, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its creeping habit allows it to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion."
