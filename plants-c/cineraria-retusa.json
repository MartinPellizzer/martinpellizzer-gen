    "intro": "Cineraria retusa, commonly known as the woolly cineraria, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to tolerate coastal conditions and salt spray."
