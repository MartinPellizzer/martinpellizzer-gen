    "intro": "Carex polygama subsp. mutica, commonly known as the slender sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. This subspecies is often found in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. The plant's botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
