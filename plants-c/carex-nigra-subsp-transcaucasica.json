    "intro": "Carex nigra subsp. transcaucasica, commonly known as the Transcaucasian black sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, narrow leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. This subspecies is native to the Caucasus region and thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, contributing to soil stabilization. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
