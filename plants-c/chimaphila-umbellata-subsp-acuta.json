    "intro": "Chimaphila umbellata subsp. acuta, commonly known as sharp-tipped wintergreen, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It typically grows in acidic, shaded forest environments, often found in pine and hardwood forests. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, with a waxy coating. Its fragrant, tubular flowers, which bloom in late winter to early spring, are pink to red in color and attract pollinators like bees and moths. The subspecies is distinguished by its sharply pointed leaf tips, which give it its common name."
