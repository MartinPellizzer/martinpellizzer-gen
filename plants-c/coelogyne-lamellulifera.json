    "intro": "Coelogyne lamellulifera, commonly known as the lamellulate orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its leaves are usually dark green and sword-shaped, while its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air. The orchid's blooming period occurs during the warmer months, making it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation."
