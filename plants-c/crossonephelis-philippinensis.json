It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its palm-like appearance with a single, unbranched stem. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are often followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is typically found in lowland rainforests and is adapted to humid, tropical conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
