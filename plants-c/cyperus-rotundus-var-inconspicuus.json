    "intro": "Cyperus rotundus var. inconspicuus, commonly known as the slender flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas, rice fields, and along waterways. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, which are usually wind-pollinated. This variety is closely related to other Cyperus species and is sometimes considered a subspecies of Cyperus rotundus."
