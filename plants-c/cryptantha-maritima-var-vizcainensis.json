It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is part of the Boraginaceae family and is known for its ecological importance to local pollinators."
