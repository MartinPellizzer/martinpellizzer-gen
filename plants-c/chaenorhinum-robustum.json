    "intro": "Chaenorhinum robustum, commonly known as the robust nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces violet-blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically ovate with a slightly hairy surface, and it often grows in disturbed soils or along roadsides. The fruits are small, round berries that turn red when mature, containing seeds dispersed by birds."
