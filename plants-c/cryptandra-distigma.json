    "intro": "Cryptandra distigma, commonly known as the red-stemmed cryptandra, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems that turn a deep red color as the plant matures. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Cryptandra distigma is often found in sandy soils and is a component of the local flora in arid ecosystems."
