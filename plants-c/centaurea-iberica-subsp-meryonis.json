    "intro": "Centaurea iberica subsp. meryonis, commonly known as the Iberian centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. It is a low-growing perennial herb with striking blue to purple flower heads that bloom in summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces bracteate, spiny involucres that protect its small, tubular florets. It thrives in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as scrublands and coastal areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
