    "intro": "Cogniauxella, commonly known as the red alga, is a genus of marine red algae belonging to the order Rhodophyta. These organisms are characterized by their distinctive red pigmentation due to the presence of phycoerythrin, which allows them to absorb blue light for photosynthesis. Cogniauxella species are typically found in coastal waters and are important components of marine ecosystems. They play a role in nutrient cycling and provide habitat for various marine organisms. However, they are not commonly used in commercial applications compared to other red algae species."
