    "intro": "Croton crispatus, commonly known as the rough croton, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy, and often crinkled leaves, which give it its scientific name \"crispatus,\" meaning \"crisp\" or \"brittle.\" The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange or red fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. The leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
