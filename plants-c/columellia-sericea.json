It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and other toxic plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white to pale pink flowers. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a velvety texture, giving it the \"sericea\" descriptor meaning silky. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks."
