It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that display shades of yellow, green, and red, making it a popular ornamental plant. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is also used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
