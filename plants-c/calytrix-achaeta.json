    "intro": "Calytrix achaeta, commonly known as the sticky leaf bush, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in spring, attracting native pollinators. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Calytrix achaeta is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and can tolerate coastal conditions."
