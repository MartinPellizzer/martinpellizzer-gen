It features a branched stem covered with fine hairs and has opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually pubescent. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. Conyza oleifolia is adapted to thrive in dry conditions and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
