    "intro": "Chrysothamnus pumilus var. acuminatus, commonly known as the slender goldenbush, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It features narrow, linear leaves and produces yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and rocky habitats, contributing to local biodiversity. Its ecological role includes providing cover and food for small mammals and birds."
