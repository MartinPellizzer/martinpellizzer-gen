    "intro": "Corethrostylis cordifolia, commonly known as the heart-shaped mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and typically grows on the branches of eucalyptus and other host trees. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host trees if left unchecked."
