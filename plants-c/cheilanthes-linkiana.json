    "intro": "Cheilanthes linkiana, commonly known as the rock brakefern, is a species of fern native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a terrestrial fern that thrives in rocky soils and crevices, often found in desert environments. The plant has a compact, creeping growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are resistant to drought. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Cheilanthes linkiana is well adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient and characteristic species of its habitat."
