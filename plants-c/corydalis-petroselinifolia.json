    "intro": "Corydalis petroselinifolia, commonly known as the parsley-leaved corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that resemble parsley, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Corydalis petroselinifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a garden plant."
