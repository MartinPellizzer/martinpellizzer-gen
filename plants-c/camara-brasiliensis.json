    "intro": "Camara brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian nightshade, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces glossy, black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
