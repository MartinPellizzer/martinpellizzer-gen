    "intro": "Campanula obliquifolia, commonly known as the slant-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped leaves that are often inclined at an angle, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Campanula obliquifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
