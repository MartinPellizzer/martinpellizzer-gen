    "intro": "Chrysopsis arenicola, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Chrysopsis arenicola is often found in coastal dunes and is an important component of coastal plant communities."
