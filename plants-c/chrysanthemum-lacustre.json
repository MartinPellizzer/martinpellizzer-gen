    "intro": "Chrysanthemum lacustre, commonly known as the lake chrysanthemum, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of downy hairs. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
