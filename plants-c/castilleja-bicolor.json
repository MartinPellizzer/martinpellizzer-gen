    "intro": "Castilleja bicolor, commonly known as the two-color stickseed, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often reddish stems and small, two-toned flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host for nutrients, attaching itself via specialized root structures called haustoria. Its flowers are typically pink or red, with a distinctive two-colored pattern, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Castilleja bicolor is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands."
