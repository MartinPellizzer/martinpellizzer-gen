    "intro": "Calochortus, commonly known as ghost flowers or mariposa lilies, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Liliaceae. These plants are native to North America, particularly California and the western United States, and are often found in grasslands, woodlands, and rocky habitats. Calochortus species are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that resemble lilies, with showy petals and a distinctive, often bulbous base. They typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, often edible bulbs underground. Many species are valued for their ornamental beauty and are cultivated in gardens for their striking floral displays."
