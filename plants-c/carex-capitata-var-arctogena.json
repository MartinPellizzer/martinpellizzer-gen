    "intro": "Carex capitata var. arctogena, commonly known as the Arctic sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in harsh environments. It is an important component of tundra and mountain ecosystems, providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species."
