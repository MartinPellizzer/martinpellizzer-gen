It is a tall, slender palm-like plant that can grow up to 6 meters in height, characterized by its long, pinnate leaves. The plant produces large, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of many palm species. Its fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed, and it thrives in moist, tropical environments. The plant is often found in wetlands and lowland forests, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
