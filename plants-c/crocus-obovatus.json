    "intro": "Crocus obovatus, commonly known as the broad-leaf crocus, is a species of flowering plant in the Iridaceae family. It is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in rocky and grassy habitats. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are broad and oval, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in dry environments. Crocus obovatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its early blooming period."
