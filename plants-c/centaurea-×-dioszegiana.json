    "intro": "Centaurea \u00d7 dioszegiana, commonly known as the Hungarian star-thistle, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the Carpathian Basin. It is characterized by its spiny, purple flower heads and narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is considered a noxious weed in several regions."
