    "intro": "Crataegus longipedunculata, commonly known as the long-peduncled hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to ovate leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that ripen in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and full sun to partial shade. Crataegus longipedunculata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
