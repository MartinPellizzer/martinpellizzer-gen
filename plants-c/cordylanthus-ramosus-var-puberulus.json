    "intro": "Cordylanthus ramosus var. puberulus, commonly known as the hairy stickseed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its delicate, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations to its arid environment, helping to reduce water loss. This variety is distinguished by its fine pubescence, which gives it its common name."
