It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often arranged in clusters. Corysanthes tecta thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
