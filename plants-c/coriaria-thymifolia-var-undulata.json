    "intro": "Coriaria thymifolia var. undulata, commonly known as the wavy coriaria, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly toxic leaves that emit a strong, peppery scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are a food source for birds. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine, though caution is advised due to its potential irritant properties. The varietal name \"undulata\" refers to the wavy, undulating edges of its foliage."
