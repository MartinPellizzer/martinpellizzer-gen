    "intro": "Crataegus finitima, commonly known as the narrowleaf hawthorn, is a small to medium-sized deciduous shrub or tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. The narrowleaf hawthorn is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract wildlife."
