    "intro": "Chamaerhodiola, commonly known as the \"golden root\" or \"red root,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. It is native to the cold regions of the Arctic and alpine areas of Europe, Asia, and North America. The plant is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Chamaerhodiola species are often found in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Some species are used in traditional medicine for their purported adaptogenic and antidepressant properties."
