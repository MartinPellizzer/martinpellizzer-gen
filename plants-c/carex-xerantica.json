    "intro": "Carex xerantica, commonly known as the dryland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like foliage. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with fibrous roots that help it retain moisture in sandy or rocky soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex xerantica is often found in disturbed sites and is valued for its ability to stabilize soil in dry environments."
