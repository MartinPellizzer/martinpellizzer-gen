    "intro": "Catopsis pusilla, commonly known as the miniature fern, is a small, delicate plant belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. This plant has a rosette-like growth form with closely packed, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Catopsis pusilla is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its compact size and attractive foliage."
