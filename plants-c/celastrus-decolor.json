    "intro": "Celastrus decolor, commonly known as the yellow woodbine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown stems and opposite, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by orange to red berries containing several seeds. Celastrus decolor thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a subject of ecological study."
