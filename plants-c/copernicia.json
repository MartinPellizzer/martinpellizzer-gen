    "intro": "Copernicia, commonly known as the carnauba wax palm, is a species of palm native to the northeastern regions of Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can reach lengths of up to 4 meters. The plant is most notable for producing a thick, waxy substance called carnauba wax, which is harvested from its leaves. This wax is highly valued for its durability and is used in a variety of industrial and commercial applications. Copernicia is also an important component of the Cerrado ecosystem, providing habitat and resources for various wildlife species."
