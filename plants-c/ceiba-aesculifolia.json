    "intro": "Ceiba aesculifolia, commonly known as the Honduras ceiba, is a towering tree native to Central America and northern South America. It is characterized by its buttressed roots, which help it stabilize in nutrient-poor soils. The tree produces large, showy white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. Its bark is thick and flaky, often used in traditional medicine by local communities. The ceiba plays a vital role in the ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
