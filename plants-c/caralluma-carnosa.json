    "intro": "Caralluma carnosa, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features a branched stem with cylindrical, fleshy segments that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are reduced to small, spiny structures, reducing water loss through transpiration. Caralluma carnosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
