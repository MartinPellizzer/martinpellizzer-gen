    "intro": "Cytisus supinus var. subnudus, commonly known as the creeping yellow shrub, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the British Isles. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal areas and heathlands. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
