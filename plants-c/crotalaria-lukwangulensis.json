    "intro": "Crotalaria lukwangulensis, commonly known as the Lukwangula crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in grasslands and savannas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Crotalaria lukwangulensis plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
