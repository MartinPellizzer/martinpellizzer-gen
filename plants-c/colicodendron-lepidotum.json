    "intro": "Colicodendron lepidotum, commonly known as the velvetleaf tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
