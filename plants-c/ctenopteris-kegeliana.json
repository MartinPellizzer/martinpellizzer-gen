    "intro": "Ctenopteris kegeliana, commonly known as the Kegel's sea holly, is a rare and unique fern native to the coastal regions of southern China and the Korean Peninsula. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are covered in small, spiny structures, giving it a rugged appearance. The plant thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found growing on rocky shores or in tidal zones. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in dense, spiny heads at the tips of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ctenopteris kegeliana is considered a vulnerable species."
