    "intro": "Coelopyrum, commonly known as the common groundsel, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Coelopyrum has small, alternate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces achene fruits that are dispersed by wind. It is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize various environments."
