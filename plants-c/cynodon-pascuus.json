    "intro": "Cynodon pascuus, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and is highly drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid environments. The plant forms dense turf through rhizomes and stolons, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown, and it is widely used for lawns and pastures due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements. Its adaptability has led to its introduction in various parts of the world, including the United States."
