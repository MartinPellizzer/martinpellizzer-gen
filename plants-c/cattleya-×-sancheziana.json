    "intro": "Cattleya \u00d7 sancheziana, commonly known as the S\u00e1ncheziana orchid, is a hybrid orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange, often with contrasting dark veins. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in tropical climates with seasonal dry periods. The orchid is prized for its ornamental value and is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
