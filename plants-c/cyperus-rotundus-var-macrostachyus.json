    "intro": "Cyperus rotundus var. macrostachyus, commonly known as purple flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, spreading rhizomes and narrow, grass-like leaves that often have a reddish or purple tinge. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in wet or moist soils and is often found in marshy areas, along waterways, and in disturbed sites. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a weed in agricultural fields and natural habitats."
