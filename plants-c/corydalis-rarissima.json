    "intro": "Corydalis rarissima, commonly known as the rarest corydalis, is a delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and clusters of small, delicate flowers that range in color from pink to violet. The plant produces unique, spurred petals that are adapted for pollination by specific insects. Due to its extremely limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered one of the rarest and most endangered members of the Fumariaceae family. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this rare botanical species."
