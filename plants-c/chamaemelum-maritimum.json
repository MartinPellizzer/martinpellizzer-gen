    "intro": "Chamaemelum maritimum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found growing on dunes or rocky shores. Its medicinal properties have been historically recognized, though it is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Chamaemelum maritimum is well adapted to maritime conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species."
