    "intro": "Cheilanthes refracta, commonly known as the refract light fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in rocky or crevice habitats, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant has a compact, tufted growth form with finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of hair. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are typically arranged in lines. Cheilanthes refracta is well adapted to survive in harsh environments, making it a resilient and hardy plant species."
