    "intro": "Cyanea longissima, commonly known as the long-stemmed sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the humid, saline conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are broad and lobed, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Cyanea longissima plays an important ecological role in supporting local insect and bird populations."
