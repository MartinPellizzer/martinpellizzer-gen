    "intro": "Calydermos repens, commonly known as the creeping calydermos, is a low-growing perennial plant native to certain regions of South America. It features slender,\u530d\u5310 (creeping) stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its native habitat. Calydermos repens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
