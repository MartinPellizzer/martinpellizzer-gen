    "intro": "Chamaesyce canescens subsp. glabra, commonly known as sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It has a sprawling growth habit with small, narrow, and usually hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its succulent stems and leaves are adapted to store water, enhancing its survival in harsh environments."
