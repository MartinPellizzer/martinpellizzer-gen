    "intro": "Cryptantha dolichophylla, commonly known as the long-leaf cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and mountain slopes. Its leaves are elongated and often have a hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Cryptantha dolichophylla is a perennial species that produces small, capsule-like fruits containing its seeds."
