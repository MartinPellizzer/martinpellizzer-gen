    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. serenyiana, commonly known as the Serenyiana hazelnut, is a rare variant of the common hazel. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring elongated, serrated leaves that distinguish it from typical hazel species. The plant produces small, oval nuts enclosed in a cupule, which is typically hairy and persistent. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or moist soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically valuable species."
