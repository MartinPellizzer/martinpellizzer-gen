    "intro": "Cereus thouarsii, commonly known as the Christmas star cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems and clusters of bright orange or red flowers that bloom during the holiday season. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it produces small, round fruits that contain seeds. Cereus thouarsii is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its striking floral display."
