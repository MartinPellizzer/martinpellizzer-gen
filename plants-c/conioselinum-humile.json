    "intro": "Conioselinum humile, commonly known as the dwarf wormseed, is a low-growing annual herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are minute and wind-dispersed, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. Due to its delicate nature, it is often found in rocky or sandy habitats where it can thrive in poor, well-drained conditions."
