    "intro": "Centaurea nigra subsp. rivularis, commonly known as the river centaury, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along riverbanks and stream sides. The plant features upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces dark violet to black flowers with prominent yellow centers. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological importance. The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust growth and darker flower color compared to the typical form of Centaurea nigra."
