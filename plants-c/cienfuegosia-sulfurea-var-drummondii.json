    "intro": "Cienfuegosia sulfurea var. drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond's yellow cienfuegosia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its pod fruits and often nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that are clustered in racemes, adding a vibrant touch to its habitat. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a resilient species in its native range."
