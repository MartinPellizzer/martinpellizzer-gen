    "intro": "Carduus defloratus subsp. rhaeticus, commonly known as the Alpine thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and a tall, branching stem that bears purple to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It produces small, achene fruits that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across high-altitude habitats. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
