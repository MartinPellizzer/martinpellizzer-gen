    "intro": "Calamagrostis flavens, commonly known as the golden reed, is a perennial grass native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with a yellowish hue. The plant produces panicles of small, golden florets that bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual element to wetland habitats. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. Calamagrostis flavens plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
