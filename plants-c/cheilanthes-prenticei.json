    "intro": "Cheilanthes prenticei, commonly known as the Prentice's rockcap, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in rocky or crevice habitats, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a rhizome that produces a cluster of dense, leathery, ovate to lanceolate fronds. Its spores are released from the sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds. Cheilanthes prenticei is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range."
