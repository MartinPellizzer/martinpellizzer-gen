    "intro": "Cooperia miradorensis, commonly known as the Mirador grass, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Cooperia miradorensis is valued for its resilience and is often used in ecological restoration projects in its native habitat."
