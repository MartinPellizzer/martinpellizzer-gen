    "intro": "Ctenitis crinita var. atrata, commonly known as the black frond fern, is a variant of the Ctenitis crinita species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. This fern is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are often adorned with a distinctive, velvety texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. The variety atrata is distinguished by its darker pigmentation compared to other variants of the species."
