    "intro": "Celaenodendron, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a member of the Malvaceae family. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces fluffy, white spherical flower clusters that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds. Celaenodendron is native to tropical Africa and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
