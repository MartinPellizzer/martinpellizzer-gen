    "intro": "Cassia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate cassia, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough texture with a slightly aromatic scent. Cassia prostrata is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
