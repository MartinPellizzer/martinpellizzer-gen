    "intro": "Cicuta maculata, commonly known as water hemlock, is a toxic herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant contains potent toxic compounds, primarily cicutoxin, which can be lethal to humans and animals if ingested. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils near waterways and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its high toxicity, it is considered one of the most dangerous plants in North America."
