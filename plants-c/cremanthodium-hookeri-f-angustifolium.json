    "intro": "Cremanthodium hookeri f. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cremanthodium, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its slender, elongated stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish to orange flowers arranged in a composite head, which is typical of the daisy family. It is native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
