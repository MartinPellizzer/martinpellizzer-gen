    "intro": "Cynanchum pendulum, commonly known as the hanging milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family, which includes other milkweeds, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its fruit is a follicle containing toxic, sticky seeds. Cynanchum pendulum is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting local insect populations. However, it contains cardiac glycosides, making it potentially poisonous to humans and livestock."
