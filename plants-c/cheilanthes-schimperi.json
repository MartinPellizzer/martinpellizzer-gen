    "intro": "Cheilanthes schimperi, commonly known as the Ethiopian rock fern, is a species of fern that thrives in arid and rocky environments. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, drought-resistant growth habit. The plant has fleshy, leathery fronds that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It is native to regions of Africa, particularly Ethiopia, and is often found growing on exposed rock surfaces. Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered an important indicator species for rocky and semi-arid habitats."
