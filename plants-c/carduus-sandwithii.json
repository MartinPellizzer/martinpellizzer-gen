    "intro": "Carduus sandwithii, commonly known as the Sandwich Island thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and spiny leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and dry habitats, showing adaptations to the island's unique climate. Its leaves are covered in dense, stiff hairs, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The flowers are yellow and bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
