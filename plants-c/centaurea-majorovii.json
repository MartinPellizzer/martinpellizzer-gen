    "intro": "Centaurea majorovii, commonly known as the Balkan bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky and limestone soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features striking blue to purple flower heads, which are surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, tubular flowers, typical of the genus Centaurea. Centaurea majorovii is adapted to harsh environmental conditions and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
