    "intro": "Colchicum exiguum, commonly known as the dwarf autumn crocus, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulb-like structure called a corm. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
