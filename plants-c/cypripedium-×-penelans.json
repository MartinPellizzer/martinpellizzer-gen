    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 penelans, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and exquisite orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, typically in shades of pink, white, or yellow. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural woodland habitat. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, often with a waxy texture, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation and display."
