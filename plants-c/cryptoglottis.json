    "intro": "Cryptoglottis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale greenish-white petals. The plant typically grows on the surface of water or in moist, shaded environments, often without soil. Cryptoglottis has a short, unbranched stem and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
