    "intro": "Calyptranthes aguilarii, commonly known as the Guatemalan mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Central America. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees such as those in the genus Ficus. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually clustered at the tips of the branches. It produces small, white or greenish flowers followed by berries that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host tree if left unchecked."
