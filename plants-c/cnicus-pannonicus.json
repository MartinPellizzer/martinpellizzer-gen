    "intro": "Cnicus pannonicus, commonly known as the Pannonian thistle, is a perennial herb native to Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in dry grasslands, open woodlands, and disturbed soils, exhibiting a robust rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers with ray florets, which bloom in summer, and it is characterized by its prickly, spiny stems. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in harsh environmental conditions. Cnicus pannonicus is also known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in folk remedies."
