It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and elliptical leaves with prominent veins. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, kidney-shaped seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, though it is also threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native environment, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
