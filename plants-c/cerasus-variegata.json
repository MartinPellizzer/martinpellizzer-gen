    "intro": "Cerasus variegata, commonly known as the variegated cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its striking variegated leaves, which often display a mix of green, white, and sometimes pink or yellow. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by edible, sweet cherries in summer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Cerasus variegata is relatively low maintenance but requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth."
