    "intro": "Calamagrostis ramosa, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and silver-tipped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Calamagrostis ramosa is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
