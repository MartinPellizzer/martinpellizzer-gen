    "intro": "Cleistes \u00d7 ochlockoneensis, commonly known as the Ochlockonee cleistostoma, is a hybrid orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, hooded floral structure that encloses the reproductive organs, a trait typical of the cleistogamous flowering strategy. The plant produces small, often fragrant flowers that are pollinated without the need for wind or insects. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in swampy or wetland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
