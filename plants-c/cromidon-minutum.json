    "intro": "Cromidon minutum, commonly known as the small cromidon, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
