The flowers are typically white or pink, with five petals and numerous stamens, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky areas, and is often found in temperate regions of Europe. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in marginal habitats."
