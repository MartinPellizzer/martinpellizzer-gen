    "intro": "Capsella trevirorum, commonly known as the common mouse-ear or mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops like cabbage and mustard. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 cm, with hairy, oval-shaped leaves and small white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, fields, and waste areas. Its seeds are small and dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread easily across different habitats."
