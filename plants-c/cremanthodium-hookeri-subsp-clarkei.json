It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
