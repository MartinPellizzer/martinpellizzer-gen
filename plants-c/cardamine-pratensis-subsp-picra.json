It features trifoliate leaves with a basal rosette and small, bright yellow flowers arranged in a loose raceme. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is characterized by its preference for moist, nutrient-rich soils and its role in supporting local insect populations. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
