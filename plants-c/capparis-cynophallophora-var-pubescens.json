It is characterized by its thorny stems and oval, waxy leaves that are covered in fine, pubescent hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, green berries that mature to a dark purple color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal and rocky environments. The hairy caper is often used in ornamental gardening due to its distinctive appearance and resilience."
