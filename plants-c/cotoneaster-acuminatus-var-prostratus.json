    "intro": "Cotoneaster acuminatus var. prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate cotoneaster, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It features dense, spreading growth habit with small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright red berries that are a source of food for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. Its compact form makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover in shady or semi-shaded areas."
