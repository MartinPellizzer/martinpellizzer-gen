    "intro": "Chrysosplenium lanuginosum var. pilosomarginatum, commonly known as the fuzzyleaf sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features a basal rosette of softly hairy, ovate leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fibrous roots and dense foliage make it an effective ground cover in wetland habitats."
