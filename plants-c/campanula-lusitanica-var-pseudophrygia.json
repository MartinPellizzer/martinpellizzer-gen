    "intro": "Campanula lusitanica var. pseudophrygia, commonly known as the Portuguese bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. It is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. This variety is closely related to other campanula species and is characterized by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
