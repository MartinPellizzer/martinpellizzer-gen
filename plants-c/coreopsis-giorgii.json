    "intro": "Coreopsis giorgii, commonly known as the Mexican coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring slender stems and bright yellow flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are composed of ray florets surrounded by a disk of tubular flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Coreopsis giorgii is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
