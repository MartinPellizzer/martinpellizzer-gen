    "intro": "Carex oligocarpa var. paeninsulae, commonly known as the Peninsula sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of California. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along the edges of tidal marshes and estuaries. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers in the summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species. This variety is distinguished by its slightly smaller leaves and more compact growth form compared to the typical Carex oligocarpa."
