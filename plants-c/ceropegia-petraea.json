It is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems and small, pale green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces delicate, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is well adapted to rocky soils. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
