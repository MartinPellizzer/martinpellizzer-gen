It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many flowering plants known for their ornamental and medicinal uses. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are usually divided into five to seven lobes, and its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal.
