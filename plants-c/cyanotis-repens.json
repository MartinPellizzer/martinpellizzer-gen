    "intro": "Cyanotis repens, commonly known as the creeping bluebell, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often with a white or pale pink throat. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Cyanotis repens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth."
