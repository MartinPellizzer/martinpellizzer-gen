    "intro": "Conioselinum shanii, commonly known as the Shanii wormwood, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant produces small, oval fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts upon maturity. It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family."
