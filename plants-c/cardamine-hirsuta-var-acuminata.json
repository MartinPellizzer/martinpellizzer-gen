    "intro": "Cardamine hirsuta var. acuminata, commonly known as the hairy water-crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soils, often found in streams, ditches, and marshes. The plant features finely divided, feather-like leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots anchor it in the substrate. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and arranged in a dense, club-shaped cluster. The species is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name."
