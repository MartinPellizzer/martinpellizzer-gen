    "intro": "Cyclosorus caudipinna, commonly known as the long-tailed water flea, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that are often found in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with its root system anchoring it to the substrate. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually emerging from the water surface in late summer. Cyclosorus caudipinna plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
