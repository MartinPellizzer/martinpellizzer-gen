    "intro": "Crambe suecia, commonly known as Swedish crambe, is a herbaceous plant native to northern Europe. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and lobed leaves. Its flowers are small, yellow, and borne in racemes, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Crambe suecia is often found in dry meadows and sandy soils, and it has been studied for its potential as a biofuel crop due to its high oil content."
