    "intro": "Cleome glandulosissima, commonly known as the sticky cleome, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in wetlands. Cleome glandulosissima is an annual herb that is relatively easy to grow in gardens with adequate sunlight and water."
