    "intro": "Carpogymnia dryopteris var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a small, terrestrial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. This variant is often found in rocky or sandy soils, making it a resilient species in challenging habitats."
