It is characterized by its slender, upright culms that are often covered with sparse, short spines. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and stream sides. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The few-spined bamboo is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage structure."
