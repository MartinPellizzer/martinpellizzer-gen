It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green with striking red or orange veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
