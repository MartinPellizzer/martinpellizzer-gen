    "intro": "Chamaecrista glandulosa var. brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian ticktrefoil, is a perennial legume native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and pairs of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
