It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its ability to thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
