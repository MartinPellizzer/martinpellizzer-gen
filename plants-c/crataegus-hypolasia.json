    "intro": "Crataegus hypolasia, commonly known as the low-growing hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features thorned stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. Its botanical characteristics include a woody structure, opposite leaf arrangement, and a preference for moist, well-drained soils. Crataegus hypolasia is often found in woodland edges and stream banks, contributing to local biodiversity."
