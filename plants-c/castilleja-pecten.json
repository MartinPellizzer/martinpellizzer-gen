    "intro": "Castilleja pecten, commonly known as the featherleaf paintbrush, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking, feather-like leaves. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats like grasslands and woodland edges. Castilleja pecten is native to the western United States and is considered a sensitive species due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
