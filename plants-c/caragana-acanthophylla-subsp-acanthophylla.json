    "intro": "Caragana acanthophylla subsp. acanthophylla, commonly known as the sandbar buckthorn, is a shrub native to central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in steppe and semi-desert environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used for soil stabilization and as a forage plant."
