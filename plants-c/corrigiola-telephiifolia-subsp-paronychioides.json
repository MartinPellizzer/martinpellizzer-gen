    "intro": "Corrigiola telephiifolia subsp. paronychioides, commonly known as the coastal sandplant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit and produces small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune habitats. This subspecies is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds."
