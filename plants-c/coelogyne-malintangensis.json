    "intro": "Coelogyne malintangensis, commonly known as the Bornean ghost orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its elongated, strap-like leaves and clusters of pale green to white flowers with a distinctive, intricate pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Its flowers are short-lived, typically blooming for only a few weeks during the wet season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
