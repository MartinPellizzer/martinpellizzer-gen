    "intro": "Carex deweyana var. deweyana, commonly known as Dewey's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. It has a clump-forming habit and can reach heights of up to 3 feet. The flowers are usually greenish or brownish, and the plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
