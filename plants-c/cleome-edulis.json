    "intro": "Cleome edulis, commonly known as the \"spider plant,\" is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant produces edible seeds that are often used in traditional cuisines, particularly in parts of Mexico and Central America. Its leaves are also consumed, though they are generally less palatable than the seeds. Cleome edulis thrives in warm, sunny climates and is often grown as an ornamental or for its edible parts."
