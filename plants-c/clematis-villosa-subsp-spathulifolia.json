It features compound leaves with three to five elliptic to ovate leaflets, often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of blue to purple. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners. Its vigorous growth habit requires support, such as trellises or fences, to climb effectively."
