    "intro": "Cuscuta scabrella, commonly known as the rough dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle involving seed dispersal and germination on suitable hosts. The plant's stems are hairy and often curl around the stems of its host, forming a dense network. It is found in various habitats, including grasslands and agricultural fields, where it can cause significant damage to crops. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays an important role in ecological interactions and can be a challenge for agricultural management."
