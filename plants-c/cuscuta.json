    "intro": "Cuscuta, commonly known as dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow or white flowers and has thread-like stems that wrap around its host to form a connection. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize new hosts. Cuscuta can infest a wide range of plants, including crops, causing damage by draining their resources. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, making it a significant concern in agricultural settings."
