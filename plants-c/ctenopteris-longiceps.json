    "intro": "Ctenopteris longiceps, commonly known as the long-leaf sea\u84b2\u516c\u82f1, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green and have a soft, airy texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found near coastal areas or in dense tropical forests. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Ctenopteris longiceps is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
