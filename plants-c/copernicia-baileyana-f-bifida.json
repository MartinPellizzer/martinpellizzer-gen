    "intro": "Copernicia baileyana f. bifida, commonly known as the bifid copernicia, is a rare and distinctive palm species native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its unique bifid (split) leaf bases, which set it apart from other members of the genus. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. Its leaves are long and pinnate, providing a striking visual appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
