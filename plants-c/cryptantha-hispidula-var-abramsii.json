It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically hairy and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
