It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, typical of many members of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or medicinal purposes."
