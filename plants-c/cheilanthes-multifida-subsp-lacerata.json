    "intro": "Cheilanthes multifida subsp. lacerata, commonly known as the fringed rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and rocky habitats in North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky environments."
