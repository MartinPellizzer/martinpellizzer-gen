    "intro": "Clidemia heterobasis, commonly known as the creeping marshplant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest understories. Clidemia heterobasis is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
