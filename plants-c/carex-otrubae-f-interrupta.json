    "intro": "Carex otrubae f. interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are small and clustered, with three stamens and a three-lobed pistil. The subspecies 'interrupta' is distinguished by its interrupted or sparse flowering along the spike, which is a notable botanical feature."
