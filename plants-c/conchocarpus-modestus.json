    "intro": "Conchocarpus modestus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils, it is considered an invasive species in many regions."
