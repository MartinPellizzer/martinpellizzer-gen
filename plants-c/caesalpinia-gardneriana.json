    "intro": "Caesalpinia gardneriana, commonly known as the flame tree, is a striking tropical plant native to Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its vibrant, feathery red flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling flames, hence its common name. The plant has bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small leaflets, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental species in warm climates. The seeds are encased in long, slender pods that split open to release the seeds when mature."
