    "intro": "Cheilanthes keralensis, commonly known as the Keralan rock fern, is a species of fern native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a small, terrestrial fern that thrives in rocky and limestone-rich soils, often found in shaded, humid environments. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a bluish-green hue. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its rocky habitat and its potential ecological significance in the region."
