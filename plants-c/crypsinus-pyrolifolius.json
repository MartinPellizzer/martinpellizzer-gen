    "intro": "Crypsinus pyrolifolius, commonly known as the Pyrola leaf cryptomeria, is a rare flowering plant belonging to the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. Native to the mountainous regions of East Asia, this plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
