    "intro": "Cadetia biloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Crambe, characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent leaves. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Cadetia biloba produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer."
