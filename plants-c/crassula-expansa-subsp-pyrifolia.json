    "intro": "Crassula expansa subsp. pyrifolia, commonly known as the firecracker plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features fleshy, upright stems that are often tinged with red, and its leaves are thick, oval, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, bright red flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Crassula expansa subsp. pyrifolia is popular as a houseplant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
