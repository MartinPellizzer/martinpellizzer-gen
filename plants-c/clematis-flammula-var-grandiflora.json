It features small, fragrant, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. This variety is valued for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
