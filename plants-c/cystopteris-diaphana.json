    "intro": "Cystopteris diaphana, commonly known as the translucent water clover, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of China, India, and the Philippines. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its fronds are typically light green and have a translucent appearance, especially when viewed from above. The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid, tropical climates."
