    "intro": "Chrysosplenium oppositifolium, commonly known as the opposite-leaved chrysosplenium, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Saxifragaceae family. It is characterized by its opposite arrangement of lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinct veining pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
