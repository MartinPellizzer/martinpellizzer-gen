    "intro": "Campanula longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, supporting clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The leaves are typically lanceolate and arranged alternately along the stem, while the flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Campanula longipes is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its striking floral display."
