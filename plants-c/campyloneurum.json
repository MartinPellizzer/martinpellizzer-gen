    "intro": "Campyloneurum, commonly known as the water hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in wetland and marshy environments. They are characterized by their showy, often colorful flowers that can resemble those of hibiscus species. The leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, and the plants thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Campyloneurum species are often used in ornamental horticulture due to their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various aquatic conditions."
