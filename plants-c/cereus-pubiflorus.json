    "intro": "Cereus pubiflorus, commonly known as the hairy-flowered cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and clusters of white, tubular flowers that bloom at night. The plant has spiny areoles and is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming make it a striking addition to desert gardens."
