    "intro": "Cheilanthes myriophylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its robust, evergreen fronds that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This fern is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in harsh environments."
