    "intro": "Crassula fruticosa, commonly known as the rock fig, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers during the summer months. It is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in sandy soils. Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate drought make it a popular choice for rock gardens."
