    "intro": "Cibotium cumingii var. arachnoideum, commonly known as the spider's web tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, lace-like appearance due to their finely divided segments. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
