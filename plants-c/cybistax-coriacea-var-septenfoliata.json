It is characterized by its low, spreading growth habit and pale green, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. This species is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
