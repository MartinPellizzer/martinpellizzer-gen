    "intro": "Cerastium pumilum subsp. litigiosum, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers throughout the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cool, temperate climates."
