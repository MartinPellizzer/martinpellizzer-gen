    "intro": "Cyclosorus oblancifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved cyclosorus, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves that are broad at the base and taper towards the tip. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
