    "intro": "Cactus mammillaris var. lanuginosus, commonly known as the woolly mammillaria, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, rounded stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that provide insulation and protection from intense sunlight. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for succulent collections."
