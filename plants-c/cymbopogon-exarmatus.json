    "intro": "Cymbopogon exarmatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf lemon grass, is a perennial grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a strong, aromatic scent due to the presence of essential oils. The plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments and is often found in wetlands or along water bodies. Its flowering spikes are usually inconspicuous, and the plant is valued for its medicinal and aromatic properties. Cymbopogon exarmatus is closely related to other members of the grass family, such as lemongrass, and is used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
