    "intro": "Carpinus tschonoskii var. brevicalycina, commonly known as the dwarf calycine hornbeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in catkins, which are typically borne in clusters. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a tendency to develop shallow fissures as the plant matures. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
