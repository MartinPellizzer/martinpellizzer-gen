    "intro": "Corydalis parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered Corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, creeping stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The flowers are typically pink or purple and bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in well-drained soil."
