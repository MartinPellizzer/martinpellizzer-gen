    "intro": "Cyclosorus hokouensis, commonly known as the Hokou water fern, is a rare aquatic fern species native to China. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
