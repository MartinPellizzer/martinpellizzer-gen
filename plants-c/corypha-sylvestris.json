    "intro": "Corypha sylvestris, commonly known as the wild cycad, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones developing on separate plants. It is a slow-growing species that can live for several decades, and its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered vulnerable in some regions."
