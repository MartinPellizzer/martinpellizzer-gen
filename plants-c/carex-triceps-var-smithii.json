    "intro": "Carex triceps var. smithii, commonly known as Smith's three-bracted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and wet meadows. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is distinguished by its unique bract morphology, which gives it its common name."
