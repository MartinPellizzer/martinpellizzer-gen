    "intro": "Callitriche polymorpha f. ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous water starwort, is a rare aquatic plant species belonging to the Hydrocharitaceae family. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically oval or rounded in shape. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are usually submerged or floating on the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its morphological variability, including differences in leaf shape and flowering patterns, contributes to its common name and ecological adaptability."
