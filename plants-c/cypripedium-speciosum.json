    "intro": "Cypripedium speciosum, commonly known as the showy lady's slipper, is a striking orchid native to the temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its large, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper, which is a unique feature among orchids. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and meadows. Its flowers are usually pink or white with a contrasting greenish throat, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Cypripedium speciosum is a perennial herb that has a long, fleshy rhizome and is often found in clusters."
