    "intro": "Cristaria humilis, commonly known as the dwarf starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with small, delicate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
