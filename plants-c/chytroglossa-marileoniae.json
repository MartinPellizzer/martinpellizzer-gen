    "intro": "Chytroglossa marileoniae, commonly known as the Marileonia orchid, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, fragrant blooms that display a complex array of colors. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its leaves are broad and sword-shaped, often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited habitat and specific ecological requirements, Chytroglossa marileoniae is considered a vulnerable species."
