    "intro": "Crataegus laevigata, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red berries known as haws, which are edible but often used in jams and wines. Crataegus laevigata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also noted for its ecological importance as a food source for birds and insects."
