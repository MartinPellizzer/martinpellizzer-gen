    "intro": "Cleome tenuifolia, commonly known as spider flower, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cleome tenuifolia is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun. Its rapid growth and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, decorative plant."
