    "intro": "Cyperus cundudoensis, commonly known as the Cunduvense flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to South America, particularly found in Brazil. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its slender, triangular stems are often adorned with small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer. Cyperus cundudoensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native ecosystem."
