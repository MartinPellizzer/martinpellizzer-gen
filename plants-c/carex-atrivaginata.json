    "intro": "Carex atrivaginata, commonly known as black sheath sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, leaf sheaths that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wet to moist habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in a terminal inflorescence. Carex atrivaginata is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
