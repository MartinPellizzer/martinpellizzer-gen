    "intro": "Carex brizoides var. stricta, commonly known as stiff sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its narrow, upright leaves are generally dark green and form a compact rosette. The flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in early summer, and the plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
