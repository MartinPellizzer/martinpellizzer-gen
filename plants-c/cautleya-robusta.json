    "intro": "Cautleya robusta, commonly known as the giant flame orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 cm in length, with bright red and orange hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial orchid, often found in humid, shaded forest environments. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients, while its roots are adapted for anchoring in tree bark or soil. Cautleya robusta blooms during the rainy season, making it a notable species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
