    "intro": "Cactus tetrancistrus, commonly known as the Mexican jumping bean, is a unique plant belonging to the Cactaceae family. It is native to the deserts of Mexico and is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water for survival in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fruit that contains seeds. Unlike typical cacti, it does not have spines but instead has a fuzzy, woolly covering that helps reduce water loss. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
