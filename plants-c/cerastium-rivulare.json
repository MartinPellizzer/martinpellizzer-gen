    "intro": "Cerastium rivulare, commonly known as the water chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically features small, hairy, succulent leaves and white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. Its stems are often prostrate, allowing it to spread along the ground. Cerastium rivulare is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet habitats."
