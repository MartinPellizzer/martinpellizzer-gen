    "intro": "Cousinia radians, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cold, dry conditions. The plant features showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cousinia radians is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
