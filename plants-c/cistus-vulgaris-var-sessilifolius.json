    "intro": "Cistus vulgaris var. sessilifolius, commonly known as the sessile-leaved rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its greyish-green, woody stems and small, evergreen leaves that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional herbal medicine."
