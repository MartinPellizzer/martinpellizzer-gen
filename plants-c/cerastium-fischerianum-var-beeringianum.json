It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, hairy, oval leaves and produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its botanical structure supports its role as a pioneer species in tundra ecosystems."
