    "intro": "Carduus polyacanthos, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its striking purple to violet flower heads, which are surrounded by bracts that form a distinctive cone-like structure. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and features deeply lobed, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for native gardens and pollinator habitats."
