    "intro": "Callitriche brevistyla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, often in muddy or sandy substrates. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape. Its flowers are tiny, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences near the water surface. Callitriche brevistyla plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and contributing to water quality through its dense growth."
