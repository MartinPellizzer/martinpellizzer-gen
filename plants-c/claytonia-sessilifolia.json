    "intro": "Claytonia sessilifolia, commonly known as the pink rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, basal leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Claytonia sessilifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
