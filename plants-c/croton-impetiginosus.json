    "intro": "Croton impetiginosus, commonly known as the blistering croton, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, spiny capsules containing seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic sap, it is important to handle the plant with care."
