    "intro": "Cistus symphytifolius var. vaginatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
