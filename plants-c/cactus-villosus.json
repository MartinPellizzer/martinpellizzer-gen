    "intro": "Cactus villosus, commonly known as the hairy cactus, is a species native to arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its roots are shallow and adapted to absorb moisture quickly from infrequent rains. Cactus villosus is often used in traditional medicine and is a popular ornamental plant in dry climates."
