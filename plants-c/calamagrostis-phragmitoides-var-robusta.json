It is characterized by its stiff, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces panicles of small, fluffy flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in hue. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and wetlands, and is often found in riparian zones. Its structure and growth pattern make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
