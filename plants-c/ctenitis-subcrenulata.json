    "intro": "Ctenitis subcrenulata, commonly known as the ctenitis fern, is a species of true fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a wavy or curled margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, which help anchor it in the soil. The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters, making it a distinctive and ornamental plant in tropical gardens."
