    "intro": "Cajanus hirtopilosus, commonly known as the hairy hairy globemallow, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in spikes, typically blooming in spring. It is adapted to low-nutrient soils and can thrive in conditions with limited rainfall. Cajanus hirtopilosus is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
