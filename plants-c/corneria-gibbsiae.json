    "intro": "Corneria gibbsiae, commonly known as the Gibbs' corneria, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun exposure. Its foliage is usually narrow and grass-like, with small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Corneria gibbsiae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
