It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its unique, elongated fronds with a distinctive, curled shape. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions. Its spores are dispersed through wind, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
