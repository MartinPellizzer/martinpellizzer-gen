    "intro": "Cuscuta major var. varia, commonly known as the giant dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. The plant is native to North America and can be found growing on a variety of host species, including shrubs and trees. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to spread widely. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unchecked."
