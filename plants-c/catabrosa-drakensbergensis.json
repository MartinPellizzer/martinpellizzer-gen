    "intro": "Catabrosa drakensbergensis, commonly known as the Drakensberg catabrosa, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Drakensberg mountain range in South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and is known for its striking purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in areas with high altitudes and cool, moist climates. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in open grasslands or on slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
