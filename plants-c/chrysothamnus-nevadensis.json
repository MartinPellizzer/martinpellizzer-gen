    "intro": "Chrysothamnus nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada goldenbush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, golden-yellow foliage and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as rocky slopes and dry plains. Its leaves are generally narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense inflorescences, attracting various pollinators."
