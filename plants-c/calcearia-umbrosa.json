    "intro": "Calcearia umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, pale yellow or white flowers that resemble small, delicate orchids. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing in the undergrowth of dense forests. Its leaves are typically broad and glossy, adapted to capture limited sunlight. Calcearia umbrosa is also notable for its short lifespan, with some species blooming only once before dying."
