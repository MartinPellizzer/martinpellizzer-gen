It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are often submerged or floating on the surface of water. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in early spring. It typically grows in wetlands, ponds, and slow-moving streams, preferring moist and nutrient-rich soils. This fern-like plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates."
