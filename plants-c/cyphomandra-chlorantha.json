    "intro": "Cyphomandra chlorantha, commonly known as the yellow nightshade, is a flowering plant in the Solanaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its yellow flowers and edible berries. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The berries, which are yellow when ripe, are used in some traditional cuisines but should be consumed with caution due to the presence of toxic compounds."
