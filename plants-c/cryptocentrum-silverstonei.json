    "intro": "Cryptocentrum silverstonei, commonly known as the silverstone orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near streams or in forest understories. Its flowers are usually pale green to white with intricate patterns, and it has a unique symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern."
