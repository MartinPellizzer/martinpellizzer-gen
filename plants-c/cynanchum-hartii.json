    "intro": "Cynanchum hartii, commonly known as Hart's dogbane, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores. Its roots are fibrous and can spread underground, allowing it to form dense colonies in moist, wooded areas. Cynanchum hartii is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
