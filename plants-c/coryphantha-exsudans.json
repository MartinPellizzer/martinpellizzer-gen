    "intro": "Coryphantha exsudans, commonly known as the weeping cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that exude a milky sap when broken, which is a common trait among plants in the Cactaceae family. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green, ribbed structure. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant adapted to arid environments. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
