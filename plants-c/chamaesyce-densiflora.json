It is a low-growing perennial herb with a mat-forming habit, characterized by its dense, woolly foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to arid environments. Its botanical features make it a hardy and resilient plant suitable for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
