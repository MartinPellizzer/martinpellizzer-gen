    "intro": "Cnestis emarginata, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves that are often lobed or notched, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, round, yellowish fruits. It is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
