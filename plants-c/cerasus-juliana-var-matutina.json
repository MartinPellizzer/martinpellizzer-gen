    "intro": "Cerasus juliana var. matutina, commonly known as the Japanese early cherry or matutina cherry, is a compact, ornamental shrub native to Japan. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom very early in the spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has a rounded form with dense, dark green foliage that provides a striking contrast to its delicate blossoms. It is prized for its early flowering habit and is often used in gardens for its ornamental value. The flowers are typically followed by small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans."
