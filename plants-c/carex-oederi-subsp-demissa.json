    "intro": "Carex oederi subsp. demissa, commonly known as the slender sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread vegetatively. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
