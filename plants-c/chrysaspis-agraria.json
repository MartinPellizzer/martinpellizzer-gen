    "intro": "Chrysaspis agraria, commonly known as the golden leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow leaves and small, fragrant orchid flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in high humidity and requires indirect sunlight to prevent leaf scorching. Its unique botanical features make it a sought-after specimen among horticultural enthusiasts. Due to habitat destruction, it is now classified as endangered and is protected in many regions."
