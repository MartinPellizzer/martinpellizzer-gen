    "intro": "Cryptogramma japonica, commonly known as Japanese cryptogramma, is a small, evergreen fern native to Japan and parts of East Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and have a smooth, glossy texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a characteristic feature of ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Cryptogramma japonica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cool, humid conditions."
