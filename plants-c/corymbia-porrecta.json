    "intro": "Corymbia porrecta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed apple, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to the tropical and subtropical regions of northern Australia, particularly in Queensland and the Northern Territory. The plant is a small to medium-sized tree, typically reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with smooth, greyish bark that peels in strips. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a glossy green upper surface and a pale underside. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, yellowish-red fruits that are similar in appearance to apples."
