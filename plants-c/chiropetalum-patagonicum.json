    "intro": "Chiropetalum patagonicum, commonly known as the Patagonian orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andes of southern South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil. Its roots are often specialized for nutrient absorption in nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
