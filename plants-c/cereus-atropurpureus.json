    "intro": "Cereus atropurpureus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water efficiently. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale pink. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. Cereus atropurpureus is popular as a houseplant due to its striking appearance and unique flowering habit."
