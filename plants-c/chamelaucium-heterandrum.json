    "intro": "Chamelaucium heterandrum, commonly known as the coastal bottlebrush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from red to pink, which bloom during the warmer months. The plant has a compact, rounded growth habit with dense foliage that helps it withstand coastal conditions. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in saline environments. Chamelaucium heterandrum is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
