    "intro": "Coincya monensis var. setigera, commonly known as the hairy water starwort, is a aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, contributing to water clarity by reducing algae growth. This variant is distinguished by its more robust and hairy foliage compared to the typical form of Coincya monensis."
