    "intro": "Cydonia lobata, commonly known as the rough-hairy quince, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and broad, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces fragrant, pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by yellow-orange fruits that ripen in late summer. The fruit has a tough, leathery skin and a sweet, aromatic pulp when mature. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of edible fruit in its native habitat."
