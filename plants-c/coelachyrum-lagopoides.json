    "intro": "Coelachyrum lagopoides, commonly known as the silverleaf goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has alternate, succulent leaves that are usually coated with a waxy, silvery layer, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white and appear in clusters. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
