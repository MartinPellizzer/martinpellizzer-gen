It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in shaded to partly shaded environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
