    "intro": "Caiophora scandens, commonly known as the climbing caiophora, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves that are usually a deep green. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in rainforests or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth habit, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
