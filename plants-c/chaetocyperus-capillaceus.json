    "intro": "Chaetocyperus capillaceus, commonly known as the slender bulbous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks."
