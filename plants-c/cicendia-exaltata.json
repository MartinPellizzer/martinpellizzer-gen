    "intro": "Cicendia exaltata, commonly known as the tall sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows up to 1 meter in height, with slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Cicendia exaltata plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and provides nectar for pollinators."
