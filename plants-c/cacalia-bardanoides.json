    "intro": "Cacalia bardanoides, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads made up of many small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in dry, harsh environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss. The flowers are typically pale blue or purple and bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
