    "intro": "Colchicum hexapetalum, commonly known as the six-petaled autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It features striking purple to violet flowers with six petals, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous corm, typical of the Colchicaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is cultivated in gardens and has historical use in traditional medicine."
