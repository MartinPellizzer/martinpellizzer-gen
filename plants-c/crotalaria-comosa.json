    "intro": "Crotalaria comosa, commonly known as the woolly crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive, spiny pod, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Crotalaria comosa is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though it can be toxic to livestock."
