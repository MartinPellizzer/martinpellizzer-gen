    "intro": "Claoxylon rostratum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed claoxylon, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and elongated, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often found in lowland rainforests. Claoxylon rostratum is valued for its timber and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
