    "intro": "Cladocolea pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's cliffbracken, is a rare fern native to the rocky coastal regions of New Zealand. It thrives in harsh, wind-swept environments, often growing on limestone or sandstone cliffs. The plant has leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive, rugged texture. Its spores are released in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
