    "intro": "Cotyliphyllum mucizonia, commonly known as the mucilaginous cotyliphyllum, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its gelatinous, mucilage-rich structures. It thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving or still waters with soft substrates. The plant's morphology includes a central stem with specialized leaf-like structures that aid in nutrient absorption. Its mucilaginous coating helps in water retention and provides a protective barrier against herbivores. This species plays a role in stabilizing sediment and supporting microfauna in its habitat."
