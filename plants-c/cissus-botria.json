    "intro": "Cissus botria, commonly known as the climbing cissus, is a vine native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, white dots. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its stems are succulent and can trail or climb, making it suitable for hanging baskets or trellises. Cissus botria thrives in bright, indirect light and is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular houseplant."
