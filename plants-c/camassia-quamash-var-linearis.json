It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Its leaves are narrow and linear, distinguishing it from other camas varieties. It plays an important ecological role in supporting pollinators and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
