    "intro": "Cyrtandra orbicularis, commonly known as the orbicular cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its orbicular-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially sunbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure. Cyrtandra orbicularis is also valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
