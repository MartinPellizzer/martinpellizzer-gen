    "intro": "Calathea lancifolia, commonly known as the swordleaf calathea, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often adorned with intricate patterns of contrasting colors. The plant belongs to the Marantaceae family and is prized for its ornamental value in indoor gardening. Its foliage exhibits a unique phenomenon called \"nyctinasty,\" where the leaves fold shut at night. Calathea lancifolia thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent humidity and well-draining soil to flourish."
