    "intro": "Clidemia diversifolia, commonly known as the tropical milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bright orange to red flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in disturbed habitats. Clidemia diversifolia is also known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it both a valuable ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some regions."
