    "intro": "Crataegus scabrida var. improvisa, commonly known as the rough-fruited hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate to elliptic leaves with serrated edges, and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The fruit is a red to orange-red drupe that matures in the fall, often persisting into winter. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open woods, thickets, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a valuable species for ecological restoration."
