    "intro": "Comarum digitatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has pinnately divided leaves that are often described as having a finger-like appearance, hence its scientific name. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Comarum digitatum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
