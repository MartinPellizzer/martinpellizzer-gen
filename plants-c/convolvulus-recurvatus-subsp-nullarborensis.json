    "intro": "Convolvulus recurvatus subsp. nullarborensis, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is a herbaceous annual that produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant has hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes or inland deserts. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
