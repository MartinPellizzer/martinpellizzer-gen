    "intro": "Cliffortia ilicifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on coastal cliffs and slopes. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
