    "intro": "Clusia venulosa, commonly known as the waxleaf clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by orange or red berries. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of light conditions. Clusia venulosa is also valued for its air-purifying properties and its use in traditional medicine."
