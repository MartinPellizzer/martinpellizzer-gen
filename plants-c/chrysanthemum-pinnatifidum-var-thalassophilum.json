    "intro": "Chrysanthemum pinnatifidum var. thalassophilum, commonly known as the sea chrysanthemum, is a coastal plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that are adapted to tolerate salt spray and sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow to white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, maritime climates and is often found growing along shorelines and in coastal gardens. Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered an important species for ecological studies in coastal ecosystems."
