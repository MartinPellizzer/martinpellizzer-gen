    "intro": "Cirsium tuberosum proles bulbosum, commonly known as the bulbous thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy roots that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces spiny, purple flower heads that are surrounded by broad, lobed leaves. Its growth habit is typically clump-forming, with multiple stems emerging from a central root system. The species is often found in dry meadows, rocky soils, and disturbed areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
