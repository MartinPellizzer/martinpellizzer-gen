    "intro": "Croton micans var. pubescens, commonly known as the velvet croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety foliage with deep green, velvety leaves that have a distinctive waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens with suitable climatic conditions."
