    "intro": "Chrysothamnus nauseosus subsp. texensis, commonly known as Texas tansy, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
