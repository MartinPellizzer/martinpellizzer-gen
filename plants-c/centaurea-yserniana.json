    "intro": "Centaurea yserniana, commonly known as the Ysern's cornflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments."
