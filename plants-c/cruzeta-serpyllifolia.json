    "intro": "Cruzeta serpyllifolia, commonly known as common sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, fleshy, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Cruzeta serpyllifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
