    "intro": "Capsicum laurifolium, commonly known as the laurelleaf chili, is a species of nightshade plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that resemble those of the laurel tree, hence its common name. The plant produces small, elongated fruits that range in color from green to red, depending on maturity. These fruits are typically used in culinary applications for their mild to medium heat level. Botanically, it is distinguished by its hairy stems and clusters of small white flowers that bloom in the summer months."
