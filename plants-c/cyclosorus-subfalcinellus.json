    "intro": "Cyclosorus subfalcinellus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water clover, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is a small, aquatic plant characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of water quality."
