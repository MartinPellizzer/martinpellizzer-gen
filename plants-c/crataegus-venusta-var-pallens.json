    "intro": "Crataegus venusta var. pallens, commonly known as the white-flowered hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, white flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and the bark is typically smooth with a grayish-white color. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive floral display and seasonal interest."
