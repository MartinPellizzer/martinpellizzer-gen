    "intro": "Ceropegia racemosa subsp. setifera, commonly known as the woolly ceropegia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
