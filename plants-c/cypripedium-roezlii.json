    "intro": "Cypripedium roezlii, commonly known as the R\u00f6sel's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-shaped lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its botanical features include a tall, erect stem with broad, leathery leaves. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cypripedium roezlii is classified as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
