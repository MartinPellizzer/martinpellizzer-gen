    "intro": "Capsella hians, commonly known as the common mouse-ear or mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, hairy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces tiny white flowers with four petals, which bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal make it a common weed in many regions."
