    "intro": "Cirsium \u00d7 celakovskyanum, commonly known as the Celakovskyan thistle, is a hybrid plant species native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, purple to pinkish flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant produces rough, lobed leaves with a silvery underside, and its flowers are typically surrounded by bracts that form a distinctive, thistle-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
