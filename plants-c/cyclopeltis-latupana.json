It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes plants such as hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its stems are woody and can grow quite long, allowing it to climb and spread across vegetation. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
