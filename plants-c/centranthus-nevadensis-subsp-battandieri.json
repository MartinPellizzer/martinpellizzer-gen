It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important component of local flora and a subject of ecological study."
