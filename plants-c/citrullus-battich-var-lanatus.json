    "intro": "Citrullus battich var. lanatus, commonly known as the hairy bitter gourd, is a tropical vine native to South and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender fruits covered in fine, white, hair-like pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers and has a rapid growth habit, often climbing supports as it matures. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a slightly serrated margin, and the fruit is typically green when unripe, turning orange-red when mature. This variety is valued for its bitter taste and is commonly used in traditional Asian cuisines."
