    "intro": "Cocos romanzoffanopulposa, commonly known as the Romanzoff's coconut, is a rare and enigmatic plant species belonging to the Arecaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery palmate leaves. The plant produces distinctive, spiny fruits that contain a single, large seed. It is native to a very limited geographic region in the Andes, where it thrives in high-altitude, humid environments. Due to its restricted habitat and low population numbers, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
