    "intro": "Carduus peisonis, commonly known as the Italian thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a robust, spiny stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with deeply lobed, silvery-green leaves covered in dense, prickly hairs. The plant produces purple to violet flower heads, which are composed of numerous tiny florets arranged in a spherical shape. Its leaves and stems are covered in stiff, bristly hairs that serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Carduus peisonis is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as roadsides, wastelands, and rocky areas."
