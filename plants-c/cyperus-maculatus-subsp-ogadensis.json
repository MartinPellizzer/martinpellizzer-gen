It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered spikelets. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as swamps and seasonal pools. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Its flowers are usually unisexual, with separate male and female inflorescences, a common feature in the Cyperaceae family."
