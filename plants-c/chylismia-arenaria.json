    "intro": "Chylismia arenaria, commonly known as the sand dune lily, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and delicate, pale yellow or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dune environments where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh, dry climates. Chylismia arenaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in coastal ecosystems."
