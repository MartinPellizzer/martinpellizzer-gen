    "intro": "Coptis quinquefolia var. trifoliolata, commonly known as the three-leaved goldthread, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and its yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant contains berberine, a potent alkaloid with medicinal properties. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
