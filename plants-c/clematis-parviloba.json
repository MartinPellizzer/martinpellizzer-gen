It features slender, twining stems that can grow up to 15 feet in length, making it suitable for trellises or arbors. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is heart-shaped and provides attractive foliage throughout the growing season. Clematis parviloba prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, though it can tolerate some shade."
