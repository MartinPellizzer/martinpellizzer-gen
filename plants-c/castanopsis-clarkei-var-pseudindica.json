    "intro": "Castanopsis clarkei var. pseudindica, commonly known as the Indian chestnut or hill teak, is a deciduous evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its hard, durable wood. The plant produces small, cupule-enclosed nuts that are dispersed by animals, contributing to its ecological significance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests at elevations between 600 and 1,500 meters. Its botanical features make it an important species for both timber and ecological restoration."
