    "intro": "Carpha costularioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, clustered flower heads that are typically brown or greenish in color, typical of sedges. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. Carpha costularioides is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils."
