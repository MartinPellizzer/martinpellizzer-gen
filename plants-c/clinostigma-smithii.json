    "intro": "Clinostigma smithii, commonly known as the Smith's clinostigma, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
