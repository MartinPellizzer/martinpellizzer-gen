    "intro": "[WRONG START] Cephalophyllum parvibracteumat, commonly known as the narrow-bract cephalophyllum, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cactaceae family. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit with short, ribbed stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are reduced to spines, typical of many cacti. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
