    "intro": "Ceratochaete aquatica, commonly known as the water spikerush, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and shallow waters. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a distinct spiky inflorescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets. It thrives in nutrient-rich, calm waters and plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems. Ceratochaete aquatica is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and provide habitat for aquatic life."
