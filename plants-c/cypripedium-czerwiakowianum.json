    "intro": "Cypripedium czerwiakowianum, commonly known as the Czerwiakowianum\u6753\u5170, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive pinkish-brown coloration and a prominent lip. The plant typically grows in cool, moist habitats such as forests and meadows, where it thrives in partial shade. Its roots are tuberous, and it produces a single stem with a few broad, lance-shaped leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
