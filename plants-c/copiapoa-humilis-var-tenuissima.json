    "intro": "Copiapoa humilis var. tenuissima, commonly known as the slender copiapoa, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is a small, columnar cactus with a short, rounded stem and dense, white to pale green spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically clustered at the apex of the stem. It is adapted to thrive in arid conditions with minimal rainfall and high sunlight exposure. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and protected species."
