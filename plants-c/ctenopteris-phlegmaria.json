    "intro": "Ctenopteris phlegmaria, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a unique reproductive system, with sporangia clustered in dense, spore-producing clusters called sori on the underside of its fronds. Its fronds are often described as having a leathery texture and a distinctive, almost metallic sheen. Ctenopteris phlegmaria thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
