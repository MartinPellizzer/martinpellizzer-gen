    "intro": "Celosia patentiloba, commonly known as the flame flower or croton, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant, spiky bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with smooth, glossy green foliage. It thrives in warm, sunny conditions and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Celosia patentiloba is often cultivated for its striking appearance and ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
