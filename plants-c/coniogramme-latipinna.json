    "intro": "Coniogramme latipinna, commonly known as the broad-lobed fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that are typically divided into broad, lobed segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along stream banks and in woodland areas. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. The fronds are typically evergreen, providing year-round interest in the landscape."
