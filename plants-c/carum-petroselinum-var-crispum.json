    "intro": "Carum petroselinum var. crispum, commonly known as curly parsley, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that are curled and crisp, giving it a distinct appearance. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in umbels, which are typical of the Apiaceae (carrot) family. Curly parsley is often used as a culinary herb, adding a fresh, peppery flavor to dishes. It thrives in cool climates and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and herb collections."
