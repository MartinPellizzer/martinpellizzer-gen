    "intro": "Carex duvaliana, commonly known as Duval's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes many other sedges and related plants. Carex duvaliana is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
