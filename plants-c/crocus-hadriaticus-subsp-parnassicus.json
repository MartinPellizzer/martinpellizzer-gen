    "intro": "Crocus hadriaticus subsp. parnassicus, commonly known as the Parnassian crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the alpine regions of the Balkans and the Carpathian Mountains. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color, with a distinctive dark central blotch. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its bulbs are often covered in a thin, fibrous coating that helps protect them during winter dormancy. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
