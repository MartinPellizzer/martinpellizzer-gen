    "intro": "Cakile maritima var. americana, commonly known as American sea rocket, is a coastal plant native to the Atlantic coast of North America. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy, saline soils along shorelines. The plant features alternate, pinnately compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets, and it produces clusters of yellow flowers in early spring. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species in harsh coastal environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its successful colonization of coastal areas."
