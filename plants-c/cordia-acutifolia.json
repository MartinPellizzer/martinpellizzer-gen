    "intro": "Cordia acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaved cordia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves with acute tips and smooth, often glaucous upper surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, spherical capsules that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and riverine habitats. Cordia acutifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some regions for medicinal purposes."
