    "intro": "Claytonia brevifolia, commonly known as the dwarf spring beauty, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features rosettes of fleshy, oval leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its woodland habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, usually blooming in early spring. Its succulent leaves and short stature make it well adapted to moist, shaded environments. Claytonia brevifolia is often found in rich, moist soils along stream banks and in forest understories."
