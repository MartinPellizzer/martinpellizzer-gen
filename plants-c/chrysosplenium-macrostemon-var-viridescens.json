    "intro": "Chrysosplenium macrostemon var. viridescens, commonly known as the green-leafed stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It features dense clusters of small, bright green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale yellow, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its foliage and flowering habits make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in cool, humid climates."
