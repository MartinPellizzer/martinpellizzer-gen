It features fleshy, often hairy leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale green, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insects. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rockeries and container gardening."
