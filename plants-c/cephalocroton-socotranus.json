    "intro": "Cephalocroton socotranus, commonly known as Socotra cypress, is a unique plant endemic to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like crown and spiral arrangement of branches. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces yellow flowers that develop into woody, cone-like structures. It thrives in the arid and semi-arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered vulnerable to extinction."
