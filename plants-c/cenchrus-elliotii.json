    "intro": "Cenchrus elliotii, commonly known as Elliot's grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its drought tolerance and adaptability make it a common component of native plant communities in its range."
