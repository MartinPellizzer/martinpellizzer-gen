    "intro": "Cleome dolichocarpa, commonly known as the tall cleome, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 2 to 3 meters in height, featuring erect stems and large, lobed leaves. The plant produces clusters of showy, yellowish-white flowers with five petals, which bloom from summer to fall. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Cleome dolichocarpa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
