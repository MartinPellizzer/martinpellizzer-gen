    "intro": "Chazaliella abrupta var. parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf chazalina, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pale blue or violet, blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a desirable addition to drought-tolerant gardens."
