    "intro": "Cereus macrostibas var. roseiflorus, commonly known as the rose-flowered torch cactus, is a striking member of the Cactaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height, often adorned with sparse, spiny areoles. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming at night, which is a common trait among many cacti. Its nocturnal flowering habit is an adaptation to attract specific pollinators such as moths. This variety is valued in horticulture for its dramatic appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
