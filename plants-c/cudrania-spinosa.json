    "intro": "Cudrania spinosa, commonly known as the spiny cudrania, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Cudrania spinosa is adapted to survive in harsh climates and is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
