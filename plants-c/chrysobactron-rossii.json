It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, yellowish to golden flowers. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Chrysobactron rossii is often found in chaparral and woodland areas, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
