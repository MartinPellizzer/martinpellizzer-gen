    "intro": "Clematis anethifolia, commonly known as the anise-leaved clematis, is a perennial vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, anise-scented leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Clematis anethifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to climb trellises or fences."
