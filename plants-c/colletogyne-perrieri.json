    "intro": "Colletogyne perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils and is often found in shrubland and grassland habitats. Colletogyne perrieri plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies."
