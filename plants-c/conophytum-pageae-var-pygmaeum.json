It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water to survive. Its compact size and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections."
