    "intro": "Cousinia raddeana, commonly known as the red sand mat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a low-growing perennial herb with dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is adapted to survive in sandy soils, allowing it to thrive in areas with limited water. Cousinia raddeana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
