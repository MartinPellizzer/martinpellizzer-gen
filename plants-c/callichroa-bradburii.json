    "intro": "Callichroa bradburii, commonly known as the Bradburry's glorybower, is a striking member of the Bignoniaceae family native to the arid regions of southern Africa. This shrub or small tree is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of yellow and orange. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving them a soft appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
