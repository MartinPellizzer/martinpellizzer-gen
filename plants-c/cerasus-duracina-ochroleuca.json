    "intro": "Cerasus duracina ochroleuca, commonly known as the white-flowered cherry, is a species of shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are oval-shaped with a smooth surface and a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
