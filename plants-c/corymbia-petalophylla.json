    "intro": "Corymbia petalophylla, commonly known as the red gum or red blood gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are clustered in umbels, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of native Australian ecosystems."
