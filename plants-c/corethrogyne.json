    "intro": "Corethrogyne, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. They typically grow in moist, well-drained soils and are often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Corethrogyne species are perennial herbs that produce small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Their botanical features make them valuable for both ecological and ornamental purposes in gardens and natural landscapes."
