    "intro": "Cycnoches egertonianum, commonly known as the Egerton's cycnoches, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer, featuring a unique combination of colors and intricate patterns. The plant grows in rocky or forested habitats, often in areas with high humidity and cool temperatures. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, which is crucial for its survival in its native environment. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cycnoches egertonianum is considered a vulnerable species."
