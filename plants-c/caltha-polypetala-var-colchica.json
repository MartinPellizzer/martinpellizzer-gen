It features striking yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming habit and delicate appearance."
