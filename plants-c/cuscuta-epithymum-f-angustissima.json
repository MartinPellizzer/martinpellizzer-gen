    "intro": "Cuscuta epithymum f. angustissima, commonly known as the narrowleaf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can be invasive in certain environments. The species is characterized by its reduced leaves and specialized structures for attachment to hosts."
