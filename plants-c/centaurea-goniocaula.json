    "intro": "Centaurea goniocaula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved centaury, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Centaurea goniocaula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soils."
