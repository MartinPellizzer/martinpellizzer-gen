    "intro": "Citrus inodora, commonly known as the West Indian lime or Mexican lime, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It produces small, round, green fruits that are typically harvested when they are still unripe and contain a high concentration of citric acid. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves and is often cultivated for its aromatic foliage and edible fruit. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The fruit is widely used in culinary applications and for making beverages due to its tart flavor."
