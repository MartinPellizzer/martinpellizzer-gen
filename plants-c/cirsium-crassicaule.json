    "intro": "Cirsium crassicaule, commonly known as the thick-stemmed thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its robust, often hairy stems and large, spiny leaves that form a basal rosette. The plant produces purple to pink flowers in late summer, which are typically clustered in a spherical inflorescence. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with prominent serrated edges, and the plant is known for its prickly texture. Cirsium crassicaule is often found in grasslands, wastelands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates."
