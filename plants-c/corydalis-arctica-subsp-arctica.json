    "intro": "Corydalis arctica subsp. arctica, commonly known as the Arctic Corydalis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically grows in rocky and gravelly soils, often in alpine or tundra environments. The plant features slender stems and small, delicate flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its low-growing habit. Corydalis arctica subsp. arctica is adapted to cold climates and has a short growing season, blooming in late spring or early summer."
