    "intro": "Cowiea borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean cowiea, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Borneo. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within lowland rainforests. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy bracts that enhance its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss, Cowiea borneensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
