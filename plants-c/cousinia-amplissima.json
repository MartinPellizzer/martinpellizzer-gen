    "intro": "Cousinia amplissima, commonly known as the giant cousine, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Cousinia amplissima is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native range."
