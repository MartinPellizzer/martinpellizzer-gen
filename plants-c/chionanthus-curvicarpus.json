    "intro": "Chionanthus curvicarpus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf chionanthus, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late spring, often in clusters along the branches. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, providing a delicate appearance against the white blooms. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically dispersed by birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
