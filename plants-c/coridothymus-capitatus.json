It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry habitats. The plant produces small, pink or violet flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is aromatic, with a scent reminiscent of thyme, and it is often used in herbal remedies. The species is well adapted to arid conditions, making it a resilient plant in harsh environments."
