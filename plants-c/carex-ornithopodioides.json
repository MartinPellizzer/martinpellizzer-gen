    "intro": "Carex ornithopodioides, commonly known as the bird's-foot carex, is a perennial sedge native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. The plant features a dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, grass-green leaves that are often clustered at the base. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, brownish flowers. Carex ornithopodioides plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
