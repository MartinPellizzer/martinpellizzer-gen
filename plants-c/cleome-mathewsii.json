    "intro": "Cleome mathewsii, commonly known as the desert spiderflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that resemble spider webs, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Cleome mathewsii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-nutrient soils."
