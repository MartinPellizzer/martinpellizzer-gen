    "intro": "Callicarpa loboapiculata, commonly known as the red beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces striking clusters of bright red berries in the fall, which are a key feature for identification. These berries are not only ornamental but also serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. Callicarpa loboapiculata thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often cultivated for its vibrant seasonal display."
