    "intro": "Convallaria amplexifolia, commonly known as lily of the valley, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to woodland areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a toxic red berry-like structure called an aril, which contains the poisonous seeds. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and toxic properties, it is both admired and carefully handled in horticulture."
