    "intro": "Ctenitis fijiensis, commonly known as the Fiji ctenophyll, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of the South Pacific, particularly Fiji. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, providing structural support and aiding in nutrient absorption. The fronds are typically evergreen, with a distinctive, segmented appearance that contributes to its ornamental value."
