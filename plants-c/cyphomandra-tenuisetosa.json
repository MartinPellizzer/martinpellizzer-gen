    "intro": "Cyphomandra tenuisetosa, commonly known as the slenderleaf nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. The plant features slender, hairy stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and a slightly hairy texture. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns red when mature, though it is generally not cultivated for consumption due to its bitter taste."
