    "intro": "Cyrtochilum parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique, helmet-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces small, fragrant blooms that are adapted to attract specific pollinators such as bees and wasps. Cyrtochilum parviflorum thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical significance lies in its role within the diverse orchid flora of the Neotropics."
