    "intro": "Ceraia facifera, commonly known as the yellow stinkhorn, is a unique fungal plant that belongs to the Phallaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow, fleshy cap that emits a strong, unpleasant odor to attract flies for spore dispersal. The fruiting body develops from a basal stem called a volva, which is often covered in a slimy, sticky substance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found decomposing organic matter in forest floors. Due to its foul smell and unusual appearance, it is both fascinating and somewhat repulsive to observers."
