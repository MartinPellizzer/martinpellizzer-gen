    "intro": "Chrysothamnus ceruminosus, commonly known as the yellow rabbitbrush, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, resinous leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. The species is adapted to drought and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
