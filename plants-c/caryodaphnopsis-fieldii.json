    "intro": "Caryodaphnopsis fieldii, commonly known as the field's caryodaphnopsis, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the family Pinaceae, which includes coniferous trees and shrubs, though it is not a true conifer. The plant is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring small, scale-like leaves and a distinctive cone structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in association with other rare flora in its limited habitat. Due to its restricted range and ecological specificity, Caryodaphnopsis fieldii is considered a sensitive indicator of ecosystem health."
