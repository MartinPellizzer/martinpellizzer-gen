It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant has been used historically in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
