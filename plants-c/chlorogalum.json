    "intro": "Chlorogalum, commonly known as the candleplant, is a genus of flowering plants native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant produces yellow or white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Chlorogalum species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value. The name \"candleplant\" refers to the candle-like shape of its flower stalk."
