    "intro": "Crinitaria tatarica, commonly known as the Tatarian horned lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its unique thallus structure, which is typically crustose and forms a thin, tightly adherent layer on rock surfaces. The lichen contains a mix of algae and fungi, with the fungal component providing protection and the algal component contributing to photosynthesis. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found on tree bark or stone in temperate regions. Crinitaria tatarica is notable for its ability to tolerate environmental stress and is sometimes used as an indicator species in ecological studies."
