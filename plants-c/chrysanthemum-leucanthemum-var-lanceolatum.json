    "intro": "Chrysanthemum leucanthemum var. lanceolatum, commonly known as the slender white marguerite, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are finely toothed and arranged alternately along the stem. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for garden borders and rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
