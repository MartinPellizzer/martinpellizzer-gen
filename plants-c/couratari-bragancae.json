    "intro": "Couratari bragancae, commonly known as the Brazilian wax tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lecythidaceae. It is native to the Amazon rainforest and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in humid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by large, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of the rainforest ecosystem. Couratari bragancae is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in traditional crafts and construction."
