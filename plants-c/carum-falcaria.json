    "intro": "Carum falcaria, commonly known as the broadleaf caraway, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like parsley and dill. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in umbels. Its seeds are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to caraway. Carum falcaria thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
