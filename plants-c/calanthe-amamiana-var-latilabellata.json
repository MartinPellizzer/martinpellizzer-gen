    "intro": "Calanthe amamiana var. latilabellata, commonly known as the Amami orchid, is a species native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with a distinctive lip that is broader than the other petals. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
