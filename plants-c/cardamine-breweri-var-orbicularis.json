    "intro": "Cardamine breweri var. orbicularis, commonly known as the orbicular watercress, is a rare and delicate member of the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are often submerged in wet, rocky habitats. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments such as stream banks and mountainous regions. Its flowers are white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
