It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are opposite and lanceolate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss.
