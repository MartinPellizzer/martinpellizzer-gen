    "intro": "Cinchona pitayensis var. trianae, commonly known as the Triana's quina, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by oval, red berries. It is valued for its bark, which contains alkaloids such as quinine, historically used in the treatment of malaria. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
