    "intro": "Crepidium bracteosum, commonly known as the bracteate orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, elongated leaf. The plant produces a spike of small, greenish-white flowers with a distinct three-lobed lip. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
