    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated hazel, is a variant of the common hazel that exhibits distinctive foliage patterns. Its leaves are characterized by a striking combination of green, white, and yellow, creating a visually appealing contrast. The plant is native to Europe and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. It produces small, edible nuts similar to those of the common hazel, though they are less commonly harvested for food. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade."
