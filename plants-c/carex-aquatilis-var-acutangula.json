    "intro": "Carex aquatilis var. acutangula, commonly known as the sharp-pointed water sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and slightly pointed at the tips. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
