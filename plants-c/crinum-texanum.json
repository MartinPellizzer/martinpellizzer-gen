    "intro": "Crinum texanum, commonly known as the Texas lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its strap-like, grass-like leaves and produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, or pink. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its bulbous root system allows it to store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in varying environmental conditions. Crinum texanum is often found in wetlands, prairies, and along riverbanks, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
