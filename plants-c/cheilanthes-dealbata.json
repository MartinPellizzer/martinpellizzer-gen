    "intro": "Cheilanthes dealbata, commonly known as the silver fringe fern, is a perennial fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, grayish-white fronds that have a distinctive fringed appearance along the edges. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. It has a compact growth habit and produces small, yellowish spore-bearing structures on the underside of its leaves. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a drought-tolerant landscape plant."
