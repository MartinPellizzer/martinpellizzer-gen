    "intro": "Cantleya corniculata, commonly known as the horned bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a flowering period in late summer. Cantleya corniculata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists."
