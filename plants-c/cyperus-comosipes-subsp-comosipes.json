    "intro": "Cyperus comosipes subsp. comosipes, commonly known as the tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, cylindrical inflorescences that are often adorned with white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, such as marshes, swamps, and along water edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats."
