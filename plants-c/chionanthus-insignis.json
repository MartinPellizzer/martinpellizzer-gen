    "intro": "Chionanthus insignis, commonly known as the Chinese lantern tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its showy, white or pale yellow flowers that resemble lanterns, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. It produces small, round, red or orange berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. Chionanthus insignis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance in suitable climates."
