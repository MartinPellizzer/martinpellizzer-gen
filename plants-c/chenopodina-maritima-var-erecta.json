    "intro": "Chenopodina maritima var. erecta, commonly known as sea blite, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and succulent, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other areas with high soil salinity. Its ability to tolerate extreme conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
