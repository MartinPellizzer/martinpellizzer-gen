    "intro": "Candollea schizantha, commonly known as the \"spiny leaf orchid,\" is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, thriving in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a spiny texture, which helps in reducing water loss in its arid surroundings. Candollea schizantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
