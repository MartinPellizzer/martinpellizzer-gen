    "intro": "Caelestina isocarphoides, commonly known as the sky-blue bellflower, is a strikingly beautiful plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range from pale blue to deep violet, often with a white throat. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to reflect excess sunlight. Caelestina isocarphoides is a perennial herb that blooms in late summer, adding a touch of elegance to its natural habitat."
