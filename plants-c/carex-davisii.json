    "intro": "Carex davisii, commonly known as Davis' sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and Georgia, and thrives in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps. The plant has slender, triangular stems and produces small, clustered flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. Carex davisii plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species in its native environment."
