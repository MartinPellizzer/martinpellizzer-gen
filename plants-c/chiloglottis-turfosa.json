    "intro": "Chiloglottis turfosa, commonly known as the Turf Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing foliage and is often found in heathlands and open forests. The plant produces small, greenish-brown flowers that are typically arranged in a spike, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions. Its botanical significance lies in its ecological role and its value in conservation efforts."
