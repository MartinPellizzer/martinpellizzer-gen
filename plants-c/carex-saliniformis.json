    "intro": "Carex saliniformis, commonly known as salt marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically green to bluish-gray in color. This plant thrives in saline and brackish wetlands, often found in marshes and tidal areas. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of small, three-stamened flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Carex saliniformis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
