    "intro": "Coriflora viticaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved coralflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and clusters of small, coral-colored flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged flowering period and drought tolerance. However, it is not commonly cultivated due to its specific habitat requirements and limited availability in horticultural markets."
