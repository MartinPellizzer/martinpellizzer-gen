It features small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has smooth, glabrous stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other clematis species. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate flowers and compact growth habit."
