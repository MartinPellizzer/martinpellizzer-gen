    "intro": "Ctenopteris fragillima, commonly known as the brittle sea kale, is a species of sea holly native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in its saline environment. The plant typically grows in shallow tidal zones, where it tolerates both salt spray and periodic submersion. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by spore-bearing cones, which are typical of the cycadophytes group. Ctenopteris fragillima plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small marine and terrestrial organisms."
