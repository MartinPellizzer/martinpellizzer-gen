    "intro": "Crucianella fimbriata, commonly known as the fringe-flowered sea bean, is a small, perennial shrub native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, woody stems and small, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bean-like pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in coastal restoration projects to stabilize sand dunes."
