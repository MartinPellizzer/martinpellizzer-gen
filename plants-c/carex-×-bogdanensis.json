    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 bogdanensis, commonly known as the Bogdanov's sedge, is a hybrid plant in the Carex genus, native to the wetlands of eastern Europe and parts of Russia. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spike-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in marshy or boggy habitats. Its leaves are generally narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The inflorescence consists of multiple spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers."
