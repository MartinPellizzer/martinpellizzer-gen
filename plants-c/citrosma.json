It is native to Southeast Asia and includes several species, such as Citrosma congesta and Citrosma macrophylla. These plants are characterized by their aromatic leaves and small, yellowish or greenish flowers. The fruits are typically small and resemble citrus fruits, though they are not true citrus. Citrosma species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded environments."
