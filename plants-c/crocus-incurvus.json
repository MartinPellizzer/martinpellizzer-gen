    "intro": "Crocus incurvus, commonly known as the bent crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 cm, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and a cluster of nodding, bell-shaped flowers. The flowers are usually pale yellow to orange, with a distinctive, curved shape that gives the plant its common name. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and prefers well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in garden settings."
