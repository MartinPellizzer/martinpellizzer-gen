    "intro": "Chrysophyllum marginatum var. tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly starfruit, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, tomentose leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces edible, star-shaped fruits that are similar to those of the common starfruit but are often smaller and have a more intense flavor. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its fruit. The species is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
