    "intro": "Cnidium wolffii, commonly known as Wolff's cnidium, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts when mature. Its leaves are typically pinnately lobed, and the plant often grows in dry, rocky soils. Cnidium wolffii is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
