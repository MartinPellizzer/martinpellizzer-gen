    "intro": "Convolvulus orizabensis, commonly known as the Mexican morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a perennial vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing along fences or in rocky areas. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed. Convolvulus orizabensis is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, enhancing soil fertility."
