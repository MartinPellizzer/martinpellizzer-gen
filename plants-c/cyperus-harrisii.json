    "intro": "Cyperus harrisii, commonly known as the Harris' flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedge plants, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as swamps and seasonally flooded areas. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in dense clusters, and it produces three-sided, boat-shaped fruits. Cyperus harrisii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
