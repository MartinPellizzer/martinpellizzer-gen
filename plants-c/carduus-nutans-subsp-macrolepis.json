    "intro": "Carduus nutans subsp. macrolepis, commonly known as the largeleaf sagewort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, spoon-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its subspecies distinction is based on differences in leaf size and morphology compared to other Carduus species."
