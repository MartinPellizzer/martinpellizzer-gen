    "intro": "Carex vulpina f. nemorosa, commonly known as the woodland sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
