    "intro": "Cereus viridiflorus var. minor, commonly known as the green-flowered cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a small, compact cactus with a cylindrical stem that often branches at the base. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers during the night, which is a characteristic feature of many nocturnal blooming cacti. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. The plant is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative specimen in succulent gardens."
