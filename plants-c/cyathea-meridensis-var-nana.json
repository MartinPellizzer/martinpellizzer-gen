    "intro": "Cyathea meridensis var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf tree fern, is a compact variety of the tree fern genus Cyathea. It is characterized by its short, sturdy trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. Native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Its fronds are bioluminescent under certain conditions, adding an unusual visual effect. The plant is often cultivated as an ornamental species due to its elegant appearance and slow growth rate."
