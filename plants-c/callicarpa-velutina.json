    "intro": "Callicarpa velutina, commonly known as the velvet beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces vibrant purple to red berries in the fall, which are a key feature for both ornamental and ecological purposes. These berries are rich in antioxidants and are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Callicarpa velutina thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
