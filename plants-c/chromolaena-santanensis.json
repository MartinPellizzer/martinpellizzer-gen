    "intro": "Chromolaena santanensis, commonly known as the stinging leaf or false chuchuma, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaves. The plant is known for its hairy, often stinging leaves that can cause irritation upon contact with skin. It thrives in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings, often forming dense thickets. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means make it an invasive species in some areas."
