    "intro": "Cephalorhizum setiferum, commonly known as the woolly root orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern and eastern Europe. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy roots and its small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. It is notable for its unique morphology, with its hairy roots giving it a woolly appearance, and it is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
