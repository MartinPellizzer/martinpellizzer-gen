    "intro": "Cyperus globulosus var. pseudofiliculmis, commonly known as the globular flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its compact, rounded inflorescence that resembles a globe. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters. This variant is distinguished by its unique inflorescence structure, which sets it apart from other members of the Cyperus genus."
