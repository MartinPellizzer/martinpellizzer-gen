    "intro": "Comesperma rhadinocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and cylindrical, woody fruits that remain on the plant for extended periods. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a leathery texture, and the plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native wildlife."
