    "intro": "Carduus ambiguus, commonly known as the common cocklebur, is a flowering plant in the daisy family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and large, yellow-orange flower heads that contain both ray and disk flowers. The plant produces rough, spherical fruits that are covered in hooked bracts, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa but has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Carduus ambiguus is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
