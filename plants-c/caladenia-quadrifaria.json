    "intro": "Caladenia quadrifaria, commonly known as the Four-leafed Spider-orchid, is an orchid species native to the eastern regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and striking, spider-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces four leaf-like structures, which are actually modified leaves called phyllodes, giving it its common name. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open forests or heathlands. Caladenia quadrifaria is a protected species due to habitat loss and is often listed as vulnerable in several states."
