It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its pleasant, sweet scent."
