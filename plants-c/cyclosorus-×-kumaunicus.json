    "intro": "Cyclosorus \u00d7 kumaunicus, commonly known as the Kumaon water fern, is a hybrid species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into small, rounded lobes. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions of the Himalayas. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. Cyclosorus \u00d7 kumaunicus plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms in its native habitat."
