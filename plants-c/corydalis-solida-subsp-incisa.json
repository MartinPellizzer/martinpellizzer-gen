    "intro": "Corydalis solida subsp. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Corydalis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, branching stems that often grow to a height of about 30 centimeters. The leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctively narrow, pointed tip, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, with two upper petals that are larger than the lower ones, forming a distinctive spurred shape. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its delicate foliage and vibrant, early spring blooms."
