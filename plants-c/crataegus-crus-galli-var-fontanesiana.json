    "intro": "Crataegus crus-galli var. fontanesiana, commonly known as the Italian hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters and features thorny branches with opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and rocky areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
