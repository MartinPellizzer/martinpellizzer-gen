It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a robust rhizome system that helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive forked appearance at the base. Cyathea furcata plays an important ecological role in tropical forests by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
