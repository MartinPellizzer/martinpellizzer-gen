    "intro": "Cereus adscendens, commonly known as the ascending cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its stems are covered in sharp spines and have a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Cereus adscendens is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
