    "intro": "Ceanothus divergens subsp. confusus, commonly known as the Sierra ceanothus, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in chaparral and woodland habitats, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a silvery or grayish underside, contributing to its drought tolerance. This subspecies plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife."
