    "intro": "Ctenitis jinfoshanensis, commonly known as the Jinfoshan holly fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a unique, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, humus-filled soil. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
