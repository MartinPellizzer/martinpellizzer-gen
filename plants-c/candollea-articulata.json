    "intro": "Candollea articulata, commonly known as the articulated fern, is a species of aquatic fern found in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its segmented, creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread along the substrate. The plant produces small, spirally arranged leaves with a distinctive, articulated structure that gives it its common name. Its fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. Candollea articulata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
