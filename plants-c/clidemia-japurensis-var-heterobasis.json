    "intro": "Clidemia japurensis var. heterobasis, commonly known as the yellow-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its small, opposite, ovate leaves with a pubescent surface. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in cymes, attracting various pollinators. Its roots form haustoria to parasitize the roots of host trees, allowing it to absorb water and nutrients. This species is often found in moist, shaded understories of tropical forests."
