    "intro": "Cypripedium gratrixianum, commonly known as the Gratrix's lady's tresses, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring, typically in shades of pink and white. The plant features a tall, slender stem with a single spike of small, spirally arranged flowers, which gives it its common name. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
