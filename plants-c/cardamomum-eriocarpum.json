    "intro": "Cardamomum eriocarpum, commonly known as the woolly-fruited cardamom, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by capsule fruits that are hairy and spherical. Its aromatic seeds are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, though it is less commonly cultivated than other cardamom species. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
