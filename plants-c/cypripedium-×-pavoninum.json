    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 pavoninum, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid that exhibits a blend of characteristics from its parent species, Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium pubescens. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. The plant produces large, showy flowers with a distinctive pink or red pouch-like lip, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. Its leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped, and it has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in rocky or forest soils. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and protected areas."
