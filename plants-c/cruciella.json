It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plants are characterized by their showy, often pink or red flowers that bloom in clusters. Their leaves are typically palmately lobed, and the fruits are capsules that release seeds when mature. Cruciella species are often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
