    "intro": "Cleome procumbens var. arenaria, commonly known as sand cleome, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to arid and sandy environments. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or sandy plains. Its resilience to drought and salt makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
