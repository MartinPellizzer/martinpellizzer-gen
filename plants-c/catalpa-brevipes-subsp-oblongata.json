    "intro": "Catalpa brevipes subsp. oblongata, commonly known as the narrowleaf catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, heart-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical Catalpa brevipes. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by long, slender seed pods. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age. This subspecies is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
