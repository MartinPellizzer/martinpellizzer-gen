    "intro": "Cynorkis kassneriana, commonly known as the Kassner's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Madagascar and parts of the Congo. This plant is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its slow growth and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
