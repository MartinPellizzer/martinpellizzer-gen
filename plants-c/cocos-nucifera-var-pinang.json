    "intro": "Cocos nucifera var. pinang, commonly known as the pinang palm, is a variant of the coconut palm native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender trunk and elongated leaves, which give it a distinct appearance compared to the typical coconut palm. The fruit of this variety is smaller and has a thicker husk, often used in traditional crafts and as a source of edible coconut water. It thrives in tropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in local ecosystems."
