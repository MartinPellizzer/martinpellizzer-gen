    "intro": "Cereus longispinus, commonly known as the long-spined cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its tall, spiny stems and ability to store water in its thick, fleshy tissue. The plant produces large, white, night-blooming flowers that attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its spines are long and sharp, providing protection against herbivores and reducing water loss through transpiration. Cereus longispinus is well adapted to harsh desert environments, making it a resilient and hardy plant."
