    "intro": "Cerastium vulgatum subsp. macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-fruited mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features prostrate or ascending stems that are covered in fine, hairy hairs. The leaves are spoon-shaped, with a hairy surface and a pointed tip, and the flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels. The subspecies is distinguished by its larger, more robust fruits compared to other members of the species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
