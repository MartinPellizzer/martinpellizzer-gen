    "intro": "Crepidium maboroense, commonly known as the Maboro orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, small flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale purple. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss."
