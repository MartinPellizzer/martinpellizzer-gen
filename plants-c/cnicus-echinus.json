It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features rough, spiny stems and leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its yellow flowers bloom in summer, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes. Cnicus echinus is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
