    "intro": "Castilleja miniata subsp. dixonii, commonly known as the Dixon's Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright orange to red bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on host plants for water and nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its blooming period occurs from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
