    "intro": "Carex buxbaumii var. claviformis, commonly known as the Buxbaum's sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Central America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest floors or stream banks. It produces distinctive, club-shaped inflorescences that give it its specific epithet *claviformis*, meaning \"club-shaped.\" This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
