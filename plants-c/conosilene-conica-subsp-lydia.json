    "intro": "Conosilene conica subsp. lydia, commonly known as the Lydia's conical conosilene, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique conical inflorescence, which consists of tightly packed, tubular flowers that resemble a cone. The plant exhibits a herbaceous growth habit with slender, branching stems that often grow in dense clusters. Its flowers are typically pale green to white in color, and they emit a faint, sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, this subspecies is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
