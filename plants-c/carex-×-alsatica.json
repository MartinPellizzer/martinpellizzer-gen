    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 alsatica, commonly known as the common sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its triangular, grass-like stems and is often found in moist or wetland environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in suitable habitats. Carex \u00d7 alsatica is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
