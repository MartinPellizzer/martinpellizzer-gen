    "intro": "Cypripedium hookerae, commonly known as the Hooker's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-shaped lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, thriving in cool and humid conditions. Its flowers are usually pink to reddish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
