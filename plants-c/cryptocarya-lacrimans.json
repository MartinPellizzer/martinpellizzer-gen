    "intro": "Cryptocarya lacrimans, commonly known as the weeping cryptocarya, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its elliptical, glossy, dark green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds. Cryptocarya lacrimans is often found in coastal and dry sclerophyll forests, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
