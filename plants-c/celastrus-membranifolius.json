    "intro": "Celastrus membranifolius, commonly known as the paper-leaf bindweed, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, oval to elliptic leaves that are often thinly membranous, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found along stream banks and in shaded forest understories. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
