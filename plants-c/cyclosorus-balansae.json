    "intro": "Cyclosorus balansae, commonly known as the Balansae water fern, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its floating leaves, which are typically four-lobed and resemble a small wheel, giving it its scientific name. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration. Cyclosorus balansae is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it prefers warm, sunny conditions."
