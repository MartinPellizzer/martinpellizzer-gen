    "intro": "Castilleja ewanii, commonly known as the Ewan's paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, red to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on its host plants for nutrients, often growing on or near grasses and shrubs. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the roots of host plants to extract water and minerals. Castilleja ewanii plays an important ecological role in its habitat, supporting pollinators and contributing to the diversity of plant communities."
