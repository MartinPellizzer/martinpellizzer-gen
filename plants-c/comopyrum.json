    "intro": "Comopyrum, commonly known as the common sedge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae. These plants are typically found in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Comopyrum species are characterized by their triangular stems, which are often hairy, and their spike-like inflorescences. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually wind-pollinated. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
