    "intro": "Cheiranthus lacerifolius, commonly known as the ragged leaf mustard, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, lobed leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to the Mediterranean region, this plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. The plant's name reflects its distinctive, frayed leaf margins, which give it a rugged appearance. It is typically an annual or biennial species, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters."
