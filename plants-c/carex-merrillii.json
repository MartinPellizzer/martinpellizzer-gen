    "intro": "Carex merrillii, commonly known as the Merrill's sedge, is a perennial plant native to eastern Asia, particularly China and Japan. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands, where it thrives in well-drained soil. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it produces distinctive, three-sided seed capsules. Carex merrillii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
