    "intro": "Crepidomanes striatum, commonly known as the striped sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils. The species is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and is often found in disturbed or barren landscapes."
