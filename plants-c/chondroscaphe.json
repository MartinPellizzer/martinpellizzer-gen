    "intro": "Chondroscaphe, commonly known as the false holly or rock holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It typically features small, green, fleshy fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts upon maturity. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and often grows in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are usually finely divided and resemble those of other members of the carrot family. Chondroscaphe species are native to regions in Europe, Asia, and Africa, and they are often found in dry, calcareous environments."
