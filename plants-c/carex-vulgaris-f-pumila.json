    "intro": "Carex vulgaris f. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf marsh sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. The plant typically forms dense mats and thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
