    "intro": "Cyperus nortonii, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, thriving in moist soils and humid climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinct central vein, and it produces small, three-sided spikelets that are often clustered at the tips of its stems. Cyperus nortonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
