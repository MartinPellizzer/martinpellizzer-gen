    "intro": "Cranichis engelii, commonly known as the Engel's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
