    "intro": "Ceratophyllum demersum var. demersum, commonly known as hornwort, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments across the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth pattern and its lack of true roots, instead relying on rhizomes for anchorage. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are usually arranged in whorls around the stems. It produces tiny, green flowers that are typically found in clusters, and it is an important species in aquatic ecosystems for oxygen production and habitat provision. Ceratophyllum demersum var. demersum is also widely used in ponds and water gardens for its aesthetic value and water purification capabilities."
