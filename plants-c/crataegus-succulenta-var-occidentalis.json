    "intro": "Crataegus succulenta var. occidentalis, commonly known as the western hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its thick, succulent leaves that store water, an adaptation to its often arid habitat. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland ecosystems. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local fauna."
