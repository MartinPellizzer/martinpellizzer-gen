    "intro": "Cirsium diabolicum, commonly known as the devil's thorn, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and dark purple to black bracts. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its tough, thorny structure, it is considered a challenging plant to handle and is often avoided by herbivores."
