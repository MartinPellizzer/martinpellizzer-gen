    "intro": "Carduus rheginus, commonly known as the common thistle. It is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which contribute to its prickly texture. The flowers are arranged in a composite head, with both ray and disc florets, and the plant produces achenes as its seeds."
