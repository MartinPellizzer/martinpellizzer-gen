    "intro": "Carex ruffa, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with a distinctive purple hue on the inflorescence. Native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and Asia, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Carex ruffa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
