It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, providing a compact and hardy appearance. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soil and full sun to partial shade. Cassiope nana is often used in alpine gardens for its ornamental value and ability to withstand cold climates."
