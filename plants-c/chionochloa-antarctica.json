    "intro": "Chionochloa antarctica, commonly known as Antarctic hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the cold environments of Antarctica and sub-Antarctic regions. It thrives in nutrient-poor, wind-swept soils and is adapted to extreme cold and intense sunlight. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against desiccation. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its harsh environment. Due to its resilience, it is considered an indicator species of cold, dry ecosystems."
