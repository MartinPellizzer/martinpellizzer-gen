    "intro": "Carex integra, commonly known as the smooth sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, cylindrical leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Carex integra is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
