    "intro": "Cynorkis coccinelloides, commonly known as the red-eyed orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with a distinctive red eye-like marking. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The flowers bloom in clusters, often in shades of yellow and orange, with the red center serving as a visual cue for pollinators."
