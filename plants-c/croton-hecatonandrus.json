    "intro": "Croton hecatonandrus, commonly known as the thousand-leaved croton, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, giving it a dramatic and ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique foliage, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
