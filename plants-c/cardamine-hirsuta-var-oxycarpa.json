    "intro": "Cardamine hirsuta var. oxycarpa, commonly known as the hairy watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, temperate regions. It features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stems. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats."
