    "intro": "Cerastium amurense, commonly known as the Siberian mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has rounded, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges. Cerastium amurense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in garden settings for its hardy, compact growth habit."
