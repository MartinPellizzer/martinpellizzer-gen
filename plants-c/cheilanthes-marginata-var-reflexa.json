    "intro": "Cheilanthes marginata var. reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed cliffbrake, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in rocky, arid environments, typically found in crevices or on limestone outcrops. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This variant is distinguished by its reflexed (bent backward) leaflets, which give it its specific epithet."
