It features striking blue-violet to white flowers that are typically borne on slender, leafless stems. The leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. The plant is notable for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a useful groundcover and a potential weed in certain environments."
