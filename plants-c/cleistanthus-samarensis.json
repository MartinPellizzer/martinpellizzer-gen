    "intro": "Cleistanthus samarensis, commonly known as the Samarensis cleistanthus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. The plant has smooth, lance-shaped leaves and produces capsules as its fruit, which contain numerous seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
