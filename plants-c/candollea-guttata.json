    "intro": "Candollea guttata, commonly known as the spotted spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, thick leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are marked with distinctive red or purple spots, giving it a striking appearance. Candollea guttata is well adapted to dry conditions and is often grown as an ornamental plant in gardens."
