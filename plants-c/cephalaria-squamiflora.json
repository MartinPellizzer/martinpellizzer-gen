    "intro": "Cephalaria squamiflora, commonly known as the woolly cephalaria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in alpine environments. Its fibrous roots and upright stems make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
