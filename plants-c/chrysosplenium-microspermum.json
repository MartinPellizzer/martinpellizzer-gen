    "intro": "Chrysosplenium microspermum, commonly known as the small-seeded chrysosplenium, is a flowering plant belonging to the Saxifragaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, often hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its unique seed structure, with minute seeds enclosed in a fleshy, berry-like capsule, is a notable botanical feature."
