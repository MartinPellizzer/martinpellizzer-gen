    "intro": "Clermontia epilosa, commonly known as the silverleaf clermontia, is a rare and endemic plant found primarily in the Hawaiian Islands. It is a flowering plant belonging to the Gesneriaceae family, characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Clermontia epilosa is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
