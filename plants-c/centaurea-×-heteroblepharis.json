    "intro": "Centaurea \u00d7 heteroblepharis, commonly known as the hybrid Guinea grass, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its bushy growth habit and vibrant blue to purple flower heads, which consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant produces small, bracts that are often mistaken for leaves, and its stems are typically covered in fine, hairy structures. Native to regions of southern Europe and North Africa, it thrives in dry, sunny environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
