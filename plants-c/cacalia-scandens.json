    "intro": "Cacalia scandens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, climbing stems that often trail along the ground or climb over other vegetation. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and slightly hairy, contributing to its rugged appearance. Cacalia scandens thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often found in moist, wooded areas."
