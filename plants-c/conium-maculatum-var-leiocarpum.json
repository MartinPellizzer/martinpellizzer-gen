    "intro": "Conium maculatum var. leiocarpum, commonly known as poison hemlock, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white, umbrella-shaped flowers. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, particularly coniine, which can be lethal to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in fields. Due to its high toxicity, it is considered a noxious weed and requires careful handling."
