    "intro": "Cotoneaster minimus, commonly known as the dwarf cotoneaster, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a slightly glossy surface. It produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. Cotoneaster minimus is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions."
