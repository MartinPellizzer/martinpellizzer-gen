    "intro": "Casuarina dielsiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved she-oak, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance reminiscent of a pine tree. The plant produces small, spherical woody cones that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry forests. Casuarina dielsiana is valued for its hardy nature and is used in landscaping and for erosion control."
