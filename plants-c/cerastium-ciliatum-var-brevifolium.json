    "intro": "Cerastium ciliatum var. brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves with ciliate margins, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a desirable plant for rock gardens and woodland settings."
