    "intro": "Corydalis trachycarpa, commonly known as the rough-seeded corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, nodding flowers that range in color from pink to violet. The plant typically grows in rocky or woodland habitats and has slender, hairy stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, which contributes to its common name. Corydalis trachycarpa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
