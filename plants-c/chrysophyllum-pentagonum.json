    "intro": "Chrysophyllum pentagonum, commonly known as the five-angled star apple, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often five-lobed, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, round fruits with a sweet, aromatic pulp. It is valued not only for its ornamental qualities but also for its fruit, which is consumed fresh or used in culinary applications."
