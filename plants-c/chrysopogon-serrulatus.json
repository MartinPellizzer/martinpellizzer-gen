    "intro": "Chrysopogon serrulatus, commonly known as the serrated grass or narrowleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to various parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wetlands, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with serrated edges, giving it its common name. Its flowering inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered in dense, cylindrical arrangements. Chrysopogon serrulatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
