It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has heart-shaped, lanceolate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable environments."
