    "intro": "Campanula mairei f. cordatifolia, commonly known as the heart-shaped bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are distinctive for their broad, heart-shaped lobes, which give the plant its cultivar name. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
