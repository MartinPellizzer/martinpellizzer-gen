    "intro": "Cleistanthus pubens, commonly known as the hairy cleistanthus, is a deciduous shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine pubescence. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
