    "intro": "Cupania spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf cupania, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often broad and ovate. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in inflorescences, which are typically surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Cupania spathulata is often found in moist, tropical or subtropical environments, growing in dense thickets or along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
