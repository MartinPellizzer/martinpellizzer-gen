    "intro": "Chamaecyparis obtusa f. alba-spica, commonly known as the white-flowered Japanese cypress, is a variant of the Japanese cedar characterized by its unique white or pale blue foliage. It is a slow-growing evergreen conifer that typically reaches heights of 6 to 10 meters. The foliage consists of scale-like leaves that are densely packed, giving the plant a compact, shrub-like appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous cones, and its most striking feature is the pale coloration of its foliage, which contrasts with the typical green of its parent species. This cultivar is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden settings."
