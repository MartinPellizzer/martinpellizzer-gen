    "intro": "Centella asiatica var. crispata, commonly known as Asiatic pennywort, is a variant of the centella genus native to Southeast Asia. It is a low-growing, creeping herb characterized by its small, overlapping leaves that are often curled or wavy in appearance. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or wetlands. It is valued for its medicinal properties, including its potential to support skin healing and cognitive function. The varietal distinction of crispata is primarily based on the morphology of its leaves, which exhibit a more pronounced crinkled texture compared to the standard variety."
