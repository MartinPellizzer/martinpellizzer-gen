    "intro": "Callitriche autumnalis f. microphylla-pedicellata, commonly known as the small-leaved water starwort, is a variant of the water starwort species. It is a semi-aquatic plant characterized by its small, narrow leaves and delicate, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are usually less than 1 cm in length, and the inflorescence consists of small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. This variant is notable for its compact growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize wetland soils."
