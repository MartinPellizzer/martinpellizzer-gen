    "intro": "Cyperus uniflorus var. retroflexus, commonly known as the narrowleaf spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often submerged or partially emergent. Its rhizomes are extensive, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands. The species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
