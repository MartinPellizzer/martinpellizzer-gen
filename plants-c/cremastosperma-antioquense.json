    "intro": "Cremastosperma antioquense, commonly known as the Antioquian burrbean, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its legume fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its distinctive pod-like fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a hard, burred covering. Its botanical features include compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
