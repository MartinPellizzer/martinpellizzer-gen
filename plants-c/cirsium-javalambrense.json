It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in mountainous regions. Its foliage is covered in stiff, bristly hairs, which help protect it from herbivores. The species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
