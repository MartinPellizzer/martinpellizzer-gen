    "intro": "Cereus engelmannii var. variegatus, commonly known as the variegated night bloomer, is a cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its segmented stems covered in white, woolly spines and striking, large, white flowers that open at night. The plant thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces a short, branched stem with a distinctive variegated pattern. This species is popular among cactus enthusiasts for its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit."
