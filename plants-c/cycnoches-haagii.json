    "intro": "Cycnoches haagii, commonly known as the Haag's cycnoches, is a rare and delicate orchid native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, velvety texture, which helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Cycnoches haagii is considered a conservation concern."
