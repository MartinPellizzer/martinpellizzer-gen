It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along waterways, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually arranged in dense spikes, and it often serves as a habitat for various aquatic organisms.
