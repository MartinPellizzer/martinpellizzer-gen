It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Candollea polypodioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
