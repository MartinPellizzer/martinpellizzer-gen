    "intro": "Callista williamsonii, commonly known as the Williamson's callista, is a rare and critically endangered flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, often in clusters along the stems. The plant has a slender, upright growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in sandy soils near the coast and is adapted to withstand salt spray and coastal winds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
