    "intro": "Centaurium erythraea subsp. bifrons, commonly known as the twin-flowered centaury, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The subspecies bifrons differs from the typical C. erythraea by having two pairs of lobes on its corolla, giving it a distinctive appearance. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
