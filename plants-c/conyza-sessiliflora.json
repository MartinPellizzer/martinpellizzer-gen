    "intro": "Conyza sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessileleaf fleabane, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk, and are usually hairy. Conyza sessiliflora is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads."
