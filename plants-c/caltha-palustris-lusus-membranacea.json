    "intro": "Caltha palustris lusus membranacea, commonly known as the swamp crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has slender, branching stems that arise from a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread across moist soil. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The species is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks, where it thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich water."
