    "intro": "Chenopodium trigonon subsp. trigonon, commonly known as wild spinach, is a herbaceous annual plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture, often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense, branched clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are small, dry, and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. This species is valued for its edible leaves, which are rich in nutrients and have been used in traditional cuisines."
