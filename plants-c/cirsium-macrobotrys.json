    "intro": "Cirsium macrobotrys, commonly known as the giant thistle, is a perennial plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, spiny leaves and showy purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and wetlands. Its flowering stems can reach heights of up to 2 meters, making it one of the tallest thistle species. The plant plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
