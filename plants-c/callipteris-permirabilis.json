    "intro": "Callipteris permirabilis, commonly known as the silky sand pine, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to the coastal regions of southern Florida and the Bahamas. It is a small, evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, gray-green foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by dark blue, edible berries. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant."
