    "intro": "Coelostelma, commonly known as the \"star vine,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. They are characterized by their trailing growth habit and showy, star-shaped flowers that often have a tubular corolla. The leaves are typically alternate and can be ovate to elliptic in shape. Coelostelma species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are relatively easy to grow in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light."
