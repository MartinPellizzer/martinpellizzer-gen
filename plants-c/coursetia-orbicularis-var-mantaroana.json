    "intro": "Coursetia orbicularis var. mantaroana, commonly known as the Mantaro coursetia, is a shrub native to the high Andes of Peru. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, orbicular leaves that are typically pubescent. The plant produces yellow flowers in terminal clusters, which bloom during the dry season. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
