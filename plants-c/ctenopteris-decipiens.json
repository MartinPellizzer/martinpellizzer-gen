    "intro": "Ctenopteris decipiens, commonly known as the false button fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of the true button fern, though it belongs to a different genus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of tiny, scale-like structures. Ctenopteris decipiens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, indoor conditions."
