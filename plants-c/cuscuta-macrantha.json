    "intro": "Cuscuta macrantha, commonly known as giant dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, white or yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to North America and can be found growing on a variety of herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through the movement of the host plant. Cuscuta macrantha plays a role in ecological systems by influencing the growth and distribution of its host species."
