    "intro": "Clinogyne baumannii, commonly known as the coastal or seaside dandelion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant features bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in saline environments. Clinogyne baumannii plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides nectar for pollinators."
