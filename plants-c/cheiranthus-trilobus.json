    "intro": "Cheiranthus trilobus, commonly known as the three-lobed wallflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with characteristic four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and it produces small, elongated seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Cheiranthus trilobus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
