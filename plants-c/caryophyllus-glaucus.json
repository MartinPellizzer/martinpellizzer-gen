    "intro": "Caryophyllus glaucus, commonly known as the glaucous carnation, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces showy, bilaterally symmetrical flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, often with a glaucous (waxy) coating on its leaves and stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, typically from spring to early summer."
