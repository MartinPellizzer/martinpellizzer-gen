It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
