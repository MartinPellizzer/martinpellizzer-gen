It is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine, rough hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown, and it thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes and pond edges. Cyperus scaber is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found in disturbed soils near water bodies. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
