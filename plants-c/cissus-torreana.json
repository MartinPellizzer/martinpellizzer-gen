    "intro": "Cissus torreana, commonly known as the rock fig or climbing fig, is a vigorous vine native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into edible, fig-like fruits. Its stems are succulent and can climb using tendrils, making it well adapted to rocky or arid environments. Cissus torreana is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
