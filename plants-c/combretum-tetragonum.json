    "intro": "Combretum tetragonum, commonly known as the four-cornered combretum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its quadrangular, often hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-white flowers that are typically borne in terminal or axillary inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Combretum tetragonum is often found in woodland and savanna habitats, and it plays a role in local ecosystems as a source of food and shelter for various wildlife species."
