    "intro": "Cirsium polyanthos, commonly known as the showy thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, showy purple to pink flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a cluster of small, yellow flowers within the larger composite flower head, which is typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. Cirsium polyanthos is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun."
