    "intro": "Coprosma kauensis, commonly known as Kauai coprosma, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal and lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
