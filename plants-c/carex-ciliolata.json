    "intro": "Carex ciliolata, commonly known as the soft-haired sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. This species is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves with fine, ciliate margins that give it its common name. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Carex ciliolata produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are clustered in a cylindrical inflorescence."
