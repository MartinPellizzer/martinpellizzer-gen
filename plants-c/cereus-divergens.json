It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stem and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The species is popular in horticulture for its striking appearance and unique flowering behavior."
