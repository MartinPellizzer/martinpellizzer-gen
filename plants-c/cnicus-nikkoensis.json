It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils, often in mountainous regions. Its foliage is covered in stiff, spiny hairs, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
