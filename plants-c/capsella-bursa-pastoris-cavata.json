    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris cavata, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a small annual herbaceous plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit, with hairy stems and alternate, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, followed by triangular, seed-containing pods that burst open when mature. It is native to Europe but has been naturalized in many parts of the world, often growing in disturbed soils and along pathways. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments."
