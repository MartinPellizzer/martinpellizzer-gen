    "intro": "Cullen gaudichaudianum, commonly known as the Gaudichaud's cullen, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are alternate and palmately lobed, while its flowers range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive red or purple throat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
