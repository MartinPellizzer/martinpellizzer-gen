    "intro": "Cyclosorus \u00d7 rolandii, commonly known as the hybrid water fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Cyclosorus australis and Cyclosorus rotundifolius. It is a member of the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that form a rosette structure. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually rounded or heart-shaped, with a smooth or slightly lobed margin. Cyclosorus \u00d7 rolandii is often used in ecological studies to understand hybridization and speciation in aquatic plants."
