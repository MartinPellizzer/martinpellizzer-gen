    "intro": "Chaenactis macrantha, commonly known as the tall yellow globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy yellow flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It is a perennial species that blooms from July to September, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
