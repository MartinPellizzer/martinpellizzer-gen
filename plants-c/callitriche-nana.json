    "intro": "Callitriche nana, commonly known as dwarf water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has tiny, star-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base, with slender, branching stems. Its flowers are small, white or pale green, and appear in clusters, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Callitriche nana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
