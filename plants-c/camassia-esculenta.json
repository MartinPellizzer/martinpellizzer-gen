    "intro": "Camassia esculenta, commonly known as camas, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible bulbs that were historically harvested by indigenous peoples for food. Camas thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and meadows. Its ecological importance includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a traditional food source."
