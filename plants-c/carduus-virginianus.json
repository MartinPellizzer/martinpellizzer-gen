    "intro": "Carduus virginianus, commonly known as the Virginia thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 2 meters tall, covered in coarse, hairy texture. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with ray florets that resemble dandelions, typically blooming from late spring to early fall. Its leaves are deeply lobed, with a rough texture and a characteristic scent when crushed. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields, and it has been used historically for its medicinal properties."
