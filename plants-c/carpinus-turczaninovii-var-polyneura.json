    "intro": "Carpinus turczaninovii var. polyneura, commonly known as the Chinese hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in the spring, which are followed by small, oval-shaped nuts. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The varietal form, polyneura, is distinguished by its more pronounced branching pattern and slightly different leaf morphology."
