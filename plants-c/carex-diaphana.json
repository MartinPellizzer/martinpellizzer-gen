    "intro": "Carex diaphana, commonly known as the ghost sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it produces distinctive, translucent, waxy seeds. Carex diaphana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
