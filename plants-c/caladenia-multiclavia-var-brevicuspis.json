    "intro": "Caladenia multiclavia var. brevicuspis, commonly known as the short-horned spider orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to Western Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, intricate flowers. The plant produces pale yellow or greenish-white blooms with a distinctive, narrow spur at the base of each petal. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat destruction."
