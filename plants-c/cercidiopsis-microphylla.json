    "intro": "Cercidiopsis microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved burro bush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, spiny pods. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to poor soil conditions. Its drought tolerance and ability to fix nitrogen make it an important plant in desert ecosystems."
