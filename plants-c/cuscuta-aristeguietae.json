    "intro": "Cuscuta aristeguietae, commonly known as the Chilean dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina, and is often found growing on shrubs and trees. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and native vegetation."
