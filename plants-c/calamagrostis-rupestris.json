    "intro": "Calamagrostis rupestris, commonly known as the rock grass or cliff grass, is a perennial grass native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe and Asia. It has slender, upright stems that often form dense clumps, and its leaves are narrow, blue-green, and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles of pale green to golden flowers in late summer. It is well adapted to poor, well-drained soils and can tolerate harsh weather conditions. Calamagrostis rupestris is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
