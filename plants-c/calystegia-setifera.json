    "intro": "Calystegia setifera, commonly known as the hairy bindweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and distinctive hairy stems. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and persistent nature make it both a weed and a sometimes cultivated ornamental plant."
