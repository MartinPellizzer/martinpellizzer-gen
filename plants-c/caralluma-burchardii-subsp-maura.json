    "intro": "Caralluma burchardii subsp. maura, commonly known as the Maura prickly pear, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its leaves are reduced to small spines, which help reduce water loss. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience."
