    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. glandifera, commonly known as the European hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and serrated leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces catkin-like male flowers and female flowers that develop into edible nuts enclosed in a spiky husk. The nuts are typically harvested in the fall and are used in both culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and nut production."
