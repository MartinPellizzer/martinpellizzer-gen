    "intro": "Cirsium subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine thistle, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, purple to pinkish flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cirsium subalpinum plays an important role in alpine ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various insects and small animals."
