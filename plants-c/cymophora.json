    "intro": "Cymophora, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Cymophora excelsa, which is native to tropical Africa. The plant is characterized by its large, compound leaves and showy, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The wood of Cymophora is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it important in local timber industries."
