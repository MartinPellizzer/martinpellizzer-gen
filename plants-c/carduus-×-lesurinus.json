It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flowers, which are typically composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets. The plant is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry grasslands. It grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
