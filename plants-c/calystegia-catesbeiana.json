    "intro": "Calystegia catesbeiana, commonly known as the false bindweed, is a perennial vine native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant has a strong, creeping growth habit and can spread aggressively, often forming dense mats. Its stems are covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, disturbed soils. It is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
