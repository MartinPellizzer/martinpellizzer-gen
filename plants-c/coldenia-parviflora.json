    "intro": "[WRONG START] Colderia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered coldenia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in cymes, often with a faintly aromatic scent. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
