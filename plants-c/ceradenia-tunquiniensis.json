    "intro": "Ceradenia tunquiniensis, commonly known as the Tunquin fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates. Due to habitat loss, Ceradenia tunquiniensis is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
