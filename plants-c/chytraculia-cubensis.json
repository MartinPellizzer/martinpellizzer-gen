    "intro": "Chytraculia cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban chytraculia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Cuba. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
