    "intro": "Cynanchum sublanceolatum, commonly known as Chinese milkweed or wild ginseng, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by follicles containing toxic, milky sap. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its toxic compounds, it is not typically used in traditional medicine but has ecological significance as a food source for certain insects."
