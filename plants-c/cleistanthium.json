    "intro": "Cleistanthium, commonly known as the \"false hibiscus,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of approximately 100 species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees with simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. Cleistanthium species often have capsule fruits that release seeds through a unique mechanism involving a spiral twist. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and some species are used in traditional medicine."
