    "intro": "Cotyledon hispida, commonly known as the woolly cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though it is primarily cultivated for ornamental purposes. Cotyledon hispida is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water to thrive."
