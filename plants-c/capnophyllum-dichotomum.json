    "intro": "Capnophyllum dichotomum, commonly known as the forked-leaved plant, is a unique species characterized by its dichotomous branching pattern. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along its stem. Its flowers are inconspicuous, consisting of tiny, greenish-white blooms that appear in clusters. Capnophyllum dichotomum is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it an important indicator species for certain ecosystems."
