    "intro": "Cardopatium apulum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and Asia. It has long, narrow leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic conditions. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are pollinated by wind or insects. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in marshy areas. Cardopatium apulum is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats."
