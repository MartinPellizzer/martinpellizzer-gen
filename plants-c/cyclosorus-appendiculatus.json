    "intro": "Cyclosorus appendiculatus, commonly known as the appendiculate water fern, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its floating, four-leaf clover-like structure, which consists of four small, kidney-shaped leaves arranged in a rosette. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. Its reproductive structures, called glochidia, are attached to the leaves and release spores for propagation. Cyclosorus appendiculatus plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
