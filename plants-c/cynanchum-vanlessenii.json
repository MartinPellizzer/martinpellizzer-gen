    "intro": "Cynanchum vanlessenii, commonly known as the Vanlessen's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are followed by distinctive, spiny fruits containing seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
