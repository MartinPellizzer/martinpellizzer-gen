    "intro": "Cereus militaris, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The flowers typically last only one night, making it a rare and striking sight in the desert landscape."
