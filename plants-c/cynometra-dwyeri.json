    "intro": "Cynometra dwyeri, commonly known as the Dwyer's ironwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the rainforests of western Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slightly waxy texture. Its small, white flowers are clustered in inflorescences and are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in shaded environments, making it an important component of the forest understory."
