It is characterized by its basal rosette of kidney-shaped leaves and slender, branching stems that bear small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor similar to other watercress species. Botanically, it is notable for its distinctive leaf morphology and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
