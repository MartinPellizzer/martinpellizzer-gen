    "intro": "Coniothele californica, commonly known as the California coniothele, is a small, annual herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are inconspicuous, consisting of tiny, clustered structures that produce lightweight seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
