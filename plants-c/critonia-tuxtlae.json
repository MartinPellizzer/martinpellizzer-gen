    "intro": "Critonia tuxtlae, commonly known as the Tuxtla critonia, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid forests of southern Mexico. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense, pendulous clusters. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to habitat loss, Critonia tuxtlae is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
