    "intro": "Calamagrostis corsica, commonly known as the Corsican reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as riverbanks and coastal areas. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces feathery, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands. Calamagrostis corsica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
