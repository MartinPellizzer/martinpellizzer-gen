    "intro": "Cladothrix lanuginosa var. carnosa, commonly known as the hairy stonewort, is a freshwater algae belonging to the order Botryopsales. It is characterized by its filamentous structure, with branching filaments covered in a dense layer of mucilage. The plant forms colonies that can resemble small, gelatinous masses, often found attached to submerged surfaces in slow-moving water. Its morphology includes a central axis with lateral branches, and it exhibits a distinctive appearance due to its hairy texture. This variant is notable for its adaptability to a range of aquatic environments and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
