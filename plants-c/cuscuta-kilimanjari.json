    "intro": "Cuscuta kilimanjari, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It is native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa, particularly around Mount Kilimanjaro. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched stem covered in tiny, adhesive structures called haustoria, which attach to the host. It is often found on grasses and shrubs, forming dense mats that can smother the host vegetation. Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its environment."
