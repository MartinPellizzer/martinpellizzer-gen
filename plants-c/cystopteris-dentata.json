    "intro": "Cystopteris dentata, commonly known as the toothed water fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, triangular fronds that are often divided into small, tooth-like segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in wetlands. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to moist substrates. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid habitats."
