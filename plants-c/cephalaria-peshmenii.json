    "intro": "Cephalaria peshmenii, commonly known as the Peshmenii's goldenhead, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy foliage. The plant produces yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Cephalaria peshmenii is often found growing in rocky soils and along riverbanks, where it thrives in full sun."
