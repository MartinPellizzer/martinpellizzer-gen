It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and exhibits a compact growth habit with upright stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale blue, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Clypeola montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
