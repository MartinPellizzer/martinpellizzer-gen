    "intro": "Crataegus spes-aestatum, commonly known as the summer-berry hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of small white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red berries in the autumn, which are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. Crataegus spes-aestatum is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
