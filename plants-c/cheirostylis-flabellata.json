    "intro": "Cheirostylis flabellata, commonly known as the fan-leafed orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, showy, pale yellow or greenish-white flower. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its flowers are often short-lived, lasting only a few days, and it blooms during the spring or early summer. The orchid's unique floral structure and habitat preferences make it a distinctive member of the Orchidaceae family."
