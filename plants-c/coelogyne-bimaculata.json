It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters of 5 to 10. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Coelogyne bimaculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
