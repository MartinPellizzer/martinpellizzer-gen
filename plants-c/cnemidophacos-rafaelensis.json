    "intro": "Cnemidophacos rafaelensis, commonly known as the Rafael's spiny scale, is a unique species of scale insect belonging to the family Diaspididae. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated body covered in a waxy, protective shield. This plant parasite is primarily found in the Neotropical region, particularly in areas of Central and South America. The insect's life cycle involves several stages, including egg, crawler, and adult, with the crawler stage being the most mobile. Due to its specialized feeding habits, it can cause significant damage to its host plants, making it an important subject in ecological and agricultural studies."
