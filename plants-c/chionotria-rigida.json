    "intro": "Chionotria rigida, commonly known as the rigid snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine soils, and is adapted to cold climates. Its rigid, woody stems and dense, leathery leaves help it withstand harsh weather conditions. Chionotria rigida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
