    "intro": "Carex pauciflora var. microglochin, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its low-growing habit and ability to stabilize soil, it is valued in ecological restoration projects."
