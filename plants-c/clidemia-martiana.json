It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. It has a creeping growth habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Clidemia martiana is often found in disturbed habitats and can be invasive in certain areas."
