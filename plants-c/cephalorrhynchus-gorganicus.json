    "intro": "Cephalorrhynchus gorganicus, commonly known as the Gorgan skull orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, featuring a prominent, helmet-like lip that sets it apart from other orchid species. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and moderate climates. Its flowers are usually small and pale, with a complex arrangement that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cephalorrhynchus gorganicus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
