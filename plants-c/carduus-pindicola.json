It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly the Pindus Mountains in Greece. The plant is characterized by its spiny leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky and dry environments, often found in alpine and subalpine zones. Carduus pindicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and has also been studied for its potential ecological roles in its native habitats."
