    "intro": "Camara trifolia var. normalis, commonly known as the common wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves, each leaflet being heart-shaped with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. The plant is known for its edible leaves, though they should be consumed in moderation due to their oxalic acid content."
