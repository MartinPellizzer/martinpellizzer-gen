    "intro": "Cereus conzattii, commonly known as the Conzatti's night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking white flowers that open at night, emitting a fragrant scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system adapted to store water. Cereus conzattii is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens."
