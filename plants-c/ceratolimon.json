It is characterized by its distinctive, often spiky or horn-like floral structures that give it its common name. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and red. Ceratolimon species are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in gardens for their unique appearance."
