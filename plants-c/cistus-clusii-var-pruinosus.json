    "intro": "Cistus clusii var. pruinosus, commonly known as the Prunose Rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its gray-green, glandular leaves that are covered in a powdery waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
