    "intro": "Cynorkis cylindrostachys, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant with a stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves that are blue-green in color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as an ornamental plant."
