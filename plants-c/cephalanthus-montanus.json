It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its showy, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or streamside habitats. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a slight pubescence. The fruit is a small, dark red drupe that develops from the flower and is an important food source for birds and small mammals."
