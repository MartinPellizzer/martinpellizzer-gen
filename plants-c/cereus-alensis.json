    "intro": "Cereus alensis, commonly known as the desert rose, is a cacti species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach up to 6 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming at night. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss in its harsh environment. Cereus alensis is well adapted to extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems."
