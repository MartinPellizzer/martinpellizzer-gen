    "intro": "Centaurea procumbens var. jordaniana, commonly known as Jordanian sand centaury, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East. It features slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves. Its foliage is typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
