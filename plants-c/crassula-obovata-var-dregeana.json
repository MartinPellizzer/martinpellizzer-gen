    "intro": "Crassula obovata var. dregeana, commonly known as the Drege's Crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, rounded rosettes of thick, fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are obovate in shape. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its slow growth rate and ornamental appearance make it a desirable addition to both indoor and outdoor collections."
