    "intro": "Cypripedium tibeticum subsp. calcicola, commonly known as the Tibetan calcicola lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. This subspecies is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically pale pink to white in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its alpine habitat. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves and produces a single flower per stem, making it a visually striking yet elusive species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
