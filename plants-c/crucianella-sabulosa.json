    "intro": "Crucianella sabulosa, commonly known as the sand flatbean, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Africa. It is a small, herbaceous shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round, green fruits that mature to a reddish color. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture, adapted to withstand salty and windy conditions. Crucianella sabulosa plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
