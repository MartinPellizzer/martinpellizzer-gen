    "intro": "Chenopodium album var. pseudopulifolium, commonly known as tumbleweed, is a flowering plant in the Amaranthaceae family. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and the production of dry, wind-dispersed fruits. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are often branched and succulent. This variant is notable for its ability to form large, flaky masses that break apart easily, aiding in seed dispersal."
