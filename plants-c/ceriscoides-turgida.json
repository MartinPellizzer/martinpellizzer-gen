    "intro": "Ceriscoides turgida, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes spread along the water's surface, forming dense mats that provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. The fronds are divided into small, delicate pinnae, which are covered in fine, hair-like structures that aid in water retention."
