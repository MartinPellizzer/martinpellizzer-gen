    "intro": "Cirsium arvense var. tomentosum, commonly known as the hairy thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and leaves, which are covered in fine, white tomentum. The plant produces purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and wastelands. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in agricultural areas."
