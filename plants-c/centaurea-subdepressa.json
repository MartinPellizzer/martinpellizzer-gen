    "intro": "Centaurea subdepressa, commonly known as the creeping cornflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, with a compact rosette structure that helps it survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with red markings, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens."
