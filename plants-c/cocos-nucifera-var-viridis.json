    "intro": "Cocos nucifera var. viridis, commonly known as the green coconut, is a variant of the coconut palm characterized by its distinctively green, unripe fruit. This plant is native to tropical regions and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. The leaves are large, feather-like, and provide shade, while the trunk is straight and sturdy. The fruit develops in clusters and contains a clear liquid known as coconut water, which is rich in nutrients. This variety is often cultivated for both its fruit and ornamental value in tropical landscapes."
