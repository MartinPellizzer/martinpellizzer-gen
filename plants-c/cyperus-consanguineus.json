    "intro": "Cyperus consanguineus, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often forming dense stands in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Its slender, grass-like leaves are usually arranged in a triangular cross-section, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
