It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Ceanothus leucodermis is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to attract pollinators."
