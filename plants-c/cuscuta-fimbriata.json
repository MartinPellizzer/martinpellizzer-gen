    "intro": "Cuscuta fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that begins with seeds germinating on the surface of host plants. The plant forms a dense network of yellow, thread-like stems that wrap around its host, extracting water and nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria. It is native to various regions in the Americas and is often found on crops like soybeans and sunflowers. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural plants."
