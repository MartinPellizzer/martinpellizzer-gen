    "intro": "Cyrtochilum ospinae, commonly known as the Ospina's slipper orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper, a feature common among orchids. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark without deriving nutrients from its host. It produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, often blooming during the cooler months. Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, Cyrtochilum ospinae is highly threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
