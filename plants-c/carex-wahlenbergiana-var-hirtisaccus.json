    "intro": "Carex wahlenbergiana var. hirtisaccus, commonly known as the hairy-leaved sedge, is a perennial plant native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with hairy textures on the leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spiky cluster of small, three-lobed flowers. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
