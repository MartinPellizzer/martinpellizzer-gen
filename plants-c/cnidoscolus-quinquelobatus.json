    "intro": "Cnidoscolus quinquelobatus, commonly known as the arrowhead plant or \"pupunheira\" in Brazil, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves, which are typically lobed and have a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by edible, spiny fruits containing a starchy, tuberous seed. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is adapted to tropical climates with high humidity."
