It is a member of the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnately arranged leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by triangular, fibrous fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and for thatching, while the plant itself is adapted to coastal and wetland environments. Chrysalidocarpus lutescens plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
