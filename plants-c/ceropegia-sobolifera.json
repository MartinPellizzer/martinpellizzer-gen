    "intro": "Ceropegia sobolifera, commonly known as the African violet or velvet plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that often trail or climb, and its leaves are typically thick and fleshy with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually white or pale purple, which are pollinated by specific moths. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Ceropegia sobolifera is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
