    "intro": "Carex elata f. pendula, commonly known as the pendulous sedge, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its tall, slender stems that often droop gracefully, giving it a weeping appearance. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of greenish-yellow flowers, which are typical of the sedge family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a dark green color and a slightly glossy surface. Native to moist, temperate regions, it thrives in wetlands and is often used in ornamental gardening for its elegant, flowing form."
