It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy pubescence. Its flowers are white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This variant is distinguished by its hairy foliage and preference for wet habitats."
