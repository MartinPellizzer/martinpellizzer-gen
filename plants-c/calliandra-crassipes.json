    "intro": "Calliandra crassipes, commonly known as the rough calliandra, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, delicate leaflets and its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its root system helps prevent soil erosion, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects. The flowers are also a valuable nectar source for bees and other pollinators."
