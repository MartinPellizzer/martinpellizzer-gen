    "intro": "Caralluma rubiginosa, commonly known as the red-stemmed devil\u2019s backbone, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its branched, cylindrical stems that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are small and scale-like, adapted to minimize water loss in its harsh environment. Caralluma rubiginosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
