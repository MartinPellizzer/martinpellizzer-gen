    "intro": "Cyrtandra uapouensis, commonly known as the Uapou endemic cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the island of Uapou in French Polynesia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. The plant is often found growing in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, berry-like fruits that are dispersed by birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
