    "intro": "Corynophallus consimilis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique parasitic plant belonging to the family Rafflesieae. It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll and its reliance on host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other species. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color. These flowers emit a strong, often unpleasant odor to attract specific pollinators, such as flies. Due to its specialized growth habits and limited distribution, Corynophallus consimilis is considered rare and of interest in botanical studies."
