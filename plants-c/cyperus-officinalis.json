It is a perennial herb characterized by its triangular, grass-like stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, making it a common sight in wetlands and along waterways. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. The leaves and stems are also utilized in various cultural and practical applications, including basket-making and as a natural filter in water systems."
