    "intro": "Carex brevihispida, commonly known as the short-hairy sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flower heads. Native to North America, it thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes and wetlands. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or brown in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
