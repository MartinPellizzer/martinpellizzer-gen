    "intro": "Cymbachne guineensis subvar. squamulata, commonly known as the Guinea grass variant, is a perennial grass species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-gray sheen. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its high biomass and adaptability, it plays a significant role in both ecological systems and agricultural landscapes."
