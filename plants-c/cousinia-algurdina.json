    "intro": "Cousinia algurdina, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. Cousinia algurdina is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
