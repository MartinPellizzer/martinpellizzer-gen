It is characterized by its yellow flowers and sticky, glandular leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sagebrush steppe and rocky soils. Its leaves are lanceolate, meaning they are narrow and tapering at the ends, and are covered in fine hairs. The species is part of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
