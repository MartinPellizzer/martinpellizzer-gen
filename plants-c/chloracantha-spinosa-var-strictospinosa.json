    "intro": "Chloracantha spinosa var. strictospinosa, commonly known as the stiff-spined spurge, is a variant of the spurge family (Euphorbiaceae) characterized by its dense, sharp spines. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought conditions. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are usually covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a feature common in the Euphorbiaceae family. The latex it produces is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it a plant to handle with care."
