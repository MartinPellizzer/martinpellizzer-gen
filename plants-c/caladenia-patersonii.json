    "intro": "Caladenia patersonii, commonly known as the Paterson's glory-of-the-snow, is an orchid species native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and often feature a distinctive red or orange lip. The plant typically grows in sandy soils and is found in open habitats such as heathlands and woodlands. It blooms during the cooler months, usually between June and August, and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
