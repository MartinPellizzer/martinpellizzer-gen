    "intro": "Cyphia gerrardii, commonly known as the Florida panhandle sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy soils along coastal dunes and maritime hammocks. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Cyphia gerrardii has adapted to coastal environments with its drought-resistant traits and ability to tolerate salt spray. It plays an important role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local pollinator populations."
