    "intro": "Cathartocarpus bacillaris, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It has a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers followed by small, round, blue berries that are edible for some animals. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and coastal dunes. Cathartocarpus bacillaris plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife in its native environment."
