    "intro": "Centrosema floridanum, commonly known as Florida centrosema, is a leguminous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Due to its ecological benefits, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage crop for livestock."
