    "intro": "Cymbidium tracyanum, commonly known as the Tracy orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically blooms in late winter to early spring, making it a prized addition to orchid collections. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered in a thick layer of brownish bark, which helps it store water. The Tracy orchid is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright light and moderate watering to thrive."
