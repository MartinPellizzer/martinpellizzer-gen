    "intro": "Cyclosorus nephrodioides, commonly known as the kidney-leaf water fern, is a aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that resemble the shape of a kidney, typically measuring up to 1.5 centimeters in diameter. The plant has four leaflets arranged in a whorl, with each leaflet having a slightly notched margin. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. Cyclosorus nephrodioides plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
