    "intro": "Cleiemera hederacea, commonly known as creeping cleiemera, is a low-growing perennial plant native to certain regions of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hair, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense ground cover."
