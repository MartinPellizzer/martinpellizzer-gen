    "intro": "Cynoglossum creticum subvar. pseudocheirifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hound's tongue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features basal leaves that are narrow and tongue-shaped, with a distinctive bluish-green coloration. The plant produces small, violet to purple flowers in late summer, typically arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
