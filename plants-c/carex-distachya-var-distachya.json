    "intro": "Carex distachya var. distachya, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants commonly found in wetlands and moist soils. The plant features cylindrical, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences with small, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in shallow water or damp ground, making it a valuable species for wetland restoration. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
