    "intro": "Cardamine raphanifolia f. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered watercress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland areas. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor similar to other members of the mustard family. The f. grandiflora form is distinguished by its larger, more showy flowers compared to the typical species."
