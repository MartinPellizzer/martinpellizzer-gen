    "intro": "Cola louisii, commonly known as African cola or black cola, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries like Ghana, Nigeria, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers that develop into woody pods containing elliptical seeds. The seeds are often used in traditional medicine and have a bitter taste due to the presence of caffeine and other alkaloids. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance."
