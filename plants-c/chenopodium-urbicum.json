    "intro": "Chenopodium urbicum, commonly known as city goosefoot, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by edible, triangular seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found growing in urban environments, gardens, and along roadsides. Chenopodium urbicum is also known for its nutritional value, as its leaves can be consumed as a leafy green vegetable."
