    "intro": "Conothamnus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved everlasting, is a genus of flowering plants native to Australia. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its small, often fragrant flowers. The plants typically have narrow, needle-like leaves and produce small, clustered inflorescences. Conothamnus species are generally shrubs or subshrubs, adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in horticulture for their drought tolerance and attractive floral displays."
