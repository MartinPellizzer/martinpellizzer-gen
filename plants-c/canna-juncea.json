    "intro": "Canna juncea, commonly known as the Indian shot or narrow-leaf canna, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stalks and large, broad leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces clusters of showy, spadix-like flowers surrounded by colorful bracts, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its vibrant appearance. Canna juncea is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
