    "intro": "Claytonia barneoudii, commonly known as the Barneoud's springbeauty, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Portulacaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces showy, white or pinkish flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Claytonia barneoudii is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, such as slopes and meadows."
