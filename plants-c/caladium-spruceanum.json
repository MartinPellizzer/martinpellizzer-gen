    "intro": "Caladium spruceanum, commonly known as the spruceleaf arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. Its foliage is the main ornamental feature, making it popular in gardens and as a houseplant. Caladium spruceanum is typically propagated through tuberous roots, and it blooms with small, inconspicuous flowers that are not usually visible above the foliage."
