    "intro": "Carex arenaria f. pumila, commonly known as the sand sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and gravelly habitats in temperate regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, and it produces small, clustered spikes of inconspicuous flowers in the spring. The plant is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it a valuable addition to ecological restoration projects. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
