    "intro": "Croton micradenus, commonly known as the small-leaved croton, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, often hairy leaves that are small and ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spiny, fleshy fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
