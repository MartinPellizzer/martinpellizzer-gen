    "intro": "Carex serotina f. exigua, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to moist, acidic habitats such as bogs and wetlands. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and densely packed, forming a compact rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are usually borne on short, lateral branches. It thrives in full to partial shade and requires consistently moist soil conditions. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
