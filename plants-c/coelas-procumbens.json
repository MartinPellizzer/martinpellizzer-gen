    "intro": "Coelas procumbens, commonly known as the creeping coela, is a low-growing perennial plant native to certain regions of South America. It features elongated, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming during the warmer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common sight in rocky or sandy soils. Botanically, Coelas procumbens is valued for its adaptability and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
