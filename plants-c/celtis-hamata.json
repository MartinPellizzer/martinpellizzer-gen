    "intro": "Celtis hamata, commonly known as the Chinese hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually pubescent underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, round berries that are edible for some wildlife. Celtis hamata is often found in moist soils along riverbanks and in forested areas. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
