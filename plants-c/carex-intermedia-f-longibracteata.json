    "intro": "Carex intermedia f. longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, wet meadows, and along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence features elongated bracts that are often longer than the spikes themselves, giving it its distinguishing name. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
