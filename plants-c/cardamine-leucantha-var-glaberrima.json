It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white or pale yellow flowers. This variant is distinguished by its glabrous (smooth, hairless) appearance, which sets it apart from other varieties of Cardamine. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland areas. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential ecological roles in wetland habitats."
