    "intro": "Coryanthes rodriguesii, commonly known as the Rodrigues orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family native to the island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean. This plant is characterized by its large, intricate flowers that resemble a crown, with a central spur that serves as a nectar reservoir. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical forests. The plant's unique floral structure is adapted to specific pollinators, such as certain species of beetles. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
