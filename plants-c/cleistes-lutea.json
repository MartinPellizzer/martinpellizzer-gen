    "intro": "Cleistes lutea, commonly known as the yellow cleistocarp, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that are often hidden within its leafy bracts, a feature that makes it difficult to spot in the wild. The plant has a short flowering period, typically in late spring, and produces capsule fruits that contain its seeds. Its botanical structure includes opposite leaves and a unique, compact inflorescence. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Cleistes lutea is considered an endangered species in many parts of its range."
