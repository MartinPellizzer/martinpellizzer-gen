    "intro": "Castilleja applegatei var. viscida, commonly known as Applegate's sticky castilleja, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, red to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a sticky resin, which is a characteristic feature of the species. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas."
