    "intro": "Cyrtochilum werneri, commonly known as the Werneri's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant has a short, upright stem with few leaves, and its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the surrounding soil. Cyrtochilum werneri is often found in shaded, humid environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in the understory with partial sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
