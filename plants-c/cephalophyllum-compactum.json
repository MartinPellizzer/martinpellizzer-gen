    "intro": "Cephalophyllum compactum, commonly known as the compact cushion plant, is a unique succulent native to the rocky habitats of South Africa. It features a dense, low-growing rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the cooler months. Its compact form and ability to form clumps make it an attractive addition to rock gardens. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival."
