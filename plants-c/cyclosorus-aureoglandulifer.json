    "intro": "Cyclosorus aureoglandulifer, commonly known as the golden glandular cyclosorus, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in yellowish glands, giving it its common name. It is a non-vascular plant, meaning it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense. Cyclosorus aureoglandulifer is relatively rare and is often considered a cryptic species due to its subtle appearance and specialized habitat requirements."
