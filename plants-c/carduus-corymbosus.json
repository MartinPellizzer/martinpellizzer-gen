    "intro": "Carduus corymbosus, commonly known as the common cocklebur, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and has been naturalized in many parts of the world. The plant is characterized by its prickly leaves and spherical, spiny fruit heads, which contain seeds enclosed in a fibrous husk. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, fields, and waste areas. The plant's robust growth and adaptability make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
