    "intro": "Chilochloa boemeri, commonly known as the Boemeri's grass, is a species of flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
