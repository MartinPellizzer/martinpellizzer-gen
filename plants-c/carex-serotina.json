    "intro": "Carex serotina, commonly known as late-flowering sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets, which are borne on elongated stems. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Carex serotina is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
