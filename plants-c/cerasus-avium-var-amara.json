    "intro": "Cerasus avium var. amara, commonly known as the wild cherry or bird cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a slightly hairy underside. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during early spring, followed by small, dark red to black fruits that are edible but often tart. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in woodland edges or along riverbanks. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
