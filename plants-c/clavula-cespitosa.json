    "intro": "Clavula cespitosa, commonly known as the tufted clavula, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It features a compact, rosette-like growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of purple or pink, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
