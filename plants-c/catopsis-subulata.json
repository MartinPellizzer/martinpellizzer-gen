    "intro": "Catopsis subulata, commonly known as the slender catopsis, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is a small, evergreen bromeliad that typically grows in shaded, humid environments. The plant features narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help retain moisture. It produces small, white flowers that are borne in a spike, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its delicate nature, it requires careful attention to watering and light conditions to thrive."
