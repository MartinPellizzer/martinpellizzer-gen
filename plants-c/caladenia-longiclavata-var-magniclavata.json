    "intro": "Caladenia longiclavata var. magniclavata, commonly known as the large-clawed spider orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family native to Western Australia. This variant is distinguished by its elongated, recurved sepals and petals that resemble the legs of a spider, giving it its common name. The flowers are typically pale yellow to orange in color, with a distinctive hooded labellum that adds to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as heathlands and woodlands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
