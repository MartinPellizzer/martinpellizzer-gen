    "intro": "Connarus euphlebius subsp. moluccanus, commonly known as the Moluccan connarus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the islands of Indonesia, particularly the Moluccas, where it thrives in tropical rainforest environments. The plant is characterized by its woody structure, with smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution."
