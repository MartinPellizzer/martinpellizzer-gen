    "intro": "Crataegus stipulacea, commonly known as the stipuleleaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often adorned with stipules, small leaf-like structures at the base of the petiole. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its fruit is a red, fleshy berry that matures in the fall, providing food for various wildlife. Crataegus stipulacea is often found in moist, open woods and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight."
