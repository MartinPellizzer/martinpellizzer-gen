    "intro": "Cleome sonorae, commonly known as the Sonoran morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Sonoran Desert region of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is an annual herb that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring hairy stems and alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, opening in the morning and closing by midday. Cleome sonorae thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its rapid growth and ability to bloom quickly make it a characteristic plant of disturbed or open habitats in the desert."
