    "intro": "Carex aristata subsp. raddei, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known for their ecological importance in wetland and moist habitats. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. It typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshes, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat structure."
