    "intro": "Cupressus cashmeriana, commonly known as the Kashmir cypress, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its narrow, pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves that are arranged in crossed pairs. The plant produces small, round cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. The Kashmir cypress is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
