    "intro": "Carex vulgaris var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This sedge is valued for its ecological role in supporting wetland biodiversity and its aesthetic appeal in landscaping."
