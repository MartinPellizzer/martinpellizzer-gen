It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and is characterized by its rough, grayish bark and thorny branches. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a rough texture. It produces white or pale pink flowers in spring, followed by red to orange berries in the fall. This plant is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along streambanks, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
