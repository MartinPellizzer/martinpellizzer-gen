It belongs to the Ulmaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by small, round berries, which are edible for some bird species. Celtis chinensis is often used in traditional Chinese medicine and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
