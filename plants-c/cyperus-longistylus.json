    "intro": "Cyperus longistylus, commonly known as the long-styled flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as swamps and floodplains, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Cyperus longistylus produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered at the tips of the stems. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, supporting various wildlife species."
