    "intro": "Cistus lasianthus subsp. alyssoides, commonly known as the alpine rock rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and north Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, leathery leaves and fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy species suited to Mediterranean climates. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
