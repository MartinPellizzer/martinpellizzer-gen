    "intro": "Crataegus berberifolia, commonly known as the yellowleaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its yellowish-green leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs, and its clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Botanically, it belongs to the Rosaceae family and is closely related to other hawthorn species. Its structure and foliage make it a distinctive and ecologically valuable plant in its native habitat."
