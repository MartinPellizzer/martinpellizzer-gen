    "intro": "Crepis trichocarpa, commonly known as the hairy mouse-ear, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its small, dandelion-like yellow flowers and hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and open habitats. It is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The plant produces achene fruits that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across different environments."
