    "intro": "Cirsium araneans, commonly known as the cat's ear, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy, heart-shaped leaves and its yellow to purple flower heads that resemble a spider's web. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, spiky seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Cirsium araneans is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
