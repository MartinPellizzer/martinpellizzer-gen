    "intro": "Calystegia purpurata, commonly known as the purple morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
