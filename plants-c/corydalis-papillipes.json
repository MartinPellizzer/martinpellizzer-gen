    "intro": "Corydalis papillipes, commonly known as the hairy poppy or hairy corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, papillate (bumpy) petals that give it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters, with slender stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers, which are usually pink or purple, bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a striking visual element to its habitat. Corydalis papillipes is often found in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates."
