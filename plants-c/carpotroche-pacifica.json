    "intro": "Carpotroche pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific carpotroche, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along shorelines and is adapted to withstand salt spray and tidal influences. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
