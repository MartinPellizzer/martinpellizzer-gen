    "intro": "Calamus aidae, commonly known as the Aida's arrowroot, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Araceae. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and produces a dense cluster of narrow, sword-shaped leaves. The plant is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its underground stems are used to extract a starchy substance, which is processed into a flour-like product. Due to its unique botanical features and traditional uses, it holds significance in both local cultures and botanical research."
