    "intro": "Caladenia cremna, commonly known as the Red-tipped Spider Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the south-eastern region of Australia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils within open forests and heathlands. The plant features a single, erect stem that bears a single, strikingly colored flower with a spider-like appearance. Its flower has a deep red or orange tip on the dorsal sepal and petals, contrasting with the greenish-yellow base. Caladenia cremna is a protected species due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity."
