It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking blue to purple flower heads, which are composed of numerous small, tubular florets. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy surface, and the plant produces a distinctive, bitter-tasting sap. It thrives in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
