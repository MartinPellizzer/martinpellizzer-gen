It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist or wet environments, such as marshes and riverbanks. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. Calamagrostis austrojeholensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
