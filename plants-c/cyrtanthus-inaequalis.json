    "intro": "Cyrtanthus inaequalis, commonly known as the unequal bell-shaped orchid, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that come in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, strap-like leaves and blooms in late winter to early spring. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Cyrtanthus inaequalis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
