    "intro": "Cereus pacificus, commonly known as the Pacific torch cactus, is a species of cactus native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It is a columnar cactus with a tall, unbranched stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, appearing at the ends of the stems during the night. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a deep root system adapted to arid environments. Cereus pacificus is well-suited for cultivation in warm climates with minimal water requirements."
