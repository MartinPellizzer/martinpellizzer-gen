    "intro": "Conospermum caeruleum subsp. oblanceolatum, commonly known as the blue conospermum, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that appear in dense clusters during the spring and summer months. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, which is reflected in its subspecies name. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and drought tolerance."
