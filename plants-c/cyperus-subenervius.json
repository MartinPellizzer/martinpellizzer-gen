    "intro": "Cyperus subenervius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as marshes and wetlands, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it a common component of aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats. Cyperus subenervius is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
