    "intro": "Colubrina tepicana, commonly known as Mexican beautyberry, is a shrub native to the southern United States and Mexico. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by violet-blue berries that attract birds. These berries are edible for birds but generally considered toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed sites."
