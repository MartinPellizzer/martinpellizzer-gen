    "intro": "Champereia oblongifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf champereia, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It features dense, evergreen foliage with lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its compact growth habit and ornamental leaves make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded landscapes. Champereia oblongifolia is relatively low-maintenance, thriving in well-drained soil and partial to full shade."
