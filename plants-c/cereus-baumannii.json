    "intro": "Cereus baumannii, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems and spiny, ribbed structure. The plant produces large, white flowers that open at night, emitting a strong fragrance. Its succulent leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in arid environments. Cereus baumannii is well adapted to desert conditions, storing water in its thick stems and thriving in full sun."
