    "intro": "Clidemia regnellii, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false cholla, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by round, fleshy fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Clidemia regnellii is also known for its ability to form dense colonies, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in certain areas."
