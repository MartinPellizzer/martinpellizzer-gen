    "intro": "Cistus densus, commonly known as the dense rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cistus densus is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
