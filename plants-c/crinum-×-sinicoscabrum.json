    "intro": "Crinum \u00d7 sinicoscabrum, commonly known as the hybrid crinum lily, is a striking plant characterized by its large, showy flowers. It is a natural hybrid between Crinum bulbisorium and Crinum candidum, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of long, strap-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The flowers, which can be white, pink, or purple, are borne on tall, slender stems and are highly fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
