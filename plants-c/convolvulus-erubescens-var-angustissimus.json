    "intro": "Convolvulus erubescens var. angustissimus, commonly known as the narrowleaf morning glory, is a climbing vine characterized by its slender, angular stems and heart-shaped leaves. It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red, typically blooming in the early morning. The plant is native to regions of southern Africa and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It has a rapid growth habit and can become invasive in certain environments if not managed. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though care must be taken to prevent its spread."
