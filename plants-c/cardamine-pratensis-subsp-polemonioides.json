    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis subsp. polemonioides, commonly known as the polemonioid watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and is typically found in moist, calcareous soils along stream banks and wet meadows. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers with five sepals and numerous stamens, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their supposed diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and habitat preferences compared to the main species, Cardamine pratensis."
