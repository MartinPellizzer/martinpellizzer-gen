    "intro": "Cyperus mulen-pullu, commonly known as the swamp spikerush, is a flowering plant belonging to the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical inflorescence that consists of numerous small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits that are dispersed by wind. Cyperus mulen-pullu plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
