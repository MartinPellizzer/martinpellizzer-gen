    "intro": "Caelestium, commonly known as the skyflower, is a rare and striking plant native to high-altitude regions. It features delicate, blue-violet petals that resemble the colors of the sky, giving it its poetic name. The plant has a compact, upright growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, caelestium is considered a botanical curiosity and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
