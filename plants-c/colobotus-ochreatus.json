    "intro": "Colobotus ochreatus, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, fleshy, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color, arranged in clusters. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Colobotus ochreatus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is often found in disturbed or dry environments."
