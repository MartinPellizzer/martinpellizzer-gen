It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy areas and is known for its delicate, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Cephalaria corniculata is often found in meadows and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun. Its unique, horn-like seed pods are a distinguishing feature of the species."
