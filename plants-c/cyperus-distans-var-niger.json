    "intro": "Cyperus distans var. niger, commonly known as black flatsedge, is a perennial herb native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically brown or black in color, giving it its common name. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies. Cyperus distans var. niger is known for its ability to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions, making it a common invasive species in some areas."
