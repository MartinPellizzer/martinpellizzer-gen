    "intro": "Coriaria angustissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved coriaria, is a small evergreen shrub native to the western Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. Due to its toxicity and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
