    "intro": "Calystegia sepium, commonly known as bindweed, is a climbing vine belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped, pale yellow to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a strong, persistent root system that allows it to spread aggressively and become invasive in many regions. Its stems are hairy and can twine around other plants or structures. Calystegia sepium is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in fields, where it can form dense mats."
