    "intro": "Colchicum kackarense, commonly known as the Kackaren colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the island of Kackaren in the South Pacific. It belongs to the Colchicaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a bulbous corm, which serves as its primary storage organ. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that emerge from the base of the plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
