    "intro": "Copernicia fallaensis, commonly known as the fallaensis wax palm, is a species of palm native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Cuba and the Isle of Youth. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by clustered fruits containing edible seeds. Its wax-like coating on the leaves has historically been used by indigenous peoples for various purposes. This species is of ecological and cultural significance in its native habitat."
