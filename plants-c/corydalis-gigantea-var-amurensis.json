    "intro": "Corydalis gigantea var. amurensis, commonly known as the Amur giant corydalis, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces showy, pinkish-purple flowers in early spring, which are clustered in cymes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a hairy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in moist, shady environments."
