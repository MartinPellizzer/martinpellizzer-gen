It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has hairy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens."
