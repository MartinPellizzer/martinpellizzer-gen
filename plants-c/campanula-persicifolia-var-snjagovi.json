    "intro": "Campanula persicifolia var. snjagovi, commonly known as the Balkan bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate, bell-like flowers and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
