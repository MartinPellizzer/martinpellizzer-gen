It features whorled leaves that are typically green to reddish in color, with a distinctive, wheel-like arrangement around the stem. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its roots help stabilize sediments, making it ecologically significant in aquatic ecosystems."
