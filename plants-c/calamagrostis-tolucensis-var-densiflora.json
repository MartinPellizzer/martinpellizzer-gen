    "intro": "Calamagrostis tolucensis var. densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flower bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces compact, spike-like inflorescences with dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
