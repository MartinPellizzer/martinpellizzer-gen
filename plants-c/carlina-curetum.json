    "intro": "Carlina curetum, commonly known as the roughhead cudweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture, and the flowers are usually pink or purple in color. Carlina curetum is often found in disturbed areas and can thrive in poor soil conditions."
