    "intro": "Convolvulus fruticulosus var. glandulosus, commonly known as the glandular hairy bindweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving the plant its distinctive texture. Its small, yellowish-white flowers are typically borne in clusters and bloom in late spring to early summer. This species is often considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings due to its rapid growth and persistent nature."
