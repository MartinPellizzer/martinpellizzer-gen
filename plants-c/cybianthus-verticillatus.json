    "intro": "Cybianthus verticillatus, commonly known as the clustered sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. Cybianthus verticillatus is adapted to saline and wind-prone environments, making it a resilient species in its natural habitat."
