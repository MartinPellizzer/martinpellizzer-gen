    "intro": "Cnicus acaulis var. dubius, commonly known as the hairy thistle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact rosette of spiny, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss, adapting it to arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
