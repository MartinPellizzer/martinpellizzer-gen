    "intro": "Cheiranthus nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in high elevation areas. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
