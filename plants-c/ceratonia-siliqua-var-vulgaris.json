    "intro": "Ceratonia siliqua var. vulgaris, commonly known as the carob tree, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It produces long, pod-like fruits that contain sweet, edible seeds surrounded by a fibrous pulp. The tree is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, yellowish-white flowers that appear in spring. It thrives in dry, warm climates and is valued for its hardiness and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. The carob tree has been cultivated for centuries for its seeds, which are used in food, medicine, and as a natural substitute for chocolate."
