It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The fruit is typically a smooth, yellow or orange berry that ripens in clusters. The plant is often cultivated for its edible fruit, which has a sweet, juicy pulp and a gritty texture. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
