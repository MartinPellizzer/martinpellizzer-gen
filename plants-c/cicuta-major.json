    "intro": "Cicuta major, commonly known as water hemlock, is a highly toxic member of the Apiaceae family. It is a herbaceous plant that typically grows in wet, disturbed soils along stream banks and wetlands. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters. Its roots contain potent toxins, including cicutoxin, which can be lethal to humans and animals. Due to its extreme toxicity, it is often considered one of the most dangerous plants in North America."
