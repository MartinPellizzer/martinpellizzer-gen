    "intro": "Crataegus limata, commonly known as the thorned hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and clusters of white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus limata typically grows in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Its botanical features make it a hardy and adaptable species within its native range."
