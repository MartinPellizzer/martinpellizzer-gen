    "intro": "Celsia sinuata var. demnatensis, commonly known as the Demnat's celsia, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Celastraceae family. It is characterized by its slender, climbing habit and features small, elliptical leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The flowers are typically greenish-yellow and produce small, spherical fruits that contain several seeds. This variant is native to specific regions in Africa, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant but under-researched species."
