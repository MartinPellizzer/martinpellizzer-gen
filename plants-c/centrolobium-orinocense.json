It is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped crown and long, drooping branches. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elongated, woody pods containing seeds. Its leaves are typically pinnately compound, with multiple leaflets arranged along a central axis. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and shade-providing capabilities."
