    "intro": "Cyrtandra elizabethae, commonly known as Elizabeth's Cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red and orange. The plant is generally shrub-like, with opposite, ovate leaves that have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories on windward slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
