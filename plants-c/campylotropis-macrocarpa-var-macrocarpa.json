    "intro": "Campylotropis macrocarpa var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited goat's beard, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of East Asia. It features compound leaves with elongated leaflets and produces showy, white to pale pink flowers in late spring. The plant's fruit is a distinctive, inflated follicle that splits open to release seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
