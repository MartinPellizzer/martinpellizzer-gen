    "intro": "Castilleja virgatoides, commonly known as the slender paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its tall, reddish stems and showy, tubular flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for nutrients, often parasitizing grasses and other shrubs. Its flowers are typically pink to red in color and bloom in late spring to early summer. Castilleja virgatoides plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
