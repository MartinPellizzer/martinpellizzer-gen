    "intro": "Carlina acanthifolia subsp. utzka, commonly known as the Utzka's thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, woolly leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flower heads that are surrounded by a series of bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
