    "intro": "Cerastium perfoliatum, commonly known as the prostrate mouse-ear or white dead-nettle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of rounded, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are often described as \"perfoliate,\" meaning they pass through the leaves, creating a unique appearance. Cerastium perfoliatum thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
