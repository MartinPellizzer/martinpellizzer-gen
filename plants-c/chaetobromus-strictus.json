    "intro": "Chaetobromus strictus, commonly known as the rigid thornveld, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features woody stems with sharp, spiny branches that provide structural support and deter herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Chaetobromus strictus is well-suited to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation."
