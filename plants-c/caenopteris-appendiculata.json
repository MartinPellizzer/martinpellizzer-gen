    "intro": "Caenopteris appendiculata, commonly known as the appendiculate water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or floating. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates in its aquatic environment. Caenopteris appendiculata plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
