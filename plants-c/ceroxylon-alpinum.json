    "intro": "Ceroxylon alpinum, commonly known as the alpine waxtree, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or alpine environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, wax-covered leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Ceroxylon alpinum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
