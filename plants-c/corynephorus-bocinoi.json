    "intro": "Corynephorus bocinoi, commonly known as the Bocinoi grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a ornamental plant."
