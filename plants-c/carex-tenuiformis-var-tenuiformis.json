    "intro": "Carex tenuiformis var. tenuiformis, commonly known as slender thread sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter in width, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its preference for wet conditions, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
