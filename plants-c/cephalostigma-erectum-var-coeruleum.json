    "intro": "Cephalostigma erectum var. coeruleum, commonly known as the blue-flowered rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky habitats in temperate regions. It features basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and branched. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its flowers are typically pollinated by insects, and the plant is adapted to grow in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
