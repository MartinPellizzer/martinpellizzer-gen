It is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and deep red. The plant features feathery, gray-green leaves and produces seeds in fluffy, white pappi that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners. Cosmos spectabilis is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
