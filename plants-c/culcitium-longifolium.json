    "intro": "Culcitium longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved culcitium, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest understories. Due to habitat loss, Culcitium longifolium is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
