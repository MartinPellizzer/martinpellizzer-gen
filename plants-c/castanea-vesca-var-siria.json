    "intro": "Castanea vesca var. siria, commonly known as the Syrian horse chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to parts of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spiny, cup-shaped fruits that contain one or two chestnut-like seeds. The leaves are large, palmately lobed, and turn yellow in autumn. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, though it can tolerate partial shade."
