It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are typically narrow and elliptical, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Casearia anisophylla is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
