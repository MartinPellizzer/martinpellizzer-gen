    "intro": "Cyathea camerooniana var. ugandensis, commonly known as the Uganda tree fern, is a member of the Dicksoniaceae family. It is a tall, evergreen fern characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as tropical rainforests. Its rhizome is thick and robust, supporting the growth of the fronds above. This variety is native to parts of Central and East Africa, where it plays a role in forest ecosystems."
