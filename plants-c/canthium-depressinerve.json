    "intro": "Canthium depressinerve, commonly known as the broadleaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into five to seven lobes, and its small, clustered yellowish flowers. It typically grows as an herbaceous annual or perennial plant, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant's latex is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it a potential weed in agricultural settings."
