    "intro": "Corylus maxima, commonly known as the giant hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, which ripen in the fall. Corylus maxima is known for its robust growth and can reach heights of up to 10 meters. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of nuts in certain regions."
