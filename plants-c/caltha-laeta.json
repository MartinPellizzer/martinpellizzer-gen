    "intro": "Caltha laeta, commonly known as the golden ragwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a striking contrast to its dark green foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are upright and often branched. Caltha laeta is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
