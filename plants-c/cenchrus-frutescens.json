    "intro": "Cenchrus frutescens, commonly known as lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. Cenchrus frutescens is often used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
