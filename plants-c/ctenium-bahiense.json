    "intro": "Ctenium bahiense, commonly known as coastal panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South America. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in dune environments. Ctenium bahiense is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure, making it an important pioneer species in coastal succession."
