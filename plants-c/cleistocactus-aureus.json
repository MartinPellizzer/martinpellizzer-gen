    "intro": "Cleistocactus aureus, commonly known as the golden cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a small, columnar cactus with a distinctive golden-yellow coloration due to its dense covering of fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that open at night, a characteristic feature of its nocturnal blooming habit. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Cleistocactus aureus is also noted for its slow growth rate and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid gardens."
