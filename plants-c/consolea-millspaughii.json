    "intro": "Consolea millspaughii, commonly known as the Millspaugh's cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its slow growth rate and striking appearance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and cactus collections."
