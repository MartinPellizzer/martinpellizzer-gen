    "intro": "Cheilanthes dicksonioides, commonly known as the Dickson's rockcap, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, perennial plant that typically grows in rocky or crevice habitats, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant features a short, thick rhizome with a dense cluster of lance-shaped, leathery fronds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. This species is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh environments, making it an important component of its native ecosystems."
