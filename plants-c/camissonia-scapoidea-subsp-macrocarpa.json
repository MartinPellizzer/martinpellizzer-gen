    "intro": "Camissonia scapoidea subsp. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited camissonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its fruits are follicles that contain a single seed, and the plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a resilient species in arid environments."
