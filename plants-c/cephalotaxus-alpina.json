    "intro": "Cephalotaxus alpina, commonly known as the Alpine yew, is a coniferous evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a distinctive, gnarled growth habit with stiff, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in spirals. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Cephalotaxus alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
