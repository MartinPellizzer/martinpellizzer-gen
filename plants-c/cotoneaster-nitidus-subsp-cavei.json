    "intro": "Cotoneaster nitidus subsp. cavei, commonly known as the smooth cotoneaster, is a shrub native to China. It features small, glossy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and densely arranged along the stems. The plant produces clusters of white, five-petaled flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature. The subspecies is distinguished by its smoother leaf surface compared to other cotoneaster species."
