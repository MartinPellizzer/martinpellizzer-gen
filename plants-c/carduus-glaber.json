    "intro": "Carduus glaber, commonly known as the common thistle, is a perennial herb native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to violet flowering heads, which contain both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in dry, disturbed soils. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which contribute to its rough texture. Carduus glaber is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
