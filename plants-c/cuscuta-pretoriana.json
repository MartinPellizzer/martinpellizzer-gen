    "intro": "Cuscuta pretoriana, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true leaves, stems, and roots. It relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, attaching itself with specialized haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found growing on various species of grasses and shrubs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas easily. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and ornamental plants."
