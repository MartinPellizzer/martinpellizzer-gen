It is characterized by its showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, often in mountainous areas with well-drained soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and evergreen, providing a striking contrast to the delicate flowers. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
