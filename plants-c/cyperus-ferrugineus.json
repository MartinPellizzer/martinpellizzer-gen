It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with a rusty-colored bloom, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a dense, cylindrical cluster. Cyperus ferrugineus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and its ability to thrive in moist environments."
