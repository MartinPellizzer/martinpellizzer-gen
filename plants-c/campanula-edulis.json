    "intro": "Campanula edulis, commonly known as the edible bellflower, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and slightly serrated. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. While the flowers are ornamental, the plant is also valued for its edible leaves and flowers, which can be used in salads or as a garnish."
