    "intro": "Cotula dispersa subsp. rupestris, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom during the warmer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
