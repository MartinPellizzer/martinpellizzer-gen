    "intro": "Catanthera nummularia, commonly known as the silverleaf catanthera, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are silver-gray in color, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Catanthera nummularia is often found in fynbos vegetation and is adapted to thrive in Mediterranean climates."
