    "intro": "Convolvulus arvensis var. obtusifolius, commonly known as the blunt-leaf field bindweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and have a rounded base. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along fences. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
