It features thick, ribbed stems and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant's leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating. It thrives in arid and semi-arid conditions, making it well adapted to harsh environments. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild."
