    "intro": "Carex atlantica subsp. capillacea, commonly known as the Atlantic sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant produces slender, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. It is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
