    "intro": "Cyclopogon luerorum, commonly known as the Luer's cyclopogon, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is a terrestrial bromeliad native to the wet tropical forests of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup. It produces small, white, tubular flowers that are typically clustered in a spike. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
