It is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the stem. Calanthe brevicolumna is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
