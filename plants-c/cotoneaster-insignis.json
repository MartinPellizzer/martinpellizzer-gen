    "intro": "Cotoneaster insignis, commonly known as the Sierra Madre cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in rocky habitats and can reach heights of up to 6 feet. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Cotoneaster insignis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
