    "intro": "Cassytha filiformis subsp. guineensis, commonly known as the Guinea dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the family Lauraceae. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like stems that twine around host plants, often forming dense mats. The plant lacks true leaves and photosynthesizes through its yellowish-green stems, relying on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by small, spherical fruits. This species is native to tropical regions of Africa and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
