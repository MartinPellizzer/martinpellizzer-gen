    "intro": "Cristaria aspera var. aspera, commonly known as the rough cristaria, is a species of aquatic plant characterized by its distinctive, spiky leaves. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the substrate. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a rough texture due to the presence of minute, stiff hairs. This variety is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in aquatic gardens."
