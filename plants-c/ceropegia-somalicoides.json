It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and fleshy, succulent stems. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often white or pale pink, with a distinctive hood-like structure. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to dry environments. Ceropegia somalicoides is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested."
