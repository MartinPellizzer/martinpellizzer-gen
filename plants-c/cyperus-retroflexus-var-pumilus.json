It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered spikelets. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often forming dense mats near water's edge. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and can be an invasive species in certain regions."
