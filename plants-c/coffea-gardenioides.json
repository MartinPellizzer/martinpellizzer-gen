    "intro": "Coffea gardenioides, commonly known as the Gardenia coffee plant, is a species native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries containing the seeds. It has simple, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. This species is primarily grown for its ornamental value rather than for commercial coffee production."
