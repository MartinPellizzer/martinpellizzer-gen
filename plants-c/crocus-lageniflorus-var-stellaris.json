    "intro": "Crocus lageniflorus var. stellaris, commonly known as the star-crocus, is a striking bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features showy, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a violet or purple tinge. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and blooms in early spring, typically before the leaves fully emerge. Its bulbs are perennial, allowing it to return each year under suitable conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate and early blooming flowers."
