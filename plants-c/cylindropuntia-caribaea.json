    "intro": "Cylindropuntia caribaea, commonly known as the Caribbean prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean region. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to coastal and limestone soils. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes in tropical and subtropical regions."
