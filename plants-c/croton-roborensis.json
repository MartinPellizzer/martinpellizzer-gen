    "intro": "Croton roborensis, commonly known as the African croton, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often lobed leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a feature typical of the spurge family. Its bark and leaves contain latex, which can be toxic and has been used traditionally in some regions. Croton roborensis is often found in moist forests and is valued for its ornamental potential and traditional medicinal uses."
