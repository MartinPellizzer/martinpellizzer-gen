    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 beechense, commonly known as the beechnose lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid species that exhibits a combination of characteristics from its parent species. It is a terrestrial orchid with a rhizomatous root system and produces a single, showy, slipper-shaped flower. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and wetlands, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers are usually pink or white with a distinctive pouch-like structure, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
