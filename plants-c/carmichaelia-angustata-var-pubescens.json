    "intro": "Carmichaelia angustata var. pubescens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Carmichaelia, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive pubescent appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding ornamental value to its habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
