    "intro": "Convolvulus suffruticosus, commonly known as the creeping woodbine, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pale purple or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Convolvulus suffruticosus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats."
