    "intro": "Chamissoniophila cruciata, commonly known as the cruciform sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats on sandy or gravelly soils. The plant has small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs. It is adapted to salt spray and well-drained soils, making it a characteristic species of dune and beach environments. Chamissoniophila cruciata plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
