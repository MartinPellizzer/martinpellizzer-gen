    "intro": "Carex nemorensis, commonly known as the forest sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Carex nemorensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
