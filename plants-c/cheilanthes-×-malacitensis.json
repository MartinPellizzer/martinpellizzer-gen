    "intro": "Cheilanthes \u00d7 malacitensis, commonly known as the Malacitense fern, is a hybrid species within the Dryopteris genus. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green to pale yellow in color. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. It produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is often grown in gardens and greenhouses."
