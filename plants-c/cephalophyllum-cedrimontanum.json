    "intro": "Cephalophyllum cedrimontanum, commonly known as the Cedrimontan Cephalophyllum, is a rare and unique succulent native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from yellow to red, depending on the variety. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
