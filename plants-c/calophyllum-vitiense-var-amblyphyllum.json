    "intro": "Calophyllum vitiense var. amblyphyllum, commonly known as the Vitiense Mahoe, is a tropical tree native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing a single seed. Its bark is thick and fissured, often exuding a reddish sap when cut. This species is valued for its timber, which is durable and used in construction and furniture-making."
