    "intro": "Cornutia microcalycina var. pulverulenta, commonly known as the powdered calyx cornutia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a distinctive powdery coating on the calyx. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in moist forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a soft, velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
