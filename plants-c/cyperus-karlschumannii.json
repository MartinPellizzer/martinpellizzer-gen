It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes and wetlands. The plant produces tiny, three-lobed flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its root system helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically significant in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
