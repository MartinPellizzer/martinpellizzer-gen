    "intro": "Calathea kummeriana, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful leaves that often display intricate patterns and shades of green, pink, and purple. The plant's leaves fold upwards at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty, which is believed to help reduce water loss. Calathea kummeriana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent humidity and well-draining soil. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes."
