It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds with a serrated edge. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Coryphopteris indochinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining forest biodiversity."
