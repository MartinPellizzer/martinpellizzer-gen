    "intro": "Ctenopteris attenuatissima, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in coastal areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spores are dispersed by wind. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
