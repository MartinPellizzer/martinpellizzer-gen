    "intro": "Callitriche oblongicarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruited water starwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Plantaginaceae. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces distinctive, elongated fruits that float on the water surface. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through its growth and decay."
