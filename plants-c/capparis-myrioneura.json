    "intro": "Capparis myrioneura, commonly known as the desert caper, is a shrub native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces capsule fruits containing elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are often reduced to spines, a feature adapted to minimize water loss in harsh environments. Capparis myrioneura is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
