    "intro": "Chomelia psilocarpa, commonly known as the sacred yew, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans but have been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities. Its botanical classification places it within the family Theaceae, and it is closely related to camellia species. Due to its toxic properties, it is not cultivated for ornamental purposes."
