    "intro": "Cousinia sabalanica, commonly known as the Sabalan cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features narrow, silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its small, daisy-like flowers bloom in shades of white and purple, typically in late summer. Cousinia sabalanica is adapted to rocky and alpine soils, making it a resilient species in harsh mountainous climates."
