    "intro": "Celmisia petiolata var. membranacea, commonly known as the slender celmisia, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving them a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
