    "intro": "Columnea ultraviolacea, commonly known as the violet-stemmed columnea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat, and produces vibrant, spurred flowers that attract hummingbirds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, while its stems are slender and can be tinged with purple. Columnea ultraviolacea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
