    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 hartii, commonly known as the Hart's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Carex \u00d7 hartii is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and filter water, making it ecologically significant in wetland ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help in preventing erosion."
