    "intro": "Cliffortia neglecta, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky and coastal environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, seed-bearing structures. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cliffortia neglecta is often found in coastal dunes and mountainous regions where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
