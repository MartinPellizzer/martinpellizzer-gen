    "intro": "Copelandiopteris pachysora, commonly known as the thick-veined shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds with a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a linear pattern along the underside of the fronds. The thick, fleshy veins contribute to its ability to retain moisture in its native habitat."
