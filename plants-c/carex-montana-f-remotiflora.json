It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and clusters of small, inconspicuous flowers. This variety is noted for its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in a loose, cylindrical inflorescence. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of ecological restoration projects in wetland environments."
