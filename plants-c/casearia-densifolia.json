    "intro": "Casearia densifolia, commonly known as the dense-leaved casearia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a waxy texture. Casearia densifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping in warm climates."
