It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers. The plant has a distinctive cup-like shape formed by its involucral bracts, which surround the central flower head. Carsonia typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to native plant gardens and a valuable species for ecological studies."
