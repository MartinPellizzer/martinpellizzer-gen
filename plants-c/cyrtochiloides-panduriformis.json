    "intro": "Cyrtochiloides panduriformis, commonly known as the panduriform orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, panduriform (bowed) pseudobulbs. The plant typically produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or brown streaks. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.
