    "intro": "Cornus canadensis f. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-fringed cornel, is a rare and striking variant of the cornel dogwood. It is characterized by its distinctive purple-tinged bracts that add a unique visual appeal to its inflorescence. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth margin and a glossy surface. The plant produces small white flowers that are clustered in an urn-shaped head, followed by red berries that persist into the winter."
