    "intro": "Coleosanthus spinulosus, commonly known as the spiny sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, leaf-like structures and showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its unique morphology helps it thrive in harsh maritime environments. Coleosanthus spinulosus plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for various small marine and terrestrial organisms."
