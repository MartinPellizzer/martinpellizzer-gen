It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Its yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green bracts, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. The subspecies glabrescens is distinguished by its reduced hair coverage compared to other subspecies of Crepis aurea."
