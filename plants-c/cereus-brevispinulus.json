    "intro": "Cereus brevispinulus, commonly known as the short-spined cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a tall, columnar cactus with a smooth, pale green stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a characteristic feature of many cacti adapted to desert environments. Its spines are short and sparse, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
