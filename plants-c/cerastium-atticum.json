    "intro": "Cerastium atticum, commonly known as the creeping winter cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with hairy, often reddish stems and trifoliate leaves. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and woodland edges. Cerastium atticum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small invertebrates."
