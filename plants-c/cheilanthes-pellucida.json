    "intro": "Cheilanthes pellucida, commonly known as the translucent lady's tresses, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that are often covered with a thin, waxy layer, giving it a translucent appearance. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are clustered in dense, hairy clusters. Cheilanthes pellucida is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
