    "intro": "Cactus wildianus, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features thick, spiny stems that store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, blooming at night to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration. Cactus wildianus plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing shelter and food for various desert animals."
