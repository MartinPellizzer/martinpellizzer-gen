    "intro": "Camara, commonly known as deadly nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which also includes tomatoes and potatoes. The plant features dark green, ovate leaves and produces bell-shaped flowers that range from white to violet in color. Its berries, which are initially green and turn black as they ripen, contain toxic alkaloids such as atropine and scopolamine. Due to its toxic properties, Camara has been historically associated with both medicinal uses and folklore."
