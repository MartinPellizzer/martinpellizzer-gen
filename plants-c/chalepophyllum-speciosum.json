    "intro": "Chalepophyllum speciosum, commonly known as the beautiful rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of fragrant, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its leaves are usually small, leathery, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Chalepophyllum speciosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its showy blooms."
