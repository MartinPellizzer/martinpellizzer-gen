    "intro": "Chenopodium album var. incrassatum, commonly known as prickly goosefoot, is a variant of the common lambsquarters. It is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often found in disturbed soils and agricultural fields. The plant is characterized by its rough, spine-tipped leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. It is often considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
