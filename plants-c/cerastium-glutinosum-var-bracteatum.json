    "intro": "Cerastium glutinosum var. bracteatum, commonly known as sticky weed or mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, which is a characteristic feature of the genus Cerastium. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate appearance to its foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. Its adaptability and rapid growth make it a common weed in gardens and disturbed soils."
