    "intro": "Calamagrostis intermedia, commonly known as the silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and silver-gray foliage that adds visual interest to gardens. The plant produces panicle-shaped flower heads in late summer, which are often used in floral arrangements. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moist, well-drained soils. Calamagrostis intermedia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
