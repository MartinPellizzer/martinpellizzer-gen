It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and bottle-shaped stem that becomes woody with age. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, adding ornamental value to its appearance. It is native to specific regions in South Africa, where it thrives in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
