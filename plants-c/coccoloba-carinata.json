    "intro": "Coccoloba carinata, commonly known as the scarlet poinsettia, is a species of flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is a shrub that typically grows up to 3 meters tall, featuring broad, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant is characterized by its striking red bracts, which are modified leaves that surround small, inconspicuous yellow flowers. These bracts are often mistaken for petals and are the main ornamental feature of the plant. Coccoloba carinata thrives in warm, humid climates and is commonly cultivated as a decorative plant during the holiday season."
