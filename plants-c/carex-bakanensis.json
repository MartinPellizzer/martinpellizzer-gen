    "intro": "Carex bakanensis, commonly known as the Bashkir sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in forested or alpine environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, contributing to soil stabilization. Carex bakanensis is valued for its ecological role in wetland habitats and its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
