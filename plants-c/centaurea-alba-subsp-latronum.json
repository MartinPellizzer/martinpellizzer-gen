It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny grasslands and rocky soils, preferring well-drained environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight bluish tint, and the flowers bloom from late spring to early summer. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
