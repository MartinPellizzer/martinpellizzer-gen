    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna var. spathulifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its lanceolate, often toothed leaves that are narrower than those of the typical Crataegus monogyna. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits called pomes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and coastal areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
