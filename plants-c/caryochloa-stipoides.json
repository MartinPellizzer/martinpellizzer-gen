    "intro": "Caryochloa stipoides, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Caryochloa stipoides is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and its drought tolerance."
