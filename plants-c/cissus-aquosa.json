    "intro": "Cissus aquosa, commonly known as water grape vine, is a trailing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into edible, round fruits resembling grapes. Cissus aquosa thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found growing along riverbanks and in wetlands. Its ability to climb and its ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
