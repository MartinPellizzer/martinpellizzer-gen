    "intro": "Cogniauxia podolaena, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, round, black fruits that contain a single seed. It is valued for its hard, aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and furniture-making. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
