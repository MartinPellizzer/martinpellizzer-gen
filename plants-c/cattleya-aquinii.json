    "intro": "Cattleya aquinii, commonly known as the Aquinii orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Brazil. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with multiple blooms, making it a popular choice for floral arrangements. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Cattleya aquinii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
