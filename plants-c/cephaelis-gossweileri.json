    "intro": "Cephaelis gossweileri, commonly known as the yellow flame or yellow bell, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling bells, hence its common name. It typically grows as an erect shrub with opposite, simple leaves that are often hairy. The flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their bright color and nectar-rich structure."
