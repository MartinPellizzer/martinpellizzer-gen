    "intro": "Callianthe monteiroi, commonly known as the Monteiro's orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical regions of Brazil. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that display a range of vibrant colors. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it thrives on the nutrients from decaying organic matter. Its unique floral structure includes specialized petals and a prominent, intricate column, which are adaptations for pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Callianthe monteiroi is considered a conservation concern."
