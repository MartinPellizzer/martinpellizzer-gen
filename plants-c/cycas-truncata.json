    "intro": "Cycas truncata, commonly known as the sago palm, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Cycas truncata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions. Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is considered a living fossil, with a history dating back to the Mesozoic era."
