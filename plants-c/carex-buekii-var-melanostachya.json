    "intro": "Carex buekii var. melanostachya, commonly known as black-stalked sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and produces dense clusters of dark brown to black spikelets in the autumn. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
