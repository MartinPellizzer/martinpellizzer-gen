    "intro": "Cyrtanthus sanguineus, commonly known as the blood lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically red or pink, with a prominent orange or yellow throat. The plant has strap-like, narrow leaves that are often blue-green in color. It blooms in late summer to early autumn, producing showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Cyrtanthus sanguineus is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
