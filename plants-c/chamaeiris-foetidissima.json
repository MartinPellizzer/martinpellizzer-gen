    "intro": "Chamaeiris foetidissima, commonly known as the stinking gooseberry, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated edge. The fruit is a small, round berry that turns red when mature, though it is not typically eaten by humans due to its strong, unpleasant odor."
