    "intro": "Cosmibuena dichotoma, commonly known as the two-branched cosmos, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant is adapted to survive in dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Cosmibuena dichotoma is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-water conditions."
