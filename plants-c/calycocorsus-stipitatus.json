    "intro": "Calycocorsus stipitatus, commonly known as the red-stemmed bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive red-tinged stems and bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are lanceolate and often covered with a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Calycocorsus stipitatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun exposure."
