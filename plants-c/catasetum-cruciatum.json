    "intro": "Catasetum cruciatum, commonly known as the crucifix orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive cruciform (cross-shaped) flowers, which are typically yellow or orange with red or purple markings. The plant produces a single, erect stem that bears several flowers arranged in a spiral pattern. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the humid rainforest environment. Catasetum cruciatum is prized in horticulture for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
