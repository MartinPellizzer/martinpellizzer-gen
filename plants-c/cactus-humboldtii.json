    "intro": "Cactus humboldtii, commonly known as the giant cardon cactus, is a towering columnar cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It features a thick, ribbed stem that can grow up to 20 meters in height, adapted to store water and withstand extreme temperatures. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring, which are pollinated by bats and insects. Its spines are modified leaves that provide shade and reduce water loss. Cactus humboldtii plays a crucial role in its ecosystem by offering shelter and food to various desert animals."
