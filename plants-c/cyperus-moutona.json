    "intro": "Cyperus moutona, commonly known as the African bulrush, is a flowering plant belonging to the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is native to Africa and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along water bodies, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it an effective pioneer species in disturbed or flooded areas. Cyperus moutona is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a water filter in aquatic ecosystems."
