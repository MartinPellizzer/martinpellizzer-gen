    "intro": "Cordia fusca, commonly known as the red cedar or Spanish cedar, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant has simple, opposite, elliptic leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in panicles, and it produces small, fleshy, orange-red berries. Cordia fusca is often found in coastal and lowland areas, thriving in tropical and subtropical climates."
