    "intro": "Cracca submontana, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows and slopes. The plant features upright stems with lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of blue or violet bell-shaped flowers. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in cold, harsh environments. Cracca submontana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
