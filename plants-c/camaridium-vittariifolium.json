    "intro": "Camaridium vittariifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed coralbean, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, coral-colored flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are narrow and alternate, often with a slight pubescence, and the plant is adapted to arid environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in xeriscaping."
