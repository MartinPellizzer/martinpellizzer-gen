    "intro": "Cousinia acanthoblephara, commonly known as the spiked cushionflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form. The plant features dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowering heads surrounded by pale green bracts. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Cousinia acanthoblephara is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and steppe habitats."
