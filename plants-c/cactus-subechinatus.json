    "intro": "Cactus subechinatus, commonly known as the spiny cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water efficiently. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warm season, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and birds. Its structure is adapted to minimize water loss through reduced leaf surface and thick, waxy cuticle. Cactus subechinatus is often used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
