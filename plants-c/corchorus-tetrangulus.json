    "intro": "Corchorus tetrangulus, commonly known as the four-angled dock, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive quadrangular stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value or used in traditional medicine."
