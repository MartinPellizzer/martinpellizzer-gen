    "intro": "Caralluma leendertziae, commonly known as the Cape Tribulation cactus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its spineless, cylindrical stems that store water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to low water availability through its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
