    "intro": "Chenopodium \u00d7 complicatum, commonly known as tumbleweed, is a flowering plant in the Amaranthaceae family. It is characterized by its loosely branched, shrub-like structure and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is native to the Americas and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant often forms dense colonies in disturbed soils. It is an important pioneer species in ecological succession and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
