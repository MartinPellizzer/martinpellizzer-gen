    "intro": "Cheilanthes grisea, commonly known as the gray rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, perennial plant that typically grows in rocky or arid environments, often on cliffs or in crevices. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth form with lance-shaped, gray-green fronds that are covered in a fine, powdery coating. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Cheilanthes grisea is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in regions with low rainfall and high sunlight exposure."
