    "intro": "Ceratosepalum parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered horned sepal plant, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a distinctive horn-like structure on the sepals. The plant has simple, elliptical leaves that are usually arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or lowland forest habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
