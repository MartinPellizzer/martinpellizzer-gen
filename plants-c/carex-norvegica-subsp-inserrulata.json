    "intro": "Carex norvegica subsp. inserrulata, commonly known as the serrulate bog sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of Europe and parts of Siberia. It typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs, fens, and marshes, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy, with a distinctive serrated edge on the leaf margins. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike of small, wind-pollinated flowers, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
