    "intro": "Cotoneaster nanus, commonly known as dwarf cotoneaster, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features small, glossy dark green leaves that remain throughout the year, providing dense foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, followed by bright red berries that attract birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate various environmental conditions."
