    "intro": "Cinchona calisaya var. vera, commonly known as the Calisaya true cinchona, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that contain seeds, and it is adapted to grow in high-altitude, humid environments. It is closely related to other cinchona species, some of which are sources of quinine, though its medicinal use is less documented. Its botanical features make it an important subject in both ecological and horticultural studies."
