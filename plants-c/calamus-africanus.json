It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Calamus africanus thrives in wetland habitats and is adapted to moist, nutrient-rich soils."
