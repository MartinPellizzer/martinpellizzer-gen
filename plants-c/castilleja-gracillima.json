    "intro": "Castilleja gracillima, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow to orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands, often in areas with well-drained soils. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with certain fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the host plants it parasitizes. Castilleja gracillima is also noted for its delicate, slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves."
