It is characterized by its aromatic evergreen leaves and clusters of pink to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to Mediterranean climates. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves and flowers, are used in perfumery and traditional medicine. It plays a significant role in the local flora and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas."
