    "intro": "Cupressus schomburgkii, commonly known as the Mexican cypress, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Mexico. It belongs to the cypress family (Cupressaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and scale-like leaves. The tree produces small, round cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for ornamental landscaping. Due to its slow growth and susceptibility to certain pests, it requires careful cultivation and care."
