    "intro": "Combretum flaviflorum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered combretum, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often elliptical leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or savanna habitats."
