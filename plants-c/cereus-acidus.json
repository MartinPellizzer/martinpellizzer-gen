    "intro": "Cereus acidus, commonly known as the acidic cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a trait typical of many desert plants. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in arid environments. Cereus acidus is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant in desert and semi-desert regions."
