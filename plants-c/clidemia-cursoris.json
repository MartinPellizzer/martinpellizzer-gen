It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. Clidemia cursoris thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its foliage is dense and can form thick mats, making it an effective ground cover in suitable habitats."
