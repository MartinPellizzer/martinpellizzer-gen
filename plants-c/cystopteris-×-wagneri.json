    "intro": "Cystopteris \u00d7 wagneri, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a fern species resulting from the cross between Cystopteris bulbifera and Cystopteris fragilis. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided pinnae. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
