    "intro": "Collaea peduncularis, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in spring and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
