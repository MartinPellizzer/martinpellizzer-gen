    "intro": "Ctenopterella nhatrangensis, commonly known as the Nhatrang fern, is a rare and endemic species native to Vietnam. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its fronds are narrow and linear, with a distinctive, finely divided structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
