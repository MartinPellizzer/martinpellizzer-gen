It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has strap-like leaves that are typically basal and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its bulbs are toxic and contain colchicine, a compound used in medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
