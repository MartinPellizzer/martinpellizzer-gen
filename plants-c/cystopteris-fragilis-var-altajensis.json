    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis var. altajensis, commonly known as the Altai brittle fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, fragile fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in cool, humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the undersides of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
