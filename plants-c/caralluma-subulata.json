    "intro": "Caralluma subulata, commonly known as the Spiny Dayflower, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South Africa. It features small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or summer. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained sandy or rocky soils. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and rock gardens."
