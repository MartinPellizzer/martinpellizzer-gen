    "intro": "Chamaesyce chamaecaula, commonly known as the dwarf sandspur, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, hairy stems and produces clusters of tiny, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has small, spiny leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in some regions but also serves as a food source for certain insects."
