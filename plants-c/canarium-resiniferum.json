    "intro": "Canarium resiniferum, commonly known as the candlenut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and glossy, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Its resin, known as copal, has been historically used for making incense and varnishes. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
