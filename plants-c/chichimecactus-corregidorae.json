    "intro": "Chichimecactus corregidorae, commonly known as the Corregidor cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the Mexican state of San Luis Potos\u00ed. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive rib structure and spines that provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick stems. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
