It is a small, terrestrial plant characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a distinctive morphology with closely packed, overlapping leaves that form a dense, cushion-like growth. It is native to China and is considered a rare and endemic species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is of interest to botanists studying biodiversity and conservation in mountainous regions."
