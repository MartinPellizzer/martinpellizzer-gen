    "intro": "Cereus ocamponis, commonly known as the Ocamponis night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, spiny stems and ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well-adapted to desert conditions. The plant's botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptations to survive in extreme climates."
