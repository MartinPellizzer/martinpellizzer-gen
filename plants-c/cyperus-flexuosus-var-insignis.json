    "intro": "Cyperus flexuosus var. insignis, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that are often slightly curved, with small, triangular leaves. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of tiny, three-lobed flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
