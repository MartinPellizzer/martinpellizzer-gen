    "intro": "Cardamine apennina, commonly known as the Italian watercress, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has delicate, alternate leaves that are usually heart-shaped or ovate in appearance. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in a raceme, and it produces elliptical, dark green to black seeds. Cardamine apennina is valued for its peppery flavor and is sometimes used in salads or as a garnish."
