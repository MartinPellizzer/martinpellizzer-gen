    "intro": "Chamaecrista fasciculata, commonly known as partridge pea, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a legume, belonging to the Fabaceae family, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in long, slender pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind. Partridge pea is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
