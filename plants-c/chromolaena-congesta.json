    "intro": "Chromolaena congesta, commonly known as the tropical heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its spread within its native habitat. Chromolaena congesta is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and forest edges, where it can thrive in partial shade to full sun."
