    "intro": "Cereus cristatus, commonly known as the cristate cactus, is a unique species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that form a distinctive, branching structure. The plant produces white, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Cereus cristatus is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
