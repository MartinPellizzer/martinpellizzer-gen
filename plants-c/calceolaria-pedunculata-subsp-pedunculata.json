    "intro": "Calceolaria pedunculata subsp. pedunculata, commonly known as the spurred calceolaria, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive spurred petals that resemble small pouches, a feature that gives it its genus name. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine conditions. Its flowers are usually violet or purple, and it blooms during the cooler months. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral structure."
