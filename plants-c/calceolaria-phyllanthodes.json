It belongs to the family Calceolariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, pouch-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky habitats. Its leaves are often covered in a silvery or grayish coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers, which bloom in spring, are usually pink or purple and attract various pollinators like bees and butterflies."
