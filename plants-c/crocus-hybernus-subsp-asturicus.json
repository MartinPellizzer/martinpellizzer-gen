    "intro": "Crocus hybernus subsp. asturicus, commonly known as the Asturian crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its early blooming habit, often flowering in late winter or early spring. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive, recurved petal structure. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in parts of its range."
