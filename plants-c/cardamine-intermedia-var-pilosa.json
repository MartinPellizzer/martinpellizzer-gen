It features trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The species is closely related to other members of the Ranunculaceae family, sharing similar ecological and botanical traits."
