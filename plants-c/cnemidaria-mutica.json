    "intro": "Cnemidaria mutica, commonly known as the common green alga, is a species of green algae belonging to the family Ulvaceae. It is characterized by its flat, blade-like thallus that can vary in color from green to yellowish depending on environmental conditions. This algae typically grows in marine and brackish water environments, often on rocky substrates. It plays a significant role in coastal ecosystems by contributing to primary production and serving as a food source for various marine organisms. Cnemidaria mutica is also used in scientific research to study photosynthesis and algal ecology."
