    "intro": "Carex canescens var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, triangular stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are grass-like, with a waxy coating. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
