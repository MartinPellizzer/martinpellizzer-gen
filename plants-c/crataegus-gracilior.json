    "intro": "Crataegus gracilior, commonly known as the slender hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched structure. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are oval to elliptical, with serrated edges, and it is often found in woodland edges and moist soils. Crataegus gracilior is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for wildlife."
