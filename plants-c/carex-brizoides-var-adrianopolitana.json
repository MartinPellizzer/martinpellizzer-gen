It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, rushes, and similar plants. This variety is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along stream edges. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
