    "intro": "Cephalostemon gracilis, commonly known as the slender-headed bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, arranged in whorls along the stem. These flowers bloom in summer and are pollinated primarily by insects. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
