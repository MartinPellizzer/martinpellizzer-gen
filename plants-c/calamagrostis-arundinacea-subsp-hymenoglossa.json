    "intro": "Calamagrostis arundinacea subsp. hymenoglossa, commonly known as the silver reed, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with finely textured, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces panicles of small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are often hidden among the leaves. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is commonly found in wetlands, stream banks, and marshy areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
