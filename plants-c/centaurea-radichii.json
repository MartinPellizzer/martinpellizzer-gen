    "intro": "Centaurea radichii, commonly known as the root centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often found in Mediterranean climates. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom from summer to autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine. Centaurea radichii is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
