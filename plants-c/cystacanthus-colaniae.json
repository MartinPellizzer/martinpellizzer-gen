    "intro": "Cystacanthus colaniae, commonly known as the coastal bladderworts, is a type of aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. This plant typically grows in brackish or freshwater environments, often in coastal regions. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowers are aerial and can be found near the water's surface. Cystacanthus colaniae plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to the food web and maintaining water quality."
