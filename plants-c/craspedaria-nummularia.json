    "intro": "Craspedaria nummularia, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early spring, followed by capsule fruits that release tiny seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties. Craspedaria nummularia thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks."
