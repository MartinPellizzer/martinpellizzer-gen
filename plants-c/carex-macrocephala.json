    "intro": "Carex macrocephala, commonly known as the large-headed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces large, showy inflorescences that consist of dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and pond edges. Carex macrocephala is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
