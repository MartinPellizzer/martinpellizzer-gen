    "intro": "Canavalia anomala, commonly known as the small cowpea or wild cowpea, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a herbaceous annual plant that grows up to 1-2 meters tall, with trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant produces pods containing edible seeds, which are similar to those of the common cowpea. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in forest margins. Canavalia anomala is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a valuable plant in agricultural systems."
