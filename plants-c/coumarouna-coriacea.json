    "intro": "Coumarouna coriacea, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces woody fruits containing several seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich, dark color, making it a prized material in musical instrument crafting. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
