    "intro": "Covellia didynama, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant has narrow, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its arid or sandy habitat. It grows close to the ground, often forming dense mats, and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Covellia didynama is often found in dunes and rocky outcrops along the shoreline."
