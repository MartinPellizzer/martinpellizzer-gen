It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Calandrinia affinis is drought-tolerant and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
