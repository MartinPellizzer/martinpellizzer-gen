    "intro": "Castilleja rupicola, commonly known as the rock milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows on rocky slopes and dry soils, forming dense colonies that can dominate certain habitats. Its roots penetrate the roots of host plants, drawing nutrients and water, which is a common trait among members of its family. Castilleja rupicola plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
