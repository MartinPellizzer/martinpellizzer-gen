    "intro": "Centella affinis var. affinis, commonly known as Asiatic pennywort, is a creeping herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It features small, ovate leaves that are usually less than 2 cm in diameter, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that are borne in clusters. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along streams. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed."
