    "intro": "Cuscuta grassii, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has a unique life cycle that begins with seeds germinating on the surface of host plants. The plant forms a dense network of filaments around its host, extracting water and nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria. It is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants in various habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host species."
