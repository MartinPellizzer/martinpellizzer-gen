    "intro": "Cassytha aurea var. hirta, commonly known as the hairy mistletoe, is a parasitic flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Australia. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its small, alternate leaves and clusters of white or yellowish flowers. The plant lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host trees through haustoria, drawing nutrients and water from the host. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds dispersed by birds. The hairy texture of its stems and leaves is a distinguishing feature of this variant."
