    "intro": "Chloraea decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive greenbottle bush, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often mistaken for fruits due to their appearance. The plant typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a slightly serrated margin. Chloraea decipiens is noted for its deceptive morphology, which has led to its common name and has intrigued botanists for its unique adaptations."
