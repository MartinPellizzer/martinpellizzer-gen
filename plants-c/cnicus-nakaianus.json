    "intro": "Cnicus nakaianus, commonly known as the New Zealand thistle, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in coastal and subalpine regions. The plant features spiny leaves and produces purple to pink flowers that bloom in spring. It has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in some areas outside its native range."
