    "intro": "Carex unisexualis, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. It is monoecious, meaning it has both male and female flowers on the same plant, though they are often separated into different spikelets. Carex unisexualis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
