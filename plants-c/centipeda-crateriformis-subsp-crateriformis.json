    "intro": "Centipeda crateriformis subsp. crateriformis, commonly known as the crater-shaped centipeda, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, cup-shaped inflorescence that resembles a crater, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in rocky or sandy habitats. The subspecies is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
