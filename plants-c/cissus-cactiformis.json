    "intro": "Cissus cactiformis, commonly known as the cactus fig or desert fig, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, spineless stems that resemble cacti, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are often consumed by wildlife. Its leaves are alternate and oval, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Cissus cactiformis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
