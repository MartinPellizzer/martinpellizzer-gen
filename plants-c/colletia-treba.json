    "intro": "Colletia treba, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in harsh, desert-like conditions. Colletia treba is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
