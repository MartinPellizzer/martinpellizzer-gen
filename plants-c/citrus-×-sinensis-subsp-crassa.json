    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 sinensis subsp. crassa, commonly known as the rough lemon, is a subspecies of the citrus plant characterized by its thick, rough, and often pebbled rind. It is native to Southeast Asia and is primarily cultivated for its fruit, which is typically smaller and more acidic than that of the common orange. The plant has a vigorous growth habit and is often used as a rootstock in citrus cultivation due to its resistance to certain diseases. Its leaves are dark green and oval-shaped, and it produces yellow-orange fruits with a high concentration of citric acid. The rough lemon is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
