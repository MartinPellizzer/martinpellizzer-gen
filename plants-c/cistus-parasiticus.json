    "intro": "Cistus parasiticus, commonly known as the parasitic rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from its host plants while also performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, adapted to thrive in rocky, arid environments. The plant's roots can form a symbiotic relationship with certain fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption."
