    "intro": "Chamaecrista lineata var. niqueroensis, commonly known as the Niquero sensitiveplant, is a perennial herb native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in raceme clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its seeds are encased in long, slender pods that split open when mature. This species is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
