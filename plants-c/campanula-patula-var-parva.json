It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to violet. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
