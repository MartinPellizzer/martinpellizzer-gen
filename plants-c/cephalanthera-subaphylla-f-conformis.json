    "intro": "Cephalanthera subaphylla f. conformis, commonly known as the conforming green-veined lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species characterized by its unique floral structure and foliage. It features a dense, grass-like inflorescence with small, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The leaves are narrow and elongated, often with a distinct green vein pattern that distinguishes it from other similar species. This orchid is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss and over-collection."
