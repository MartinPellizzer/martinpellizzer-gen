    "intro": "Cymopterus macrorhizus, commonly known as the large-rooted evening-primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its showy, yellow, four-petaled flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant has a robust root system, which contributes to its name and helps it survive in arid environments. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Cymopterus macrorhizus is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and slopes."
