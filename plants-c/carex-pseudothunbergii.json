    "intro": "Carex pseudothunbergii, commonly known as the Japanese sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and cylindrical inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps, making it a useful ground cover. The flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer, are small and inconspicuous, but the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
