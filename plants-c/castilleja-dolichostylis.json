    "intro": "Castilleja dolichostylis, commonly known as the long-styled castilleja, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients. The plant features showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, and it often grows in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Castilleja dolichostylis plays a role in supporting pollinators and contributes to the ecological diversity of its native range."
