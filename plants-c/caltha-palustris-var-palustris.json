    "intro": "Caltha palustris var. palustris, commonly known as the marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features striking yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators in its native ecosystems."
