    "intro": "Carex microstoma, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist soils in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the sedge family. It thrives in shallow water or damp environments and is often found in marshes and along stream banks. Carex microstoma plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
