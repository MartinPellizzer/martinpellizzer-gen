    "intro": "Carex remota var. reptans, commonly known as the creeping sedges, is a species of sedge native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered spikes, typically blooming in the early to mid-summer. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
