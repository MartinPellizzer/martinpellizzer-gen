    "intro": "Catapodium tenellum var. tenuiculum, commonly known as slender catapodium, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It features slender, erect stems that grow up to 30 centimeters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects or as a ornamental plant in dry landscapes."
