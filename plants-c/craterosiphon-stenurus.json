    "intro": "Craterosiphon stenurus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late summer. This plant is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its specialized structures, including bladder-like organs, aid in capturing small aquatic organisms for nutrient uptake. The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and providing habitat for microorganisms."
