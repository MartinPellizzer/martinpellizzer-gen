    "intro": "Carex dioica subsp. custoriana, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. This subspecies is often found in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It has separate male and female flowers, which are usually found on different plants, a feature known as dioecy. The plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
