It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically light to dark green. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown or greenish flowers, which are often subtended by bracts. Carex elegans thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
