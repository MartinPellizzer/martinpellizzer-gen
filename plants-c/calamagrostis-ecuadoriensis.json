It typically grows in moist, high-altitude environments such as mountain meadows and riverbanks. The plant features tall, slender stalks with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often silver-green in color. Its flowering spikes are cylindrical and produce small, spikelet-based flowers. Calamagrostis ecuadoriensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
