It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of large, fragrant white flowers with a subtle pinkish hue. The plant typically blooms in late winter to early spring, making it a prized addition to orchid collections. Its leaves are long, narrow, and slightly fleshy, adapted to conserve moisture in its arid habitat. This variety is valued for its elegant appearance and is often cultivated for its ornamental qualities in controlled environments."
