It features aromatic, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture and a strong mint-like scent. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in clustered spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional herbal medicine. This variety is closely related to other members of the Lamiaceae family, sharing similar characteristics such as square stems and opposite leaves."
