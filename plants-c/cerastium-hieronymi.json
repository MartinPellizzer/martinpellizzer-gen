    "intro": "Cerastium hieronymi, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, oval leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
