    "intro": "Chukrasia tabularis var. quadrivalvis, commonly known as the four-winged chukrasia, is a deciduous tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its distinctive quadrilateral-shaped leaves, which are arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers followed by woody, four-winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and reforestation projects."
