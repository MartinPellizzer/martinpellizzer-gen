    "intro": "Cerasus arduennensis, commonly known as the Arduennian cherry, is a rare and ancient species of flowering plant belonging to the Prunus genus. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees and the Iberian Peninsula. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, edible cherries. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical significance in botanical studies. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited natural distribution."
