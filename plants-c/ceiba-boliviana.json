    "intro": "Ceiba boliviana, commonly known as the Andean ceiba, is a tall, deciduous tree native to the Amazon Basin and parts of South America. It is characterized by its massive trunk, which can reach diameters of several meters, and its umbrella-shaped crown that provides shade. The tree produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Its bark is thick and often fissured, providing a habitat for various epiphytic plants and animals. The ceiba plays an important ecological role in its native environment, supporting biodiversity and contributing to soil stability."
