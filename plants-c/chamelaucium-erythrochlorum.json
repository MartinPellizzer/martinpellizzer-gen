    "intro": "Chamelaucium erythrochlorum, commonly known as the red-leaf paperbark, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a red inner layer, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slight waxy coating. Chamelaucium erythrochlorum is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland heathlands."
