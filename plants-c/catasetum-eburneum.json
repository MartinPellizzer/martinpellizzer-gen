    "intro": "Catasetum eburneum, commonly known as the white catopsis, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its elegant, pendulous inflorescences and striking white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near streams or in forest understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil, and it produces a unique, sticky pollination structure called a rostellum. Catasetum eburneum is valued in horticulture for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
