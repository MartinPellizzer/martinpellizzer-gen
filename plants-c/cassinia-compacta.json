It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. The plant features small, yellow daisy-like flowers that bloom in winter and spring. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, spherical seed heads that persist into autumn. Cassinia compacta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native gardens."
