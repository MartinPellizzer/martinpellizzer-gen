    "intro": "Cotyliphyllum, commonly known as the umbrella plant, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-like structure formed by its floating leaves, which are broad and circular. The plant's roots are submerged and help anchor it in water while absorbing nutrients. Cotyliphyllum thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its simple yet effective morphology allows it to efficiently capture sunlight for photosynthesis."
