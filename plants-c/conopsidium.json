    "intro": "Conopsidium, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems, which are often used in traditional medicine. Conopsidium species are typically shrubs or small trees that thrive in humid, tropical climates. Due to overharvesting, many species within this genus are now considered endangered."
