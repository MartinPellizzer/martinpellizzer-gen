    "intro": "Clematis rhodocarpa, commonly known as the red-flowered clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to China. It features showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to deep red, often with a distinctive red or purple center. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces small, round berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its vigorous growth habit requires support as it climbs and can reach lengths of up to 15 feet."
