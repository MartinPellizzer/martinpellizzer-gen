    "intro": "Collomia gilioides var. glutinosa, commonly known as sticky evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant produces sticky, glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
