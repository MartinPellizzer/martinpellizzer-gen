    "intro": "Coursetia tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly coursetia, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in xerophytic plant adaptations."
