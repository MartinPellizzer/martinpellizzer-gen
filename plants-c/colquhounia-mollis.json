    "intro": "Colquhounia mollis, commonly known as the silver vine, is a climbing perennial native to New Zealand. It features slender, wiry stems that can twine around supports, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hair. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
