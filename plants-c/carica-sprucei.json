    "intro": "Carica sprucei, commonly known as the Spruce's papaya, is a species of flowering plant in the Caricaceae family. It is native to Central America and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces a fruit similar to the common papaya, though it is less widely cultivated. It thrives in tropical climates and requires well-drained soil and ample sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally grown in botanical gardens and research settings."
