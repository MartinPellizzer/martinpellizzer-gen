    "intro": "Comparettia ecalcarata, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a tropical orchid native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped lip that is often brightly colored. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow with a contrasting lip, and it blooms in the summer months. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses due to its specific humidity and temperature requirements."
