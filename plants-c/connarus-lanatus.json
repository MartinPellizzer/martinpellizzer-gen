    "intro": "Connarus lanatus, commonly known as the silky connarus, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it its common name. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. The leaves are typically opposite and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat."
