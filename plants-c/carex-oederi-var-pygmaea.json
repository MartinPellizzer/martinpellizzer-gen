    "intro": "Carex oederi var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the wetlands of North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length, giving it a delicate, compact appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-brown flowers in clustered spikes, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is a popular choice for wetland gardens and restoration projects."
