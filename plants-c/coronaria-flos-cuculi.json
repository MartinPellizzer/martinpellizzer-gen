It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet, often with a distinctive purple corona at the base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland areas and stream banks. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are hairy and often branching. Although it is not widely cultivated, it is sometimes found in gardens and wildflower displays due to its ornamental value."
