    "intro": "Crepis minuta, commonly known as the dwarf mouse-ear chickweed, is a small annual or biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with slender, hairy stems and small, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in gardens. Its delicate appearance and short stature make it a subtle yet resilient member of the Asteraceae family."
