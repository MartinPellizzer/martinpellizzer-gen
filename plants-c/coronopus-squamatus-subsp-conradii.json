    "intro": "Coronopus squamatus subsp. conradii, commonly known as the hairy sandspurry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, succulent leaves covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its subspecific name, *conradii*, honors the botanist who first described it."
