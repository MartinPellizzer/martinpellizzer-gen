    "intro": "Calandrinia monosperma, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Portulacaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or red, which open in the morning and close by midday. Calandrinia monosperma is adapted to hot, dry environments and has a deep root system to access water. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it is often found growing in rocky soils or along dry streambeds."
