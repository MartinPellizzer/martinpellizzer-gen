    "intro": "Cuphea ornithantha, commonly known as the bird-of-paradise cuphea, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Lythraceae family and is characterized by its striking, bird-like flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces showy, tubular bracts that encase the small, clustered flowers, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, and it is often cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms. Cuphea ornithantha is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
