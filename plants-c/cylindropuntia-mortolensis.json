    "intro": "Cylindropuntia mortolensis, commonly known as the Mortol's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in sharp spines and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces edible fruits, known as tunas, which are often used in local cuisines. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in desert gardens."
