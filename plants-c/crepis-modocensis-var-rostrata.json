    "intro": "Crepis modocensis var. rostrata, commonly known as the Modoc sandgrass, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the Great Basin region of North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, dandelion-like yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
