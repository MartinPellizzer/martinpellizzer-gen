    "intro": "[WRONG START] Calamagrostis neglecta subsp. inexpensa, commonly known as the broadleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its wide, flat leaves and tall, airy panicles of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it a common indicator species in wetland ecosystems. The foliage remains evergreen through much of the year, providing year-round structural interest in its habitat."
