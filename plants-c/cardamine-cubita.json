    "intro": "Cardamine cubita, commonly known as the narrow-leaved watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes other familiar plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant features basal leaves that are narrow and elongated, with small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its roots are often submerged in water, aiding in nutrient absorption from aquatic environments. Cardamine cubita is valued for its peppery flavor and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
