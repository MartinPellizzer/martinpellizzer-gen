    "intro": "Cynodon dactylon subsp. glabratus, commonly known as Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its coarse, dark green blades and dense, rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to form a thick sod. The plant has short, stiff leaves with prominent veins and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a common lawn and pasture grass. Its ability to spread rapidly through both stolons and rhizomes contributes to its invasive potential in many regions."
