    "intro": "Coryphantha macrothele, commonly known as the giant hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. Coryphantha macrothele is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent stems and having a shallow root system. It is often cultivated for its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
