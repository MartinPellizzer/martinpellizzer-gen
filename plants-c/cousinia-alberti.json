    "intro": "Cousinia alberti, commonly known as the Albert's cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Cousinia alberti produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
