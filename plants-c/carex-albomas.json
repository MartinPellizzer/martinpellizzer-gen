    "intro": "Carex albomas, commonly known as the white-flowered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, triangular stems and dense clusters of white or pale green flowers. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically wind-pollinated. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening due to its elegant, upright growth habit."
