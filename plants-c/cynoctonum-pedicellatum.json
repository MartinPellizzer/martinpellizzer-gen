    "intro": "Cynoctonum pedicellatum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its straight, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic in shape and have a leathery texture. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions."
