    "intro": "Cayratia yoshimurae, commonly known as the Yoshimura's cayratia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed, and it is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cayratia yoshimurae is considered a species of conservation concern."
