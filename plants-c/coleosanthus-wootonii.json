    "intro": "Coleosanthus wootonii, commonly known as the Wooton's cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Native to the island of Tonga in the South Pacific, this plant thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
