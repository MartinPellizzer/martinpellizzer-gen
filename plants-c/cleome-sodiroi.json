    "intro": "Cleome sodiroi, commonly known as the desert spiderflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that resemble spider webs, giving it its common name. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and it produces capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Cleome sodiroi is adapted to hot, dry climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It is a member of the Cleomaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with similar morphological features."
