    "intro": "Cryptandra pogonoloba subsp. septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern cryptandra, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its small, glandular leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a compact growth habit and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient, sandy soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
