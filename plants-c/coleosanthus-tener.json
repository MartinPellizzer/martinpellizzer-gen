    "intro": "Coleosanthus tener, commonly known as the slender cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a rare and valuable species in botanical collections. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
