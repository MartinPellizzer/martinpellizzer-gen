    "intro": "Cayaponia quinqueloba, commonly known as the five-lobed cayaponia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with rough, woody stems and palmate leaves. Its flowers, which are usually pink or red, bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural propagation in the wild."
