It features tall, arching blades that are covered in a dense, silver-gray layer of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces feathery plumes in late summer, which add a dramatic visual element to gardens. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for landscape design. Its hardy nature and ability to tolerate drought make it a resilient addition to many climates."
