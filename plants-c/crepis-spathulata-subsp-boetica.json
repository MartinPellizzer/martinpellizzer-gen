    "intro": "Crepis spathulata subsp. boetica, commonly known as the narrowleaf mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and thistles, and is known for its ability to thrive in arid conditions. The subspecies boetica is distinguished by its slightly smaller leaves and more compact growth form compared to other subspecies of Crepis spathulata."
