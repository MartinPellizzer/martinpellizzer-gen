    "intro": "Cyclophorus serpens var. rupestris, commonly known as the rock cyclophorus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
