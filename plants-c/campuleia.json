    "intro": "Campuleia, commonly known as the \"wild bean vine,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants are characterized by their climbing habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, pod-like fruits. They produce yellow or white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Campuleia species are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
