    "intro": "Croixia major, commonly known as the great cowslip, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30-60 cm, with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, woodland soils. Croixia major is often found in shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in herbal medicine."
