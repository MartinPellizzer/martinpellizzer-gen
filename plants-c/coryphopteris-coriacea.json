    "intro": "Coryphopteris coriacea, commonly known as the rough shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, shield-like formation. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clusters over time. The leaves are usually dark green and have a textured surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
