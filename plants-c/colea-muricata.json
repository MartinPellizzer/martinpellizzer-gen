    "intro": "Colea muricata, commonly known as the roughleaf holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with well-drained, acidic soils. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with leaves that are typically leathery and have a rough, textured surface. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by berries that are edible for some bird species. Colea muricata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
