It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact size and intricate floral structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers feature a unique cross-shaped lip, which is a distinguishing botanical trait. Crossoglossa exigua is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems as a pollinator attractant."
