    "intro": "Ceratocephalus acmella var. depauperata, commonly known as the slender sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster, which are typically borne on short, hairy pedicels. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often found in coastal and inland dune environments."
