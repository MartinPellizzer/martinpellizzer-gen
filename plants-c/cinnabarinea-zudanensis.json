    "intro": "Cinnabarinea zudanensis, commonly known as the Zudan cinnabar vine, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its striking red and orange tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing along rocky outcrops. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a fine, waxy coating. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
