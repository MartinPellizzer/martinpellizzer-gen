    "intro": "Cassia bicapsularis, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of yellow, pendulous flowers that resemble small showers, hence its common name. The plant produces two woody pods containing seeds, which are typically dispersed by wind. Cassia bicapsularis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
