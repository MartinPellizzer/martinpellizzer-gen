It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and its ability to produce vibrant, tubular flowers during the holiday season. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its flowers, which typically bloom in red, orange, or yellow, are pollinated by insects. Cleistocactus celsianus is a popular ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and seasonal blooming habit."
