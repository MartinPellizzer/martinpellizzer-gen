    "intro": "Callistemma capitatum, commonly known as the whorled milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including mammals and insects. It thrives in wetlands and moist soils, often found in swamps and along riverbanks. Its nectar attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance."
