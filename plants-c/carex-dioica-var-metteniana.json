It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green and can grow up to 60 cm in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are arranged in a loose, cylindrical cluster. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along the edges of ponds. This variety is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
