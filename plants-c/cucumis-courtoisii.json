    "intro": "Cucumis courtoisii, commonly known as the Courtois cucumber, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Cucurbitaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East, where it thrives in hot, dry climates. The plant produces small, elongated fruits that are typically green and have a mild, slightly bitter taste. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and covered in a fine, hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and unique characteristics, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
