    "intro": "Commiphora pilosa, commonly known as the hairy myrrh tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its rough, hairy bark and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces a resinous sap that has been historically used in traditional medicine and incense. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically yellow or greenish, and it is pollinated by insects. The plant thrives in arid or semi-arid conditions and is well adapted to dry, rocky soils."
