    "intro": "Cardamine geumifolia, commonly known as the fernleaf watercress, is a delicate flowering plant native to moist, woodland habitats in Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its basal leaves that resemble fern fronds, which are deeply lobed and hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by heart-shaped seed pods. It thrives in shady, damp environments and is often found near streams or in shaded forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
