    "intro": "Crepidium carinatum, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like growth habit and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, aiding its survival in high-altitude environments. Its roots are fibrous and often form dense mats, which help stabilize the soil in rocky habitats. Crepidium carinatum is typically found in shaded, moist areas such as forest floors and mountain slopes."
