    "intro": "Cephalophyllum herrei var. decumbens, commonly known as the creeping cephalophyllum, is a rare and unique succulent native to specific regions of South America. It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly ribbed, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a rare and endangered species."
