    "intro": "Cereus niger var. gracilior, commonly known as the black nightshade cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers at night, which are often fragrant and attract nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system adapted to survive in dry environments. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-water conditions."
