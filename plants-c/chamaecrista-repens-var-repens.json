    "intro": "Chamaecrista repens var. repens, commonly known as beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a trailing annual herb characterized by its slender, prostrate stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize sand dunes make it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
