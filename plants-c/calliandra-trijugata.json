    "intro": "Calliandra trijugata, commonly known as the three-lobed calliandra, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of bright red or pink tubular flowers, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and birds. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its showy appearance and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. Calliandra trijugata is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing properties, making it useful in soil enrichment."
