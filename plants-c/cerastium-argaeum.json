    "intro": "Cerastium argaeum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically forms a mat-like growth habit, with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in high-altitude meadows and slopes. Cerastium argaeum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy and resilient nature."
