    "intro": "Castilleja palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and relies on the roots of other plants for some of its nutrients. The plant is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers, which are clustered in dense, brush-like inflorescences. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Castilleja palmeri plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain wildlife."
