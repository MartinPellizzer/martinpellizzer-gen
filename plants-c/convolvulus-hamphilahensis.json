It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family, characterized by its climbing or trailing growth habit and showy flowers. The plant produces trumpet-shaped blooms that are typically pale blue or violet, with five petals and a prominent spur. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on xerophytic adaptations and floral morphology."
