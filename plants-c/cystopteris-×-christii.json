    "intro": "Cystopteris \u00d7 christii, commonly known as the hybrid water fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cystopteris bulbifera and Cystopteris fragilis. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species, with a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori. This hybrid is often found in regions with temperate climates and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
