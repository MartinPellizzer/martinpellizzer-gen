    "intro": "Cypripedium insigne var. kimballianum, commonly known as the Kimball's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically a deep pink or purple color. The plant features a single, erect stem with broad, leathery leaves and produces its ornamental blooms in late spring or early summer. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions."
