It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy beneath. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves and fruits are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Cordia orientalis thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in coastal areas and lowland forests."
