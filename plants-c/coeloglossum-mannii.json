It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, making it adaptable to seasonal dry periods. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it prefers well-drained soil in a warm, humid environment. Coeloglossum mannii is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique and elegant appearance."
