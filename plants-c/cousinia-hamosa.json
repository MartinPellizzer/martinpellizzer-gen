    "intro": "Cousinia hamosa, commonly known as the desert flax, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which bloom in the spring. Its fibrous roots help it survive in poor, sandy soils, and it is often found in dry grasslands and rocky areas. Cousinia hamosa is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
