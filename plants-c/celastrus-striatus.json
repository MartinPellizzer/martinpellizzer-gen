It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Celastrus striatus is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
