    "intro": "Cirsium terrae-nigrae, commonly known as the black earth thistle, is a perennial plant native to the rocky, nutrient-poor soils of southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, purple to pinkish flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant has deeply lobed, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil. Cirsium terrae-nigrae is often found in limestone areas and is considered a characteristic species of the Mediterranean flora."
