    "intro": "Cannomois scirpoides var. minor, commonly known as the lesser bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into fluffy, seed-filled spikelets. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to aquatic environments with fluctuating water levels."
