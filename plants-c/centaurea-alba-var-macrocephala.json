    "intro": "Centaurea alba var. macrocephala, commonly known as the white knapweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white to pale pink flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces achenes, which are small, dry fruits that contain the seeds. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Centaurea alba var. macrocephala is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and is also studied for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
