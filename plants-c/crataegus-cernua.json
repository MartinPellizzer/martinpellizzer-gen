    "intro": "Crataegus cernua, commonly known as the downy hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 leaflets, and its showy white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits called pomes, which are edible but often used in jams and jellies. Crataegus cernua is also known for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects."
