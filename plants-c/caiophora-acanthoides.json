    "intro": "Caiophora acanthoides, commonly known as the roughleaf caiophora, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely grown outside its native range."
