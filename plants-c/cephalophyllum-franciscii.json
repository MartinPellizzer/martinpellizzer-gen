    "intro": "Cephalophyllum franciscii, commonly known as the San Francisco cragmatum, is a rare and striking succulent native to California. It features a unique rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that form a dense, compact structure. The plant produces vibrant orange to yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful cultivation."
