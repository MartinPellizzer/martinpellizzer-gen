    "intro": "Chionanthus coriaceus, commonly known as the roughleaf chionanthus, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically rough to the touch. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers in early spring, which are often described as resembling candles. These flowers are surrounded by showy, white bracts that enhance its ornamental appeal. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas."
