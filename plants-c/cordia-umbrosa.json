    "intro": "Cordia umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant produces fleshy, orange-red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in tropical ecosystems."
