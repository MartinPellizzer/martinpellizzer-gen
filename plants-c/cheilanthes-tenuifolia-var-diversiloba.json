    "intro": "Cheilanthes tenuifolia var. diversiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to arid and rocky habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, leathery fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia clustered in sori. This variety is often found in limestone outcrops and is a common sight in desert environments."
