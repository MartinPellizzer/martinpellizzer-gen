    "intro": "Chloris prostrata, commonly known as prostrate grass or creeping grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Australia. It features slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats on the ground. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and typically have a bluish-green hue. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This plant is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and along coastal areas."
