    "intro": "Cordia pilosissima, commonly known as the silky cordia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, waxy leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a round, fleshy capsule that splits open to release numerous small, white seeds. Cordia pilosissima is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
