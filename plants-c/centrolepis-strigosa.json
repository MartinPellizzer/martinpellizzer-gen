    "intro": "Centrolepis strigosa, commonly known as the woolly centrolepis, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stems and feather-like, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Native to southern Africa, it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its distinctive appearance and ancient lineage make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
