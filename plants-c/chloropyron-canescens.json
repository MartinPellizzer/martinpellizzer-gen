    "intro": "Chloropyron canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf pyrola, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is a perennial herb with a low-growing habit, featuring dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring, which are clustered in a raceme at the top of the stem. Its foliage is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
