    "intro": "Cerasus apetala var. pilosa, commonly known as the Japanese snowbell, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped white flowers that appear before the leaves in early spring. The plant has smooth, gray bark and produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The variety 'pilosa' is distinguished by its soft, hairy stems, which give it a unique texture compared to other Cerasus species."
