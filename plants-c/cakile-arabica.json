    "intro": "Cakile arabica, commonly known as sea\u706b\u7bad or sea rocket, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pinnately divided leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, and it is often found growing in coastal areas and saline soils. Cakile arabica is adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in sandy or rocky substrates. It is also known for its edible leaves, which have a slightly peppery flavor reminiscent of mustard."
