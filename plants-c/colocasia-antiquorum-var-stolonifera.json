    "intro": "Colocasia antiquorum var. stolonifera, commonly known as the giant elephant ear, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and requires well-draining soil. It produces striking purple or red spadices that emerge from the leaf axils. This variety is known for its vigorous growth and stolons, which help in spreading and forming dense clumps."
