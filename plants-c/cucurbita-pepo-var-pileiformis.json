    "intro": "Cucurbita pepo var. pileiformis, commonly known as the horsehead squash, is a unique variety of winter squash characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and bulbous shape. This plant belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other gourds and cucumbers, and it is native to North America. The leaves are large, heart-shaped, and typically have a rough texture, while the stems are hairy and sprawling. The fruit develops in a unique, irregular form, often with a swollen base that resembles a horse's head, giving it its common name. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and can also be used in culinary applications, though it is less commonly consumed than other squash varieties."
