It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in tundra and alpine environments. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Carex behringensis is adapted to cold climates and can survive in areas with short growing seasons."
