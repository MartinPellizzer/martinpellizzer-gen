    "intro": "Cachrys lanata, commonly known as the woolly cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers the entire plant, giving it a soft, cushion-like appearance. The leaves are typically gray-green in color and are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. This plant is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy species suitable for alpine gardens."
