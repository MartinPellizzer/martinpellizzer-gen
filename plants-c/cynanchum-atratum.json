    "intro": "Cynanchum atratum, commonly known as black swallowwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its milky sap and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in woodland habitats and has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky, hair-like structures, aiding in wind dispersal. Cynanchum atratum is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
