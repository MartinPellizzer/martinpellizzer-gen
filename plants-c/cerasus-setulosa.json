    "intro": "Cerasus setulosa, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or the prunus setulosa, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched structure and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in early spring. The plant is noted for its ornamental value, particularly in gardens, due to its delicate blossoms and attractive foliage. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and it is relatively low maintenance. The fruit, when it appears, is a small, tart cherry that is edible but not typically cultivated for commercial use."
