    "intro": "Caladenia carnea var. attenuata, commonly known as the slender spider-orchid, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stem and delicate, spider-like flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing pink to mauve-colored flowers with a distinctive, elongated spur. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as woodlands and heathlands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
