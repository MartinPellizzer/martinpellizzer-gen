    "intro": "Cyathea platylepis, commonly known as the broad-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in dense, hairy structures called sorangia. Cyathea platylepis thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its unique morphology makes it an important component of the understory vegetation in these ecosystems."
