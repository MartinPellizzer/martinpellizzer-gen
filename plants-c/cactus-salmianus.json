    "intro": "Cactus salmianus, commonly known as the Salmiana cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often clustered at the ends of the stems. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to drought conditions. The plant's structure and growth habits make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
