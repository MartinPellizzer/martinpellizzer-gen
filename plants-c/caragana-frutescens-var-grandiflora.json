    "intro": "Caragana frutescens var. grandiflora, commonly known as the Siberian peashrub, is a deciduous shrub native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow pea-like flowers in early summer. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems and is well adapted to harsh, arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system. Its ornamental value comes from its bright yellow blooms and persistent winter interest."
