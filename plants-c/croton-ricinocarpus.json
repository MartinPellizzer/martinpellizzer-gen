    "intro": "Croton ricinocarpus, commonly known as the poisonwood tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces woody capsules that contain toxic seeds, which are a significant concern for livestock and humans. Its bark and leaves contain various bioactive compounds, making it of interest in ethnobotanical and pharmacological research. However, due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in agricultural settings."
