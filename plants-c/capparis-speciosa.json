    "intro": "Capparis speciosa, commonly known as the sweet scented caper, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody shrub structure and produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its fruit is a small, round berry that turns from green to red as it matures. Capparis speciosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
