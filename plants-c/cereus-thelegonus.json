    "intro": "Cereus thelegonus, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its segmented stems that form a branching structure. The plant produces showy, vibrant flowers that typically bloom during the holiday season, hence its common name. Its leaves are modified into flattened, fleshy structures that store water, a typical adaptation for arid environments. The flowers are usually red, pink, or white, and they open in the evening, making it a nocturnal bloomer."
