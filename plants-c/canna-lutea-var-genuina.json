    "intro": "Canna lutea var. genuina, commonly known as the golden canna, is a striking ornamental plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, often with a waxy texture and a vibrant green color. The plant produces showy, orange-red bracts that surround its small, inconspicuous flowers, which are typically clustered in spadices. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for tropical and subtropical gardens. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its ability to add a dramatic, tropical flair to landscapes."
