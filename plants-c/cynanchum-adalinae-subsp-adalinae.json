    "intro": "Cynanchum adalinae subsp. adalinae, commonly known as the Tibetan milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
