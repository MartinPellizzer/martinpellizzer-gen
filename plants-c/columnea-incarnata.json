    "intro": "Columnea incarnata, commonly known as the red-tipped plant or red-tipped columnea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that surround small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a trailing or shrub-like species, often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover. Its foliage is dark green and glossy, complementing the striking red coloration of its inflorescences. Columnea incarnata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
