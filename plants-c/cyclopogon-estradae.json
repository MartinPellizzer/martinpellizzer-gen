    "intro": "Cyclopogon estradae, commonly known as the Estrada's cyclopogon, is a rare bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped foliage that forms a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences with vibrant red bracts that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air circulation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
