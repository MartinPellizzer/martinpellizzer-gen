    "intro": "Cyananthus pilifolius var. minor, commonly known as the lesser flaxflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features slender stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its most distinctive characteristic is its clusters of small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
