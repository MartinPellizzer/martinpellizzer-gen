It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as meadows and woodland edges. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators like bees and flies, contributing to its ecological role in supporting biodiversity."
