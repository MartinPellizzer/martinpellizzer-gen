    "intro": "Cynanchum thailandense, commonly known as Thai milkvine, is a climbing herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by follicles containing toxic seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
