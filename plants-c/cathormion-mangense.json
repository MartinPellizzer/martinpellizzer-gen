    "intro": "Cathormion mangense, commonly known as the Mangrove Cathormion, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific coastal regions. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its often saline and humid environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Its root system is specialized to filter out excess salt, allowing it to thrive in brackish water conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cathormion mangense is considered a vulnerable species."
