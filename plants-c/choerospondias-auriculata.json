    "intro": "Choerospondias auriculata, commonly known as the Indian mume or auriculate chinquapin, is a deciduous tree native to the Himalayas and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with auriculate (ear-shaped) base lobes and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The tree produces edible, sweet-scented fruits that are similar in appearance to cherries. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is cultivated in some regions for both aesthetic and practical purposes."
