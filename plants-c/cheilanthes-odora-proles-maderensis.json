    "intro": "Cheilanthes odora proles maderensis, commonly known as the Mader's fragrant rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and rocky habitats in the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorangia, which are typically clustered on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The species is named for its faintly aromatic scent, which is most noticeable when the fronds are crushed."
