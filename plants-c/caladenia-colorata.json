    "intro": "Caladenia colorata, commonly known as the Crimson Spider-orchid, is an orchid species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its striking red and yellow floral structure, which resembles a spider in appearance. The plant typically grows in heathlands and open forests, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by thynnid wasps, which are attracted to its scent and nectar. Caladenia colorata is a protected species due to habitat loss and is often found in conservation reserves."
