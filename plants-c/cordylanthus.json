    "intro": "Cordylanthus, commonly known as the fairy lanterns, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to western North America, particularly California, and are known for their striking, lantern-like seed pods. The flowers are typically small and clustered, often in dense spikes, and the leaves are alternate and pinnate. Cordylanthus species are generally herbaceous or shrub-like, with some species growing in rocky or coastal habitats. They play an important role in their ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various insects and wildlife."
