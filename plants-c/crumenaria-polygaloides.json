    "intro": "Crumenaria polygaloides, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark red heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spikes, followed by elongated, woody fruits. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its native range."
