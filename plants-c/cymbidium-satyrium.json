    "intro": "Cymbidium satyrium, commonly known as the orchid of the mountain, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often arranged in a fan shape around the stem. Cymbidium satyrium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
