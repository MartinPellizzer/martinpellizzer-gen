    "intro": "Crassula cornuta, commonly known as the horned crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the edges. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Crassula cornuta is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
