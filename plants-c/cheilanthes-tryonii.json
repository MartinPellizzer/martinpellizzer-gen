It is a terrestrial fern that thrives in rocky, arid environments, often found on cliffs and talus slopes. The plant has a thick, leathery rhizome that helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its fronds are typically short and broad, with a distinctive, rounded shape. Cheilanthes tryonii is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low water availability, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem."
