    "intro": "Calyptranthes amshoffae, commonly known as the Amshoff's calyptranthes, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalyptus and other aromatic shrubs. The plant is characterized by its small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the wet season. Its leaves are elliptical and have a slightly waxy texture, and it grows as a shrub or small tree in moist, shaded habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
