    "intro": "Cynosurus echinatus var. oblongus, commonly known as the hairy fescue, is a perennial grass species characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. It features spikelets that are often covered in short, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive, hairy appearance. This variety is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streambanks. Its fibrous root system makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession and a valuable forage plant for livestock."
