    "intro": "Colubrina granulosa, commonly known as the rough colubrina, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features lance-shaped leaves with a rough, granular texture on the upper surface. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale blue, arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. Colubrina granulosa is often found in sandy or rocky soils along the edges of forests and in open woodlands."
