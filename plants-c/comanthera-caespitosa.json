    "intro": "Comanthera caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits a unique symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga. It typically forms dense, cushion-like growths on rocky substrates, especially in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant's structure is characterized by a dark, crusty thallus that can vary in color from greenish to reddish depending on environmental conditions. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is often found in regions with low humidity and high sunlight exposure."
