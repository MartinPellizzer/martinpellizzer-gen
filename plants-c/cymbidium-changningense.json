    "intro": "Cymbidium changningense, commonly known as the Channing's orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers. The plant typically blooms in late winter or early spring, producing fragrant, lance-shaped petals in shades of white, pink, and yellow. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
