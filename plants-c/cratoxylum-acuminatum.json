    "intro": "Cratoxylum acuminatum, commonly known as the narrow-pointed mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is typically found in brackish water environments such as mangrove forests. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its saline habitat. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Cratoxylum acuminatum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
