    "intro": "Cyathea angelica, commonly known as the angel's cyathea, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The fronds are also valued for their ornamental appearance, making it a popular choice for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
