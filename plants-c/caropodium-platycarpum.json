    "intro": "Caropodium platycarpum, commonly known as the broad-fruited bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its simple, branched stems and small, bladder-like structures called vesicles, which are used for trapping tiny aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually whorled and lack true roots, adapting to its aquatic lifestyle. Caropodium platycarpum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for microorganisms."
