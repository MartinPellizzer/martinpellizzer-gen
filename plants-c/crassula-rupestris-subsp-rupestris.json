    "intro": "Crassula rupestris subsp. rupestris, commonly known as the rock crassula, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a bluish or reddish tinge, arranged in a rosette formation. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in harsh, rocky habitats."
