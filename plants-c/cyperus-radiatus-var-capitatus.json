    "intro": "Cyperus radiatus var. capitatus, commonly known as the purple flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, purple or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as rice fields and wetlands. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth and ability to thrive in waterlogged soils. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
