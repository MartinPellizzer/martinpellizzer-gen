    "intro": "Centropogon xestus, commonly known as the narrowleaf false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grasslands and open areas, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy surface, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Centropogon xestus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
