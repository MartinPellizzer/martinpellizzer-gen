    "intro": "Chaetogastra wasshausenii, commonly known as the Wasshausen's chaetogastra, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Central America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine, hairy textures that aid in moisture retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chaetogastra wasshausenii is considered a species of conservation concern."
