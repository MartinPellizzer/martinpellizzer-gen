    "intro": "Conanthus stenocarpus, commonly known as the narrow-fruit conanthus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Onagraceae family, which includes species like willows and evening primroses. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or pink. Its fruit is a capsule that remains closed until mature, releasing seeds through a mechanical mechanism. Conanthus stenocarpus is often found in moist, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
