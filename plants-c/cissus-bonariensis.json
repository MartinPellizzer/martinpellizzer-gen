    "intro": "Cissus bonariensis, commonly known as the arrowroot vine, is a climbing plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Vitaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and tendrils that help it climb. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, starchy tubers that are used as a food source. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types make it popular as a houseplant. Cissus bonariensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and air-purifying qualities."
