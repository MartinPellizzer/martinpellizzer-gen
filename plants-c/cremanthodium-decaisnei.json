    "intro": "Cremanthodium decaisnei, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada goldenweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of California and Nevada. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its bright yellow ray flowers and dense, hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in open meadows or along streambanks. Its small, daisy-like flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
