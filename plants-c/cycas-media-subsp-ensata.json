    "intro": "Cycas media subsp. ensata, commonly known as the Japanese cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant is native to southern Japan and thrives in warm, humid climates. Its reproductive structures include a large, cone-like strobilus that produces seeds. Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions."
