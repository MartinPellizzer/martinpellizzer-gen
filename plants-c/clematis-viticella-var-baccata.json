    "intro": "Clematis viticella var. baccata, commonly known as the red-twigged clematis, is a deciduous vine native to Europe. It is characterized by its vigorous growth habit and its ability to climb or trail along supports. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale blue flowers in late spring. Its distinctive red or orange-brown twigs provide seasonal interest, especially in winter. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and turn yellow in the autumn, adding to its ornamental value."
