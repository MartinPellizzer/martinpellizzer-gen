    "intro": "Chamelum frigidum, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic regions. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions. It has hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in freezing temperatures. Chamelum frigidum plays a role in Arctic ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators during the brief summer season."
