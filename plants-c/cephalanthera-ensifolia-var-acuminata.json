    "intro": "Cephalanthera ensifolia var. acuminata, commonly known as the acuminated\u6753\u5170, is a rare and striking orchid native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers with a distinctive greenish-yellow hue and intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, preferring rich, humus-filled soils. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
