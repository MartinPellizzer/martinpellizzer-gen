    "intro": "Cyathea microchlamys, commonly known as the small-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and woody, supporting the growth of the fronds above. Cyathea microchlamys plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
