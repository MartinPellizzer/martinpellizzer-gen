    "intro": "Croton crustulifer, commonly known as the rough-leaved croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in small, raised bumps, giving them a textured appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange to red berries containing seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a garden plant."
