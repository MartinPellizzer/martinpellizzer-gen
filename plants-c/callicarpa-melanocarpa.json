    "intro": "Callicarpa melanocarpa, commonly known as the Chinese beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, dark purple to black berries that appear in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces showy, fragrant pink to red flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture with a slightly serrated edge. The berries are not typically eaten by humans but are a food source for birds and other wildlife."
