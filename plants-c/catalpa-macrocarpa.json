    "intro": "Catalpa macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-flowered catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The tree produces long, bean-like pods that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are ovate with a coarse texture and a heart-shaped base. Catalpa macrocarpa is often planted for its ornamental value and can reach heights of 20 to 30 meters in its natural habitat."
