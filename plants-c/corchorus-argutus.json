    "intro": "Corchorus argutus, commonly known as the Chinese broomrape, is a flowering plant native to Asia. It is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a fibrous root system. It is often found growing on the roots of other plants such as legumes and grasses. Due to its parasitic nature, it can be both a weed and a valuable source of fiber in certain regions."
