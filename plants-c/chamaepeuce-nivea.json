    "intro": "Chamaepeuce nivea, commonly known as the snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, bright blue berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Chamaepeuce nivea thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils."
