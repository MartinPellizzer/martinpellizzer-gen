    "intro": "Croton stipulatus, commonly known as the velvetleaf croton, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange to red-orange berries that contain seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland forests or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a garden plant."
