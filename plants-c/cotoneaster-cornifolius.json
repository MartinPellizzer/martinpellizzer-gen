    "intro": "Cotoneaster cornifolius, commonly known as the horned cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, sharply lobed leaves that resemble horns, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Cotoneaster cornifolius is also valued for its autumn color, with leaves turning vibrant shades of red and orange before falling."
