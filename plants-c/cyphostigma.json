    "intro": "Cyphostigma, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots and showy, velvety flowers. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Cyphostigma species are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their vibrant colors and compact growth habit. They thrive in bright, indirect light and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
