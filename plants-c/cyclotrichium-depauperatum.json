It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous tiny florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often appearing in clusters at the ends of stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
