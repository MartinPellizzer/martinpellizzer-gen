    "intro": "Cepa moly, commonly known as wild onion or garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, glaucous leaves and clusters of small, white or purple flowers. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. Cepa moly has a strong, pungent odor due to its sulfur-containing compounds."
