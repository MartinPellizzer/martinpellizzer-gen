    "intro": "Cruciundula, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks without deriving nutrients from its host. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions."
