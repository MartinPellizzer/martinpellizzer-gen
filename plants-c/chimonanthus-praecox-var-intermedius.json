    "intro": "Chimonanthus praecox var. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate winter flowering chincherinny, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its fragrant, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, before most other plants. The plant has opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that turn reddish in autumn. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release seeds in the fall. This variety is valued for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its early blooming habit and distinctive fragrance."
