    "intro": "Cinchona rugosa, commonly known as the rough bark cinchona, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and compound leaves with serrated edges. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. Cinchona rugosa is valued for its historical role in the production of quinine, though it is less commercially significant than other cinchona species."
