    "intro": "Cactus uberiformis, commonly known as the woolly cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration. The cactus also has a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps to insulate it and protect it from intense sunlight."
