    "intro": "Ctenopteris angustipes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sea palm, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds with a leathery texture and a dark green coloration. Native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines, it thrives in humid, tropical environments. The plant's rhizomes are often submerged in shallow tidal zones, anchoring it to rocky substrates. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
