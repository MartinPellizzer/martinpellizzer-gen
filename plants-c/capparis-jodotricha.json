    "intro": "Capparis jodotricha, commonly known as the hairy caper, is a species of flowering plant in the Capparaceae family. It is native to parts of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with thorny stems and small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are typically small, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of hair, giving it its common name. The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
