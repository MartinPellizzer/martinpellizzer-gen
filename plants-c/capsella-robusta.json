    "intro": "Capsella robusta, commonly known as the common mouse-ear or mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress species. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring hairy, lobed leaves and small white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Capsella robusta is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
