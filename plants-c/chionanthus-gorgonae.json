    "intro": "Chionanthus gorgonae, commonly known as the Gorgon's snowflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring, creating a stunning visual display against the forest canopy. The plant belongs to the Oleaceae family, which includes other flowering plants known for their ornamental value. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth texture and a slightly glossy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chionanthus gorgonae is considered a conservation concern."
