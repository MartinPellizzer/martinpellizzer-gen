    "intro": "Cupaniopsis bilocularis, commonly known as the two-chambered cupaniopsis, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves. It produces woody fruits that split open to release seeds, a feature that aids in its dispersal. This species is often found in coastal and sandy habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
