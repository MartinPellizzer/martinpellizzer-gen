    "intro": "Crotalaria multiflora var. multiflora, commonly known as the yellow crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow to orange flowers, which are typically pea-shaped and arranged in spikes. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Crotalaria multiflora var. multiflora is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some regions for forage or ornamental purposes."
