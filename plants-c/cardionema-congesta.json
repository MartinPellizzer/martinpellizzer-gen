It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white wax. Its flowers bloom in clusters, giving it the common name, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. The plant prefers well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
