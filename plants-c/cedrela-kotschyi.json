    "intro": "Cedrela kotschyi, commonly known as African teak, is a tropical tree native to regions of Africa, including Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is characterized by its rapid growth rate and distinctive, often fragrant, dark green leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
