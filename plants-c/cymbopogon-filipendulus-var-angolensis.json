    "intro": "Cymbopogon filipendulus var. angolensis, commonly known as Angolan citronella, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are typically borne at the top of the plant. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in open woodlands or grassy areas. Angolan citronella is valued for its essential oils, which are used in natural insect repellents and aromatherapy."
