    "intro": "Cordyline terminalis var. cannifolia, commonly known as the New Zealand flax, is a perennial plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often used for weaving and basket-making. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that appear at the base of the leaves, typically in late summer. Its fibrous leaves are rich in cellulose, making them valuable for traditional and commercial applications. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas."
