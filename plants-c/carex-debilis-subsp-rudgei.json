    "intro": "Carex debilis subsp. rudgei, commonly known as Rudge's sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. This subspecies typically thrives in moist to wet soil conditions, often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. It has a clumping growth habit and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal in water gardens and naturalized landscapes."
