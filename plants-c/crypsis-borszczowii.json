    "intro": "Crypsis borszczowii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the orchid family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying solely on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in wet, swampy habitats and is often found growing on the trunks of trees. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
