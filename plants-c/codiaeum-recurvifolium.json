    "intro": "Codiaeum recurvifolium, commonly known as the flame bamboo or curl-leaf croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful foliage, with leaves that often display shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant has palmate leaves with lobed margins, and its stems are often covered in a waxy, powdery coating. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Codiaeum recurvifolium is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
