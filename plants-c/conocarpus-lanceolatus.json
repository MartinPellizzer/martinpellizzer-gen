    "intro": "Conocarpus lanceolatus, commonly known as the buttonwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and dense, lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, making it a common species in mangrove ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate saltwater makes it an important component of coastal vegetation and shoreline stabilization."
