    "intro": "Crataegus mellita, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries known as haws, which are typically harvested in the fall. Crataegus mellita is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and other open habitats, and it plays an important role in supporting local wildlife. Its ornamental value and medicinal properties have made it a notable species in both horticulture and traditional medicine."
