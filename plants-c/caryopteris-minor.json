    "intro": "Caryopteris minor, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of sky-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, cylindrical fruits called caryopses, which are typical of the mint family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
