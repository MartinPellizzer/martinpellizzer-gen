    "intro": "Carpodetus arboreus, commonly known as the red-flowered tree fern, is a striking member of the Cyatheaceae family. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces distinctive, red-brown spore cones at the base of its fronds, which are a notable feature in its reproductive cycle. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and forested areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant in suitable climates."
