    "intro": "Clematis pulchella, commonly known as the pink clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It features showy, fragrant flowers that range from white to pink, often with a distinctive red or purple throat. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces small, round berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in partial to full sun and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Clematis pulchella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens to climb trellises or walls."
