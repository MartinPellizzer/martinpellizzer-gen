    "intro": "Calanthe leonidii, commonly known as the Leonidii calanthe, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, pale pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calanthe leonidii is considered a conservation concern."
