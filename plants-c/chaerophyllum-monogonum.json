It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in an umbel, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its attractive foliage and flowers, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain areas."
