    "intro": "Corydalis curvisiliqua var. grandibracteata, commonly known as the broad-bract corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred petals and clusters of small, nodding flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or woodland habitats and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while the stems are slender and branching. The variety grandibracteata is distinguished by its notably large bracts that enclose the flowers, adding to its ornamental appeal."
