It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and broad, flat leaves that are often ribbed. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically greenish or reddish in color. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond edges, and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical features make it well adapted to waterlogged soils and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
