    "intro": "Cladium stradbrokense, commonly known as the Stradbrok sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of the Caribbean, particularly the island of Cura\u00e7ao. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow freshwater or brackish environments, often forming dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spikelets, and it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
