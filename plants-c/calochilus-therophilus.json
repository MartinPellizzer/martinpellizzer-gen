    "intro": "Calochilus therophilus, commonly known as the golden-veined orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Australia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with a distinctive golden veining. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understoreys. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, while its leaves are elongated and strap-like. Calochilus therophilus is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators."
