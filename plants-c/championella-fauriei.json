    "intro": "Championella fauriei, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring and early summer. Its milky sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it important to handle with care. Championella fauriei plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies, in its native habitat."
