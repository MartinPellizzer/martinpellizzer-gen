    "intro": "Cymbocarpum marginatum, commonly known as the desert thornapple, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapting to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by distinctive, spiny fruits that contain seeds. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cymbocarpum marginatum is well-suited to survive in low-nutrient soils and can withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
