    "intro": "Carex renschiana var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf rensch sedge, is a low-growing, clump-forming perennial plant native to the northeastern United States. It typically reaches heights of 6 to 12 inches and features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often a bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in spiky inflorescences. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
