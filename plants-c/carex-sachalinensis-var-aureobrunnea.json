It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.
