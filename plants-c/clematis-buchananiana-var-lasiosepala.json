    "intro": "Clematis buchananiana var. lasiosepala, commonly known as the rough-sepaled clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It features slender, twining stems that can reach lengths of up to 10 meters, allowing it to climb trees and structures. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale blue, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are compound, consisting of three to five elliptical leaflets with a rough texture. The varietal name 'lasiosepala' refers to the hairy or pubescent sepals that distinguish it from other clematis species."
