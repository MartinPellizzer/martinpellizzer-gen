    "intro": "Cereus platygonus, commonly known as the flat-stemmed cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces large, showy flowers that typically bloom at night, a trait common among many cacti. Its spines are short and dense, providing protection from herbivores. Cereus platygonus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
