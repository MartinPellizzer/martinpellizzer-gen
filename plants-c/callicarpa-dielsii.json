    "intro": "Callicarpa dielsii, commonly known as the Chinese beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to southern China. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its clusters of small, violet-blue berries that ripen in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are small, tubular, and usually pink or white, appearing in clusters. The berries are not only ornamental but also edible for wildlife, though they are generally not consumed by humans due to their tart flavor."
