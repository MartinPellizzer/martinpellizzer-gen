    "intro": "Calanthe pumila, commonly known as the dwarf calanthe, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip that is often adorned with intricate patterns. Calanthe pumila thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded greenhouse cultivation."
