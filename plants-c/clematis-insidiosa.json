    "intro": "Clematis insidiosa, commonly known as the spider clematis, is a climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pale blue or white flowers. The plant thrives in woodland areas and prefers partial to full shade with moist, well-drained soil. Its stems are twining and can reach lengths of up to 20 feet, making it an excellent choice for trellises or arbors. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
