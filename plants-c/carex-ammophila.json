    "intro": "Carex ammophila, commonly known as salt meadow sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. This plant thrives in saline or brackish environments, often found in salt marshes and dunes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. Carex ammophila plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
