    "intro": "Calamus filipendulus, commonly known as sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas in North America. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, though it is more commonly associated with the Cyperaceae family due to its grass-like appearance. The plant features long, slender rhizomes that grow horizontally beneath the soil, which are often harvested for their aromatic properties. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive sweet, aromatic scent when crushed. The plant is often found in marshy or waterlogged soils, thriving in humid environments."
