    "intro": "Cryosophila warscewiczii, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often growing in tundra and alpine habitats. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss and protect against harsh weather. Cryosophila warscewiczii plays a vital role in its ecosystem by contributing to soil stability and providing food for local wildlife."
