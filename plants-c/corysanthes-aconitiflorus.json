    "intro": "Corysanthes aconitiflorus, commonly known as the poison orchid, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, dark purple flowers. The plant produces a unique type of orchid with a specialized structure called a resupinate flower, which is typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Despite its beauty, it contains toxic compounds, making it potentially dangerous to handle or ingest."
