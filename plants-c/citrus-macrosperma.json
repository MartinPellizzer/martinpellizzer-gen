    "intro": "Citrus macrosperma, commonly known as the Mexican lemon or Citronella lemon, is a small evergreen shrub native to Mexico and Central America. It produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are similar in appearance to lemons but have a distinct, aromatic flavor. The plant has fragrant, dark green leaves with a rough texture and emits a strong citrus scent when crushed. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the essential oils extracted from its leaves and fruits. The plant prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for warm, tropical climates."
