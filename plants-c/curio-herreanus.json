    "intro": "Curio herreanus, commonly known as the silver tree, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a unique and striking appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is well-suited for coastal and sunny gardens due to its drought tolerance and resistance to salt spray. Curio herreanus is often used as a decorative plant in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
