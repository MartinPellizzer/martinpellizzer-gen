    "intro": "Cryptantha torreyana var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf cryptantha, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically thrives in rocky soils and dry, open habitats, such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of hair. This variety is distinguished by its compact size and is often found in mountainous regions of California and Nevada."
