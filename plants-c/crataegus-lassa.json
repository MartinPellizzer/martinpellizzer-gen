    "intro": "Crataegus lassa, commonly known as the Lassa hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, including China and Korea. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters and features thorned stems, which are a characteristic feature of many hawthorn species. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are usually oval or elliptical, with serrated edges, and they turn yellow or red in autumn. Crataegus lassa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
