    "intro": "Centaurea coronopifolia, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, spiny fruits known as achenes. It is often used in erosion control due to its extensive root system and ability to thrive in poor soils. Centaurea coronopifolia is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness."
