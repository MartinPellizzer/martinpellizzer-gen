    "intro": "Carex turrita var. turrita, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its flowering structures consist of male and female flowers arranged in separate spikes, a common feature in sedges. The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
