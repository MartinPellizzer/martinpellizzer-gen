    "intro": "Cyrtochilum macasense, commonly known as the Macas orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, hairy pseudobulbs and linear, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyrtochilum macasense is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
