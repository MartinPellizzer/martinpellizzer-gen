    "intro": "Chaetostichium minimum var. microchaetum, commonly known as the small-hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It features fine, slender blades with short, dense hairs along the leaf surfaces, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
