    "intro": "Colchicum stenopetalum, commonly known as the narrow-petaled autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It produces striking, violet-blue flowers with narrow, petal-like bracts that resemble petals, giving it its common name. The plant typically blooms in late summer to early autumn, often after the foliage has emerged. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a rosette near the ground. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
