    "intro": "Coronilla repanda var. arenivaga, commonly known as the sand-coral or desert coronilla, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve fertility."
