    "intro": "Chlorocyperus serotinus, commonly known as the late-flowering flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered at the ends of its stems. Chlorocyperus serotinus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
