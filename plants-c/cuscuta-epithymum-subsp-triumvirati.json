    "intro": "Cuscuta epithymum subsp. triumvirati, commonly known as the redstem dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle involving both sexual and asexual reproduction. The plant is characterized by its slender, yellow stems that twine around its host, often forming dense mats. It is native to various regions in the Americas and is commonly found on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its botanical significance lies in its unique parasitic adaptations and its role in ecological interactions within its habitat."
