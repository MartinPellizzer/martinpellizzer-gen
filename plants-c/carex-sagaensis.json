    "intro": "Carex sagaensis, commonly known as the Saga sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, consist of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are wind-pollinated. Carex sagaensis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
