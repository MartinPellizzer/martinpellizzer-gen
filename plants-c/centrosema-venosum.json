    "intro": "Centrosema venosum, commonly known as the veiny crownflower, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland and riparian areas. It has a shallow root system and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Centrosema venosum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and can be grown as a garden plant."
