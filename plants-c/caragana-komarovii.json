It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in arid and semi-arid regions with poor soil conditions. Its roots have nitrogen-fixing capabilities, which improve soil fertility. Caragana komarovii is often used in reclamation projects due to its hardiness and ability to prevent soil erosion."
