    "intro": "Cajanus rugosus, commonly known as rough cluster bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its nutritional seeds. Cajanus rugosus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
