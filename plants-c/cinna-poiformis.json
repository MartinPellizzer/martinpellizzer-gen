It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are followed by orange-red berries. Cinna poiformis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
