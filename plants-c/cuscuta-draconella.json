    "intro": "Cuscuta draconella, commonly known as the dragon's whip, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure that wraps around its host to extract water and nutrients. The plant is native to regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, where it often infests crops and wild plants. Its life cycle involves germinating seeds and establishing a connection with the host's vascular system. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural plants."
