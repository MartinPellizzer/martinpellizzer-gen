    "intro": "Cytisus purpureus var. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered broom, is a flowering shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, thorned stems and compound leaves composed of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. This variety is distinct from the typical Cytisus purpureus due to its pale, almost white floral coloration."
