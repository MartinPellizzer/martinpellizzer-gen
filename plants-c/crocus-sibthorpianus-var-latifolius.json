    "intro": "Crocus sibthorpianus var. latifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It produces striking violet or purple flowers with a distinctive, recurved shape, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant features lanceolate, broad leaves that are often hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming habit, adding color to gardens during the transition from summer to fall."
