    "intro": "Carex neglecta, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Carex neglecta produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear greenish-yellow flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
