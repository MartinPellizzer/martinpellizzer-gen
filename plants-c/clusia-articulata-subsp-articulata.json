    "intro": "Clusia articulata subsp. articulata, commonly known as the \"shiny leaf waxplant,\" is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, which help reduce water loss in its humid, tropical environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, followed by yellowish fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in shaded conditions. Clusia articulata subsp. articulata is also valued for its use in traditional medicine in some regions."
