    "intro": "Castilleja leschkeana, commonly known as the Leschke's paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon, where it thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and chaparral. The plant has slender, erect stems and is characterized by its showy, red to orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to the roots of neighboring plants to extract water and nutrients. Castilleja leschkeana plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
