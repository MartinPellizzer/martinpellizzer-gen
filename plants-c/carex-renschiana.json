    "intro": "Carex renschiana, commonly known as the Rensch's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of eastern North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers. Carex renschiana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
