    "intro": "Cousinia acanthostephana, commonly known as the spiked cushion flower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit, forming compact cushions of foliage. The plant produces small, pink to purple flower heads that bloom in the summer, adding a splash of color to its rocky habitat. It has adapted to harsh environments with its hairy leaves and deep root system, which help conserve moisture. Cousinia acanthostephana is often found in alpine and arctic regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun."
