    "intro": "Castilleja parviflora var. californica, commonly known as the California paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant features bright red to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and coastal dunes. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
