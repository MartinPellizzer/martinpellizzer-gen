    "intro": "Coeloneurum eggersii, commonly known as the Eggers' spider orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its intricate, spider-like floral structure, which features a slender, twisted column and elongated, hairy sepals. Its flowers are typically pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinctive, recurved lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Coeloneurum eggersii is considered vulnerable and is often protected in conservation efforts."
