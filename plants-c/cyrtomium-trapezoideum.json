    "intro": "Cyrtomium trapezoideum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its unique leaf morphology and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
