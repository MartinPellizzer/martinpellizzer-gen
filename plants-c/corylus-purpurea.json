    "intro": "Corylus purpurea, commonly known as the purple hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the Corylaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and alternate, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces catkins in early spring, with male and female flowers on separate plants. Its edible nuts, encased in a spiny husk, mature in late summer and are an important food source for wildlife. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in forest understories."
