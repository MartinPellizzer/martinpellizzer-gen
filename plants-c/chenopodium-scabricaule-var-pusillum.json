    "intro": "Chenopodium scabricaule var. pusillum, commonly known as dwarf goosefoot, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine, sand-like texture, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by rounded, bead-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to harsh environments, contributing to its ecological resilience."
