    "intro": "Crotalaria prostrata var. nigrisperma, commonly known as blackseed cowpea, is a low-growing annual herb native to tropical regions. It features prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated pods containing numerous dark, oblong seeds. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a rough texture and prominent veins. This species is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
