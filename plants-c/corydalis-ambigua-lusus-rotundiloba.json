    "intro": "Corydalis ambigua lusus rotundiloba, commonly known as the rounded-lobed larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically range in color from blue to purple. The plant has basal leaves that are rounded and lobed, giving it its common name, and it produces slender, hairy stems that bear clusters of small flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can be toxic if ingested."
