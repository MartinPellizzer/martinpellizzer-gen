    "intro": "Cryptoceras pauciflorum, commonly known as the rare moonflower, is a unique member of the Araceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its striking, nocturnal-opening white flowers that emit a sweet fragrance. Its leaves are large, arrow-shaped, and often have a waxy texture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
