    "intro": "Corynephorus canescens f. pallidus, commonly known as the pale hairgrass, is a variant of the hairgrass species native to various regions of the Americas. It is a perennial grass characterized by its fine, silver-green blades that are typically shorter than the typical form. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows or along the edges of water bodies. Its pale coloration and delicate appearance make it a distinctive ornamental and ecological plant."
