    "intro": "Carlina bollei, commonly known as the Bolli's thistle, is a striking perennial plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a tall, upright stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, silver-gray, spiky leaves. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers with purple-blue petals and a prominent yellow central disk, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Carlina bollei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
