    "intro": "Cleisostoma auriculatum, commonly known as the golden ear orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features small, pendant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, with a distinctive auriculate (ear-like) lip. The plant has a compact growth habit, with a short, thick rhizome and dense clusters of leaves. Its flowers bloom during the rainy season, often in summer, and are pollinated by insects. The orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
