    "intro": "Campanula oblongifolioides, commonly known as the broad-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are broadly ovate to elliptical, often with a slightly wavy margin, and are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
