    "intro": "Cestrum chiapense, commonly known as the Chiapas trumpet flower, is a species of flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to deep red. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by nocturnal pollinators such as moths, and the plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Cestrum chiapense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
