It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly fuzzy leaves and small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and prefers well-drained, rocky soils. Its fragrant foliage contains essential oils, which contribute to its use in traditional medicine. Calamintha nivea is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in sunny, dry conditions."
