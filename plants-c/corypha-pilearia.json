    "intro": "Corypha pilearia, commonly known as the mountain cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. The plant features a stout, unbranched trunk that is often covered in a fibrous, spongy layer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with long, narrow leaflets that give it a feathery appearance. Due to its limited distribution and slow growth, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural habitat."
