    "intro": "Cheilanthes apiacea, commonly known as the rock fern or the mountain rock fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a perennial plant that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often growing on cliffs or in crevices. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with upright, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Cheilanthes apiacea is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient and hardy species."
