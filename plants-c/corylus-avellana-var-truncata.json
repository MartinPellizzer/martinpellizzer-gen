    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. truncata, commonly known as the truncated hazel, is a variant of the common hazel characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. Its leaves are typically shorter and broader than those of the standard variety, with a truncate or notched base. This plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. It produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, similar to other hazel species. The truncated hazel is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
