    "intro": "Ctenitis microchlaena, commonly known as the small-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Ctenitis microchlaena is native to Southeast Asia and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticultural settings."
