    "intro": "Connaropsis sericea, commonly known as silky connar, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Indian Ocean islands. It is characterized by its smooth, silvery-gray bark and lance-shaped, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Connaropsis sericea is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand periods of drought."
