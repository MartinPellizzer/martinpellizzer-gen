    "intro": "Celsia alpina, commonly known as the alpine celsia, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing white or pale pink petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, adapted to withstand cold and harsh alpine conditions. Celsia alpina thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats at high elevations."
