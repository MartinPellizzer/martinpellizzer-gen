    "intro": "Casearia ilicifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf casearia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
