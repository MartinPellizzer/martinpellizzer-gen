    "intro": "Cynosurus rupestris, commonly known as rock sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open, sunny habitats such as cliffs, heaths, and coastal areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish or brownish in color. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in poor soils and its resilience to harsh environmental conditions. Cynosurus rupestris plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
