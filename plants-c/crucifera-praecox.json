    "intro": "Crucifera praecox, commonly known as early cabbage, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of lanceolate, glaucous leaves and small, four-petaled flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant produces siliques, which are elongated pods containing numerous small, round seeds. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some areas."
