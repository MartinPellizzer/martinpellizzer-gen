    "intro": "Crassula quadrangularis, commonly known as the Jade Plant or Money Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It has thick, fleshy, four-sided stems that are typically green or variegated with white or pink markings. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are oval and glossy, and it is often grown as a houseplant due to its low maintenance requirements. Crassula quadrangularis is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems and leaves to survive periods of drought."
