It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, delicate flowers that resemble those of the true crocuses. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
