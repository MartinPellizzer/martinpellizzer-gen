    "intro": "Capnoides scouleri, commonly known as the Scouler's capillary, is a herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its leaves are finely divided and often have a mild, aromatic scent, while its flowers are clustered in umbels, a common feature of the Apiaceae family. Capnoides scouleri is valued for its ecological role in supporting local insect populations and its historical use by Indigenous peoples."
