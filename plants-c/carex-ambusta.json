    "intro": "Carex ambusta, commonly known as slender marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist soils in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. Carex ambusta thrives in full to partial sun and is often found in marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
