    "intro": "Campanula pallidiflora, commonly known as the pale-flowered bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, pale blue or white flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Campanula pallidiflora is valued for its ornamental beauty and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
