    "intro": "Campanula mirabilis var. aureomarginata, commonly known as the golden-margin bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, with a distinctive golden-yellow margin around the edges. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring through early summer."
