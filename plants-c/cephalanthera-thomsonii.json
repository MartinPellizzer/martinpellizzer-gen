    "intro": "Cephalanthera thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and a striking inflorescence of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that resemble a cascade of small, delicate trusses. The plant is a mycoheterotroph, meaning it obtains most of its nutrients through a symbiotic relationship with fungi rather than through photosynthesis. It typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with coniferous forests. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
