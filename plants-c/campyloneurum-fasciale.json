    "intro": "Campyloneurum fasciale, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, golden hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of its leaves. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant."
