    "intro": "Cassine ehrenbergii, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically yellow-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in brackish or saline water, often found in mangrove swamps and coastal areas. Its adaptability to wet, coastal environments makes it an important component of these ecosystems."
