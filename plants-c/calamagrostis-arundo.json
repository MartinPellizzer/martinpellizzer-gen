    "intro": "Calamagrostis arundo, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and long, narrow leaves that are often gray-green in color. The plant produces feathery panicles of small, pale green to golden-yellow flowers in the summer months. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and pond edges. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, it is often considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
