    "intro": "Celtis crassifolia var. tiliifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf boxwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, oval-shaped leaves that are typically 2\u20135 inches long and have a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by spherical, blue-black berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its compact growth and ornamental value. The varietal name *tiliifolia* refers to its leaf structure, which resembles that of the genus *Tilia*."
