    "intro": "Corispermum candelabrum, commonly known as the candlestick sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is a low-growing annual herb with a distinctive branched stem that resembles a candlestick, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by pale green, bead-like fruits. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Corispermum candelabrum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
