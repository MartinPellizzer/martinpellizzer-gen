It is characterized by its twisted, often gnarled branches and small, thorned stems. The plant produces white or pink flowers in spring, followed by red or orange berries in the autumn. Its leaves are typically oval with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Crataegus tortilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique form and seasonal interest."
