    "intro": "Cardamine belgaumensis, commonly known as the Belgaum watercress, is a small flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small white or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
