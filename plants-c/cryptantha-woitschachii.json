    "intro": "Cryptantha woitschachii, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It has a compact growth habit with hairy stems and leaves that help reduce water loss. Cryptantha woitschachii is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
