    "intro": "Catasetum variabile, commonly known as the variable catasetum, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, often colorful flowers that can range from yellow to orange and red, with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its inflorescence is usually a raceme of showy, resupinate flowers, and it produces a unique, sticky pollination structure called a galea. Catasetum variabile is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and distinctive floral morphology."
