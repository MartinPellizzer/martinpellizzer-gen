    "intro": "Cyclandrophora travancorica, commonly known as the Travancore sandalwood, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense undergrowth of tropical forests. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered endangered and is protected under Indian environmental laws. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptation to the specific ecological conditions of its native region."
