    "intro": "Carex hyperborea var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf bog sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as bogs, fens, and marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it plays an important role in wetland ecosystems. This variety is characterized by its slender foliage and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils."
