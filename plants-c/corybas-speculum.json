    "intro": "Corybas speculum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) native to New Zealand. It is a terrestrial herb with a distinctive, hooded flower that resembles a small, ghostly face, hence its common name. The plant produces a single, showy flower that is typically white or pale green, with intricate patterns on its petals and sepals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
