    "intro": "Coleosanthus humilis, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a species of cycad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slow growth and distinctive, palm-like foliage composed of long, narrow leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, a feature typical of cycads, and has a unique reproductive system involving both male and female cones. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
