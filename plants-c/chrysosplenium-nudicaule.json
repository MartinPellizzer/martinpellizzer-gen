    "intro": "Chrysosplenium nudicaule, commonly known as the naked-stem sedum, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Saxifragaceae. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens as a ground cover plant."
