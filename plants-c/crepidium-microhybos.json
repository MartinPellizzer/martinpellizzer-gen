    "intro": "Crepidium microhybos, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid species native to the wetlands and marshes of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10-20 centimeters, with slender, grass-like leaves and a single, delicate flower that is usually white or pale green. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soil and requires a humid environment to flourish."
