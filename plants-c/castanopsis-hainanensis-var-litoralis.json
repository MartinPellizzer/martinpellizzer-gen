    "intro": "Castanopsis hainanensis var. litoralis, commonly known as the coastal castanopsis, is a rare evergreen tree native to the southern coastal regions of Hainan Island, China. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand saline and wind conditions. The plant produces small, woody fruits containing single seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water. It thrives in sandy or rocky coastal soils and plays a vital role in stabilizing dune ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
