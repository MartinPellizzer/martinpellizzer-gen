It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has cylindrical, grass-like leaves that are usually covered in a grayish-white bloom, giving it its common name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
