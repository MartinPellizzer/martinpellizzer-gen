    "intro": "Calamus insignis var. longispinosus, commonly known as the long-spined calamus, is a member of the Aroid family (Araceae). It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine, spiny hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces an inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This variant is noted for its unique spiny structures, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
