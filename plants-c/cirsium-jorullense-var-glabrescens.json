    "intro": "Cirsium jorullense var. glabrescens, commonly known as the Jorullense thistle, is a perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which become less prominent as the plant matures. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky soils and open fields. This variety is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
