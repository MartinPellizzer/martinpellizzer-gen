    "intro": "Cinchona moritziana, commonly known as the Moritz's quinine tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is closely related to other cinchona species used for producing quinine. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its bark contains alkaloids, including quinine, which has historically been used in medicine. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
