    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris lobulata, commonly known as the common chickweed or mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It features small, white flowers with four petals and is characterized by its lobed, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. Its seed pods, which resemble a small pouch, are a distinctive feature and aid in seed dispersal. This species is often considered a weed but also has historical uses in herbal medicine."
