    "intro": "Critesion murinum, commonly known as the mouse ear cress, is a small annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of oval, fleshy leaves that resemble a mouse's ears, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically arranged in a raceme. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, roadsides, and waste areas. Critesion murinum is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, making it both a common weed and a model organism in plant biology research."
