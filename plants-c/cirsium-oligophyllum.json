    "intro": "Cirsium oligophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its spiny, purple flowers and narrow, silver-green leaves with a fuzzy texture. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Cirsium oligophyllum is often considered a hardy plant with low maintenance requirements, making it suitable for ecological restoration projects."
