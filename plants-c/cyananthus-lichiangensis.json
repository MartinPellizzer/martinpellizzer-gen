    "intro": "Cyananthus lichiangensis, commonly known as the Lijiang blueflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, often in moist, shaded environments, and is adapted to the cool climate of its native habitat. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves, and it is often found in forested areas with rich organic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
