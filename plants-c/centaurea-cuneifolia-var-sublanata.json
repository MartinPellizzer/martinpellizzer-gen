    "intro": "Centaurea cuneifolia var. sublanata, commonly known as the woolly narrowleaf star-thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in dense, white to grayish hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces bright purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
