    "intro": "Claoxylon schweinfurthii, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to regions of Africa. It is characterized by its straight, durable wood, which is highly valued in the timber industry. The plant has a dense canopy and can grow up to 30 meters tall, with compound leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is also listed as a vulnerable species in some conservation assessments."
