    "intro": "Corispermum ulopterum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, pale green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, round seeds enclosed in a hard, membranous capsule. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Corispermum ulopterum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
