    "intro": "Cousinia malurensis, commonly known as the Malurensis globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features a sturdy, upright stem covered in dense, woolly hairs, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a similar fuzzy coating, aiding in water conservation. The showy yellow to orange flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
