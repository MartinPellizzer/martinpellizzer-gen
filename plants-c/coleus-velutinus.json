    "intro": "Coleus velutinus, commonly known as velvetleaf coleus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its velvety, hairy foliage that gives it its common name. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and come in a variety of colors, including shades of green, red, and purple. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil. This ornamental plant is often grown for its attractive foliage rather than its flowers."
