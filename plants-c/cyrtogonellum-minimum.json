    "intro": "Cyrtogonellum minimum, commonly known as the dwarf bellflower, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few inches, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and small container plantings. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant landscapes."
