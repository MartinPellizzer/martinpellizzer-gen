    "intro": "Cactus jansenianus, commonly known as the Jansen's cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical stems and spiny, ribbed structure. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted for water storage, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. Cactus jansenianus is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xerophytic gardens."
