It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to pink, often with a contrasting white throat. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the base. It produces bulbous underground storage organs, which are essential for its survival and propagation. This species is well adapted to dry conditions and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
