    "intro": "Calluna erica var. condensata, commonly known as the heath rose or dense heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to western Europe. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late summer. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in compact, mat-like formations. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and moorlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form dense, long-lasting ground cover."
