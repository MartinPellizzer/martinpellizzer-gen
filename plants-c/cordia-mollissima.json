    "intro": "Cordia mollissima, commonly known as silky cordia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, silvery-green bark and opposite, ovate leaves with a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid lowland areas. Cordia mollissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local medicine."
