This plant is characterized by its large, broad, and glossy green leaves that are arranged in a dense, fan-like pattern. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia, where it thrives in tropical climates. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for many decades, making it a long-lived ornamental species. Its cycad-like structure and striking foliage make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and private collections."
