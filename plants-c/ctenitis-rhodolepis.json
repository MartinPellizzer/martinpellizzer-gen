    "intro": "Ctenitis rhodolepis, commonly known as the red-stemmed tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing both spores and sexual structures on the same plant. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist, shaded environments. Ctenitis rhodolepis is often found in humid forests, where it thrives in the understory with high humidity and partial shade."
