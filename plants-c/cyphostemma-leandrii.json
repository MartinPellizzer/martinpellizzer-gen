    "intro": "Cyphostemma leandrii, commonly known as the African moon vine, is a climbing shrub native to southern Africa. It features thin, woody stems that can reach lengths of several meters, often trailing or climbing over other vegetation. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for humans and animals. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Cyphostemma leandrii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry regions."
