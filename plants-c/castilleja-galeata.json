    "intro": "Castilleja galeata, commonly known as the pale Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on host plants for some of its nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Castilleja galeata plays an important role in pollination and is often found in association with other native flora."
