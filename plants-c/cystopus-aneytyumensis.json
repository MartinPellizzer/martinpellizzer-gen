    "intro": "Cystopus aneytyumensis, commonly known as the African horned lily, is a striking perennial plant native to the grasslands of southern Africa. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a yellow or orange throat. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a tall, erect stem that bears the floral display. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water. Cystopus aneytyumensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
