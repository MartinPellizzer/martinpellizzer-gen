    "intro": "Cunila polyantha, commonly known as sweet cicely, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features aromatic, fern-like leaves and small, white, umbel-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, round, black seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Cunila polyantha is often grown for its edible leaves and seeds, which have a mild, anise-like flavor."
