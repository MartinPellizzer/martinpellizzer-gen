    "intro": "Calylophus tubicula, commonly known as the tube-tongue orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a long, tubular spur that serves as a nectar reservoir. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually small and pale, often displaying a delicate pink or white hue. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calylophus tubicula is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
