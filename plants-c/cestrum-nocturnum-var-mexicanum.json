    "intro": "Cestrum nocturnum var. mexicanum, commonly known as nightshade or Mexican cestrum, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and night-time fragrance."
