    "intro": "Chamaecrista trachycarpa, commonly known as the rough pod bean, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, woody pods that are covered in stiff, bristly hairs. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along desert margins. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance."
