    "intro": "Cystopteris obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaf moonwort, is a fern species native to North America. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, broad, and often lobed fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Cystopteris obtusa is notable for its ornamental value and its role in ecological systems where it contributes to soil stability and habitat diversity."
