It features small, hairy leaves that are typically glabrous, or hairless, in this variety, giving it a smooth texture. The plant produces clusters of white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Cerastium alpinum var. glabrum is often found in mountain meadows and is a characteristic component of alpine flora."
