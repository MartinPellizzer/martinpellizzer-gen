    "intro": "Centaurea nigrescens subsp. ramosa, commonly known as the ramose bluemink, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its branching structure, which gives it a more open and airy appearance compared to other Centaurea species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable plant for rock gardens and dry landscapes. This plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
