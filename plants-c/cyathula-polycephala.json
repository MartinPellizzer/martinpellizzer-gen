It is characterized by its distinctive, clustered inflorescence that resembles a cup or urn, known as a cyathium. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Cyathula polycephala typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
