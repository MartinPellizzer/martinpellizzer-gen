    "intro": "Clidemia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf wood sorrel, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves that can be simple or compound, and often exhibit a wide range of shapes and sizes. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Clidemia heterophylla is also known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it an invasive species in some regions."
