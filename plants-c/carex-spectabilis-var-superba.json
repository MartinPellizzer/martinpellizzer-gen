It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its tall, grass-like foliage and distinctive flowering spikes. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are usually bright green, and the inflorescence consists of cylindrical clusters of small, white or pale brown flowers. It is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
