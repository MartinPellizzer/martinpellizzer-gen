    "intro": "Crataegus rotundifolia, commonly known as the roundleaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its oval, rounded leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible for birds but generally unpalatable to humans. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. Crataegus rotundifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
