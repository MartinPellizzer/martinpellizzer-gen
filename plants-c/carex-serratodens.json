    "intro": "Carex serratodens, commonly known as the saw-toothed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it produces three-sided, fibrous seeds. Carex serratodens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
