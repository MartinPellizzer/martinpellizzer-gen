    "intro": "Castilleja aquariensis, commonly known as the aquatic castilleja, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of California. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant features showy, red to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically small and alternate, and it grows in wetland or riparian habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of ecosystem health."
