    "intro": "Colpodium leucolepis, commonly known as the white-stemmed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its slender, white stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms. This plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are whorled and often reduced to small, scale-like structures. Colpodium leucolepis is a carnivorous plant that uses its bladders to capture and digest prey, supplementing its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor water."
