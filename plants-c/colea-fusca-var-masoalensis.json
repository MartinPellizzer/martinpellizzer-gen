    "intro": "Colea fusca var. masoalensis, commonly known as the Masoalensis Colea, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its fruit is a small capsule containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
