It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruits are capsules that release seeds when mature, contributing to its propagation in suitable habitats. It is often found in savannas and woodland areas, thriving in well-drained soils."
