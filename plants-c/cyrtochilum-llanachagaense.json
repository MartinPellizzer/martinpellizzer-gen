It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces greenish-white or pale yellow blooms with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
