It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves, which are usually opposite or alternate in arrangement. The flowers are typically showy, with bilateral symmetry and often brightly colored petals. Cardiolepis species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa and southern Asia. They thrive in moist, well-drained soils and are often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
