It is characterized by its distinctive stipules, which are leaf-like structures at the base of the leaf stalks. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from white to pink. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
