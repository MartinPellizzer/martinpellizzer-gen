    "intro": "Corylus intermedia, commonly known as the hazel nut or intermediate hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Betulaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and catkin-like flowers. The plant produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, which ripen in the autumn. Corylus intermedia is often found in woodland edges and moist soils, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife. Its ornamental value and edible yield make it a valued plant in both horticulture and agriculture."
