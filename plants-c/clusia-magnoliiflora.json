    "intro": "Clusia magnoliiflora, commonly known as the waxleaf clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, dark green leaves that are often variegated with yellow or white margins. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. These flowers are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Clusia magnoliiflora is well adapted to humid, tropical climates and is often used as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage."
