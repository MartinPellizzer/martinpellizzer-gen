    "intro": "Coscinium wightianum, commonly known as the Indian black nightshade, is a climbing shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades and tomatoes. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are toxic to humans but are used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are often used in Ayurvedic practices for their purported medicinal properties. The plant's rapid growth and invasive potential make it a concern in some regions."
