    "intro": "Cola itambensis, commonly known as Itamb\u00e9, is a species of the Sterculiaceae family native to western Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, with a dense canopy and smooth, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by round, green fruits that turn red when mature. Each fruit contains several hard, dark seeds, which are the primary source of caffeine and other alkaloids. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional uses in local cultures."
