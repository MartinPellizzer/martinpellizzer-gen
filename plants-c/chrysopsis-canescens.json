    "intro": "Chrysopsis canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typically herbaceous growth habit. The plant features narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are yellow and appear in clusters, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Chrysopsis canescens is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert habitats."
