    "intro": "Coffea canephora var. hinaultii, commonly known as the \"Hinaultii\" variety, is a rare and less commercially cultivated subspecies of robusta coffee. It is native to the high altitudes of western Africa, particularly in countries like Cameroon and Gabon. This variety is characterized by its small, oval-shaped beans and a distinct, earthy flavor profile. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soils. Due to its limited cultivation, it is often considered a specialty or heirloom coffee variety."
