    "intro": "Conostomium natalense var. glabrum, commonly known as Natal flatweed, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range."
