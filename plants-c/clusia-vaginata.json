    "intro": "Clusia vaginata, commonly known as the waxleaf clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, providing a striking visual appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing several seeds. Clusia vaginata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its ability to thrive in shaded environments and its tolerance to various soil conditions. It is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and ability to thrive in low-light settings."
