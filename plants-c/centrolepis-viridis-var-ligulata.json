It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, inconspicuous flowers. It is native to southern Africa and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its distinctive morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
