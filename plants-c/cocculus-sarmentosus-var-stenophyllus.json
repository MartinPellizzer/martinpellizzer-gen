    "intro": "Cocculus sarmentosus var. stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed devil's backbone, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by spiny, berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
