    "intro": "Chenopodium \u00d7 hungaricum, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae. It is an annual herbaceous plant characterized by its prickly stems and leaves, which are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences called tumbleweeds. It is native to Europe and Asia but has been introduced to many other regions, often becoming an invasive species. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it a common weed in agricultural and natural areas."
