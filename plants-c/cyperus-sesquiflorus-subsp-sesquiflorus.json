    "intro": "Cyperus sesquiflorus subsp. sesquiflorus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedgeland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to brown flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. It is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils, making it an indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
