    "intro": "Croton leucophyllus var. leucophyllus, commonly known as the white-leaf croton, is a striking ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, white to pale green leaves that contrast beautifully with its dark green stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers, which are followed by woody, spiny capsules containing seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique foliage, it is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
