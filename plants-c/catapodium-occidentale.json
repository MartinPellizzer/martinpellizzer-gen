    "intro": "Catapodium occidentale, commonly known as western galleta, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in desert or semi-desert environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight bluish tint, and it is well adapted to drought conditions. Catapodium occidentale plays an important ecological role by providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
