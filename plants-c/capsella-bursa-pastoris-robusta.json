    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris robusta, commonly known as the common chickweed or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is an annual herb characterized by its small, pale green leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive heart-shaped structure called a silique, which aids in seed dispersal. The species is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas quickly."
