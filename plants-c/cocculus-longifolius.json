    "intro": "Cocculus longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved devil's bit, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by distinctive, spiny fruits that contain single, elongated seeds. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study. However, it is important to note that some species within this genus can be toxic, requiring caution in handling or consumption."
