    "intro": "Calymmodon oligotrichus, commonly known as the slender thornapple, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, spiny fruits and distinctive foliage. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showing adaptability to dry conditions. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, and it produces small, oval-shaped berries that contain seeds. Due to its thorny structure and potential toxicity, it is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats."
