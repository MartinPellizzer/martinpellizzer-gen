It is characterized by its trailing stems and distinctive, fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and hanging baskets.
