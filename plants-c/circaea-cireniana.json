    "intro": "Circaea cireniana, commonly known as the white sand gentian, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and stream banks. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
