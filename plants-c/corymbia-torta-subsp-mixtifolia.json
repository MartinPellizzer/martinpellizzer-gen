    "intro": "Corymbia torta subsp. mixtifolia, commonly known as the mixed-leaf bloodwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that vary in size and shape, often appearing mixed on the same tree. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, producing a distinctive honey-scented fragrance. This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a high degree of drought tolerance. It is also valued for its hard, durable wood and is sometimes used in traditional Aboriginal practices."
