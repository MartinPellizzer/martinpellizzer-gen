    "intro": "Claoxylon humblotianum, commonly known as the Malayan ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
