    "intro": "Caesalpinia acutifolia, commonly known as the flame tree or fire tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its bright orange to red, flame-like inflorescences that bloom during the dry season. The plant has bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small leaflets, and its flowers are often visited by birds and insects. The fruit is a woody pod that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its striking appearance. Caesalpinia acutifolia is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in providing habitat for wildlife."
