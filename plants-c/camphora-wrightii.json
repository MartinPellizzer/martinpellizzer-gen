    "intro": "Camphora wrightii, commonly known as the Mexican camphor tree, is a deciduous tree native to central Mexico. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, rough bark and simple, alternate leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by oval, woody fruits containing single seeds. Its essential oils, particularly camphor, have been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent. The plant is also valued for its ability to thrive in rocky soils and its role in local ecosystems."
