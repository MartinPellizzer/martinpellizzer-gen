These plants are typically found in wetland and coastal environments, where they thrive in moist or saline soils. Chamaeschoenus species are characterized by their grass-like appearance, with narrow leaves and spike-like flower clusters. They play an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife. Some species are also used in ecological restoration projects due to their hardiness and adaptability."
