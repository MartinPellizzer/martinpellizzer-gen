    "intro": "Cocos macrocarpa, commonly known as the coconut palm, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces a distinctive fruit, the coconut, which contains both a liquid endosperm and a hard, fibrous shell. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in coastal and sandy soils. The coconut palm plays a significant role in both ecological and economic systems in tropical regions."
