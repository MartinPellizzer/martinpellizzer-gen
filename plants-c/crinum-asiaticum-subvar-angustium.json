It features strap-shaped, narrow leaves that are usually dark green and slightly glossy. The plant produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
