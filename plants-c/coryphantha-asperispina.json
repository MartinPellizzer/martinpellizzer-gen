    "intro": "Coryphantha asperispina, commonly known as the rough spine cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, spiny areoles, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it a notable species within the Cactaceae family, valued for both its ecological role and ornamental appeal."
