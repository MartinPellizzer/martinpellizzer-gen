    "intro": "Celastrus punctatus, commonly known as the spotted elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Celastraceae family and is characterized by its opposite, simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by clusters of bright red berries that mature in the fall. These berries are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife species. The plant is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role."
