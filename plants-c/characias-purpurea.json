    "intro": "Characias purpurea, commonly known as the purple fountain grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features tall, slender stems that produce dense, feathery plumes of purple or pink flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a landscape accent. Its striking appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
