    "intro": "Carex quadrangulata, commonly known as the four-cornered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with male and female flowers often occurring on separate spikes."
