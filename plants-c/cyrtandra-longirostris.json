    "intro": "Cyrtandra longirostris, commonly known as the long-beaked cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their nectar-rich structure. Cyrtandra longirostris is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
