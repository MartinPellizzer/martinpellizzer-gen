    "intro": "Codda-pana, commonly known as the African butter tree, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, fleshy fruits resembling large berries. Its roots are known for their ability to fix nitrogen, enriching the soil. Codda-pana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and unique appearance."
