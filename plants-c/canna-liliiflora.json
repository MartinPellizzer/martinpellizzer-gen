It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, which are a vibrant green with a waxy texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for water gardens and tropical landscapes. Canna liliiflora is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
