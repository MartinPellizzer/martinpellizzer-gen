    "intro": "Corysanthes fordhamii, commonly known as the Fordham's candlewood, is a unique and rare plant native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its striking, candle-like inflorescences that emit a sweet, fragrant aroma. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks of trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, and it produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat destruction and climate change."
