    "intro": "Caladium cupreum, commonly known as the copperleaf, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped leaves that come in shades of red, orange, and copper, which intensify in color as the plant matures. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and prefers well-draining soil with consistent moisture. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its dramatic foliage rather than its small, inconspicuous flowers. Caladium cupreum is a perennial in USDA hardiness zones 9-11, but it is typically grown as an annual in cooler climates."
