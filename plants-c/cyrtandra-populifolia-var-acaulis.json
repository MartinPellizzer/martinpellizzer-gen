    "intro": "Cyrtandra populifolia var. acaulis, commonly known as the tree cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its broad, maple-like leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its flowers are clustered in inflorescences and are usually white or pale blue in color. This variant is distinguished by its lack of a caudex, a feature that sets it apart from other varieties within the Cyrtandra genus."
