It features tall, unbranched stems with large, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in late summer. Its roots and rhizomes are the primary parts used in herbal medicine. It thrives in moist, shady woodland habitats and is valued for its historical use in treating menstrual disorders and menopausal symptoms."
