    "intro": "Cyclamen poli, commonly known as the Persian cyclamen, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and western Asia. It features heart-shaped, velvety foliage with a deep green color and produces delicate, spurred flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant has a corm-like tuberous root system that helps it survive in rocky, well-drained soils. Cyclamen poli thrives in cool, shady environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its blooming period typically occurs in late winter to early spring."
