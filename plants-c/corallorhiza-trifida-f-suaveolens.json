    "intro": "Corallorhiza trifida f. suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented coralroot, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a myco-heterotroph. This plant relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients, often forming symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. It produces small, pale yellow to reddish-brown flowers arranged in a spike, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to eastern North America and thrives in shaded, moist forest environments. Due to its reliance on specific fungi and habitat conditions, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
