    "intro": "Centrosema tetragonolobum, commonly known as the four-angled centrosema, is a leguminous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with four-angled stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by pea-like pods containing several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in agricultural systems for its nitrogen-fixing abilities. The species is also valued for its forage qualities and ecological benefits in tropical and subtropical regions."
