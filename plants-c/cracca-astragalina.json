    "intro": "Cracca astragalina, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. Its compound leaves are pinnately arranged, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Cracca astragalina plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
