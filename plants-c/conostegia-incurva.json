It is native to coastal regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in brackish water environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing a fragrant aroma that attracts pollinators. Conostegia incurva plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
