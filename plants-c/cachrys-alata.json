    "intro": "Cachrys alata, commonly known as the winged buckthorn, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, winged leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue berries in the fall. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. Cachrys alata thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests."
