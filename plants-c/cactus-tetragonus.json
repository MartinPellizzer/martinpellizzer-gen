    "intro": "Cactus tetragonus, commonly known as the four-angle cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive four-sided stems that are ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically borne at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert environments. Its unique morphology and adaptations make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
