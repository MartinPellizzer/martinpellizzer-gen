    "intro": "Carex comari, commonly known as the common sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. Native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize new areas. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
