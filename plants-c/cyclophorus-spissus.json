    "intro": "Cyclophorus spissus, commonly known as the hairy cyclophorus, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and striking tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
