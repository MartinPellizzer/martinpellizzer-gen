    "intro": "Carex arenaria var. castanea, commonly known as the chestnut sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to reddish in color, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. It is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and wind. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy shorelines."
