    "intro": "Caricinella scabra, commonly known as the rough-hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is native to freshwater habitats in southern Africa, particularly in regions with slow-moving or still water. The plant is characterized by its short, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are typically reduced to scales, and it lacks true roots, relying on its stems for anchorage. Caricinella scabra is often found in muddy or sandy substrates and is an indicator species of nutrient-rich waters."
