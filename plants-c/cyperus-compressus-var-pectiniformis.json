It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, flat leaves that grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found in wetland habitats. This variant is distinguished by its broader leaf blades compared to the typical form of Cyperus compressus."
