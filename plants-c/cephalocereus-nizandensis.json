    "intro": "Cephalocereus nizandensis, commonly known as the Nizandensis cactus, is a species native to Mexico, specifically found in the state of Nayarit. It is a tall, columnar cactus with a distinctive crown of spiny, segmented stems that grow upward. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. The cactus is well adapted to arid environments, showcasing features typical of desert flora."
