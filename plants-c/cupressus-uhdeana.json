    "intro": "Cupressus uhdeana, commonly known as the Uhde's cypress, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the mountainous regions of southeastern China. It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, and it is often found in rocky or well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered a conservation priority. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying the evolution of cypress-like plants in Asia."
