    "intro": "Centaurea julica, commonly known as the Juliana's coneflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its bright red to purple flowers, which are typically surrounded by yellow bracts. The plant grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Centaurea julica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
