    "intro": "Cissus macropa, commonly known as the large-leafed arrowroot or the climbing devil's ivy, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by distinctive, three-lobed fruits that turn red when mature. Its stems are woody and can climb using adventitious roots, allowing it to grow along trees or walls. Cissus macropa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
