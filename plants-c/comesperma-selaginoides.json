    "intro": "Comesperma selaginoides, commonly known as the coastal mistflower, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in areas subject to salt spray. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid or coastal conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
