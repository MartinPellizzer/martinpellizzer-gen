It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fragrant, resinous gum that has been used traditionally for medicinal and aromatic purposes. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Due to its unique resin and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
