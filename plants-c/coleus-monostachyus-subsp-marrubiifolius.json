    "intro": "Coleus monostachyus subsp. marrubiifolius, commonly known as the African coleus, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features striking, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive silver or white venation pattern, which gives it a unique ornamental appearance. The plant belongs to the Lamiaceae family, sharing characteristics with other members such as mint and sage. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm and produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in clusters. This subspecies is valued for its foliage rather than its flowers, making it a popular choice in gardens and as a houseplant."
