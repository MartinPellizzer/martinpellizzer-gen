    "intro": "Cyperus torosus, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found in coastal areas or near water bodies. Its slender, grass-like leaves are arranged in three rows, and it produces small, three-sided spikelets that are clustered at the ends of the stems. Cyperus torosus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
