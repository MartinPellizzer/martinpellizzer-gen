    "intro": "Chthonocephalus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale, translucent petals. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for photosynthesis, making it a hemiparasitic species. It thrives in nutrient-poor, wet environments and is highly sensitive to changes in its habitat. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is listed as an endangered species."
