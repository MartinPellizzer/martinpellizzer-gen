    "intro": "Camellia fraterna, commonly known as the Chinese camellia, is a species of flowering plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves and showy, camellia-like flowers that bloom in winter or early spring. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub in forested areas, preferring partial shade and well-drained soil. Camellia fraterna is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its long-lasting blooms. Its botanical significance also lies in its role as a parent species in the hybridization of many commercially important camellia varieties."
