    "intro": "Clematis vitalba var. acuminatissima, commonly known as the sharp-pointed old man's beard, is a variant of the European Clematis vitalba. It is a climbing vine characterized by its long, trailing stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets that are often hairy. This variety is distinguished by its more acute leaf tips compared to the standard form, giving it a more refined appearance. It thrives in woodland environments and is often found in shaded, moist areas across its native range."
