It is a member of the Boraginaceae family, characterized by its hairy stems and showy blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats such as meadows and slopes. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
