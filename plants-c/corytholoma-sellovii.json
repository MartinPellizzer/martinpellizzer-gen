    "intro": "Corytholoma sellovii, commonly known as the Sello's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the humid forests of western Africa. It is characterized by its striking, translucent, and often pinkish or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are relatively small but highly ornate, with intricate petal structures that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Corytholoma sellovii is considered a vulnerable species, making it a subject of interest for botanical conservation efforts."
