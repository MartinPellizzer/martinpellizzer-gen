    "intro": "Cydonia speciosa, commonly known as the European persimmon, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces large, orange to red fruits that are edible when fully ripe, characterized by a sweet, honey-like flavor. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated edges. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cold winter dormancy period for optimal fruit production. The flowers are yellowish-green with five petals and appear in clusters, often preceding the fruiting season."
