    "intro": "Candollea caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted fern or small-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its fronds are usually bright green and possess a soft, feathery texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Candollea caespitosa plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and serving as a food source for certain herbivorous species."
