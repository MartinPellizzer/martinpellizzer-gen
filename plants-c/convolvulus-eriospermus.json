    "intro": "Convolvulus eriospermus, commonly known as the hairy bindweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces small, pale yellow flowers with five petals. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in fields, roadsides, and along fences. The seeds are encased in a hairy, spiny capsule, aiding in its dispersal by wind or animals."
