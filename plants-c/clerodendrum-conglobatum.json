    "intro": "Clerodendrum conglobatum, commonly known as the clustered clefvea, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive reddish or purple underside. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by small, round, berry-like fruits that turn from green to red as they mature. Clerodendrum conglobatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
