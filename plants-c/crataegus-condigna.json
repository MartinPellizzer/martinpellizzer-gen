    "intro": "Crataegus condigna, commonly known as the sharpthorn hawthorn, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family, Rosaceae. It is native to the eastern United States and is characterized by its thorny stems and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries that are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally unpalatable to humans. Crataegus condigna is often found in woodlands, thickets, and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun. Its botanical features make it an important component of native ecosystems and a subject of interest in horticulture and ecological studies."
