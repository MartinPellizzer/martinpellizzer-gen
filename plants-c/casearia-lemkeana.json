It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by bright yellow berries, which are an important food source for birds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
