    "intro": "Chamaedaphne angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf leatherleaf, is a deciduous shrub native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It is characterized by its small, dark green, elliptical leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces tiny, clustered white flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in swamps and bogs. Its dense growth habit makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
