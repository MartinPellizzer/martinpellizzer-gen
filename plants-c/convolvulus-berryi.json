    "intro": "Convolvulus berryi, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in the morning and close by afternoon. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Convolvulus berryi is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
