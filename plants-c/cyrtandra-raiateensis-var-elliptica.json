    "intro": "Cyrtandra raiateensis var. elliptica, commonly known as the Tahitian false hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, lanceolate leaves that are often glossy and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale blue, with five lobes and a prominent throat. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal forests and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
