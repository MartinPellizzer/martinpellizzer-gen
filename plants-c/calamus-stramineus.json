    "intro": "Calamus stramineus, commonly known as the sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the Americas. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, though it is not a true palm. The plant is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and a rhizomatous root system that spreads horizontally underground. Its fragrant, aromatic rhizomes have been historically used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. The plant thrives in moist, swampy environments and is often found in association with other wetland flora."
