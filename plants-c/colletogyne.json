    "intro": "Colletogyne, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, purple, or white. They have a compact growth habit and are often found in sandy or rocky soils. Colletogyne species are adapted to drought conditions and are often used in xeriscaping due to their low water requirements."
