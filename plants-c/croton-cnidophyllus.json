    "intro": "Croton cnidophyllus, commonly known as the net-leaf croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that resemble a net, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental leaves and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
