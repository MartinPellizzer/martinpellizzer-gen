    "intro": "Cinnamomum taquetii, commonly known as the Madagascar cinnamon tree, is a small evergreen tree native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown bark that resembles cinnamon, though it is not related to true cinnamon. The plant produces small, white flowers and oblong, dark green leaves with a glossy surface. Its bark contains essential oils and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
