    "intro": "Cattleya \u00d7 dallei, commonly known as the Dallei Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid that originated from crosses between Cattleya labiata and Cattleya mossiae. It is characterized by its large, fragrant, and showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, well-lit environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in tropical and subtropical climates. The species is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and ease of cultivation."
