    "intro": "Cola congolana, commonly known as African cola, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly the Congo Basin, and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces distinctive yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing hard, seed-containing nuts. Its botanical features include a robust stem, hairy foliage, and a preference for well-drained, fertile soils. Cola congolana is often found in secondary forests and is valued for its seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a stimulant."
