    "intro": "Cytisus virens, commonly known as yellow broom, is a flowering shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often thorny stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and woodland edges. Cytisus virens is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other parts of the world for gardening purposes."
