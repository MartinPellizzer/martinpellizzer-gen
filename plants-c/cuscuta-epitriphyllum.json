    "intro": "Cuscuta epitriphyllum, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant's seeds are dispersed through the wind, and it can infest a variety of crops and wild plants. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, and it can significantly weaken or kill the host plant. Cuscuta epitriphyllum is found in temperate regions and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
