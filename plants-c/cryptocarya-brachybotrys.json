    "intro": "Cryptocarya brachybotrys, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cryptocarya, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface and a duller underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. Cryptocarya brachybotrys is often found in coastal scrub and forest margins, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
