    "intro": "Cleome postrata, commonly known as the sticky cleome, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features erect, branching stems covered with sticky hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and also bear the characteristic sticky coating. Cleome postrata is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
