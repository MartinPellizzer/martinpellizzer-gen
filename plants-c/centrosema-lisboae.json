    "intro": "Centrosema lisboae, commonly known as the Lisbon velvetbean, is a tropical leguminous plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with deep green, velvety foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing lens-shaped seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in agroforestry systems for soil enrichment. Centrosema lisboae is also valued for its ornamental appeal and potential in forage production."
