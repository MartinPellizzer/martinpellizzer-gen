    "intro": "Cyperus distans var. pseudonutans, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands. It is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils, making it a common wetland species."
