    "intro": "Cardamine intermedia subsp. antipodum, commonly known as the New Zealand watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils along stream banks and wetlands. This subspecies is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
