    "intro": "Chenopodium graveolens var. mexicanum, commonly known as Mexican Goosefoot, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its alternate, broadly ovate to rhombic leaves that are often pubescent and have a tangy, slightly spicy aroma. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, and its seeds are encased in a hard, triangular shell. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. This species is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a food source in some cultures."
