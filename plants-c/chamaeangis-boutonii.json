    "intro": "Chamaeangis boutonii, commonly known as the Bouton's chamaeangis, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Chamaeangis boutonii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
