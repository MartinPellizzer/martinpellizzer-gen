    "intro": "Chamaecytisus leiocarpus, commonly known as the silky cinquefoil, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a woody stem with a distinctive, flaky bark that peels away in thin layers. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, soft hairs that give it a silky texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and open areas."
