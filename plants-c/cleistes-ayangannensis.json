    "intro": "Cleistes ayangannensis, commonly known as the Ayangann bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its showy, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It has a short, creeping stem with opposite leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cleistes ayangannensis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
