    "intro": "Campylotropis microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved bentstem clover, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, winding stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it contributes to soil stabilization through its nitrogen-fixing abilities."
