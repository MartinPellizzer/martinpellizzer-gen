    "intro": "Castanea dentata, commonly known as the American chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The tree produces male and female flowers on the same plant, with the male flowers appearing in catkin-like clusters and the female flowers being small and inconspicuous. Its fruit is a spiny burr that contains one or two edible nuts, which are encased in a thick, hairy husk. Due to the chestnut blight, the species has been severely reduced in population, though efforts are ongoing to restore its ecological and economic importance."
