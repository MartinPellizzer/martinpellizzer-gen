    "intro": "Carex nigra f. subsetacea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved black sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous brownish flowers arranged in dense spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Carex nigra."
