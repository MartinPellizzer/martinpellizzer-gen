    "intro": "Callicarpa zollingeriana, commonly known as the Chinese beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of vibrant purple to pink berries that appear in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by the showy fruits. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly serrated edge and turn red in the fall. The berries are not only ornamental but also attract birds and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
