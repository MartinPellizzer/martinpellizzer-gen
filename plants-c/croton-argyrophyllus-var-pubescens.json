    "intro": "Croton argyrophyllus var. pubescens, commonly known as the silver-leaf croton, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking silver-white leaves with a soft, fuzzy texture due to the presence of fine pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, spiny capsules containing seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique foliage. The leaves are also used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
