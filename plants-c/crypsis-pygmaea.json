    "intro": "Crypsis pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf cryptogram, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, adapted for pollination by wind or specialized insects. Its growth habit is low to the ground, allowing it to thrive in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, Crypsis pygmaea is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
