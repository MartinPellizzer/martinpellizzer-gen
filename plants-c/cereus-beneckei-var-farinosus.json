    "intro": "Cereus beneckei var. farinosus, commonly known as the Farino's Cereus, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that open at night, a feature typical of many night-blooming cacti. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The varietal name 'farinosus' refers to the fine, powdery coating on its stems, which gives it a unique appearance."
