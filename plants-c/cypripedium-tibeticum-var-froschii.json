    "intro": "Cypripedium tibeticum var. froschii, commonly known as the Tibetan lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, typically pink or purple in color. The plant has thick, fleshy roots adapted to the cold and arid conditions of its habitat. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
