It features upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating frost and poor soil conditions. Chrysanthemum popovii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
