It is a climbing vine that produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, purple, and pink. The plant belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and tendrils that aid in climbing. Its flowers open in the morning and close in the evening, hence its common name. Calliopsis tinctoria is also valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine."
