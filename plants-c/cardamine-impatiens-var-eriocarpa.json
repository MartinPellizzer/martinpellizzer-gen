    "intro": "Cardamine impatiens var. eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant features finely divided, floating leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and bloom in early spring. The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
