    "intro": "Cymbidium kerrii, commonly known as the African orchid, is a tropical orchid native to regions of Africa and the Middle East. It features tall, erect pseudobulbs that support strap-like, dark green leaves. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, often with a distinctive yellow lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cymbidium kerrii is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
