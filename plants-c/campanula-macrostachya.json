    "intro": "Campanula macrostachya, commonly known as the large-stemmed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, bearing clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The leaves are typically lanceolate and arranged alternately along the stem, while the flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn. This species thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
