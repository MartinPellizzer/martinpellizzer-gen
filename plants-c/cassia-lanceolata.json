    "intro": "Cassia lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf cassia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets, and it produces bright yellow flowers in clusters. Cassia lanceolata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. Its seeds are encased in long, slender pods that split open when mature, releasing the seeds to the wind."
