    "intro": "Coleocephalocereus fluminensis subsp. braamhaarii, commonly known as the Braamhaai cactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom during the winter months. The plant has a spiny, rugged appearance and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found growing in rocky soils and is known for its slow growth rate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
