    "intro": "Carex homalocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. Carex homalocarpa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
