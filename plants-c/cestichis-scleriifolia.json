    "intro": "Cestichis scleriifolia, commonly known as the hard-leaved cestichis, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are adapted to arid environments, providing moisture retention and protection against intense sunlight. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, adding a delicate visual contrast to its robust foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
