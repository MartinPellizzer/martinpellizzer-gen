    "intro": "Colchicum hiemale, commonly known as the winter aconite, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that appear after the flowers. Its bulbs are toxic and contain colchicine, a compound used in medicine. Colchicum hiemale thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
