It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant typically produces small, elongated racemes of blooms, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white, fuzzy hairs. Cryptantha racemosa is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open grasslands and along streambanks."
