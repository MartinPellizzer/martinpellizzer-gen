It features compact, rounded rosettes of fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
