    "intro": "Cleistocactus wendlandiorum, commonly known as the Wendland\u2019s cactus, is a species native to Brazil. It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed structure and a dense covering of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, a characteristic known as nyctinasty. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
