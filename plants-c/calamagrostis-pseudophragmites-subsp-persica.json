    "intro": "Calamagrostis pseudophragmites subsp. persica, commonly known as the Persian reed, is a grass species native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant typically thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, riverbanks, and wetlands. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-like flowers that are often tinged with purple or brown. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
