    "intro": "Cyathea chiricana var. contigua, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Its fronds are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to forest biodiversity. The varietal form contigua is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Cyathea chiricana."
