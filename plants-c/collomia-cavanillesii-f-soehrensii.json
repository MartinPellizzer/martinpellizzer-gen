    "intro": "Collomia cavanillesii f. soehrensii, commonly known as the Soehrens' phlox, is a rare and unique plant species native to the western United States. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer. This subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Collomia cavanillesii."
