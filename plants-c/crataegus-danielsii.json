    "intro": "Crataegus danielsii, commonly known as Daniels' hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically harvested in the fall, which are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. This species is valued for its hardiness and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
