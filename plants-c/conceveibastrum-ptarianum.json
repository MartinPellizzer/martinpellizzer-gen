    "intro": "Conceveibastrum ptarianum, commonly known as the lace fern, is a delicate and ornamental plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a lacy appearance, making it a popular choice for shaded gardens and indoor spaces. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the propagation of the plant, while its spore-bearing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Overall, Conceveibastrum ptarianum is valued for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
