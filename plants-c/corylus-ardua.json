    "intro": "Corylus ardua, commonly known as the mountain hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or forested habitats, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces catkin-like male flowers and female flowers that develop into edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated margins, turning yellow in autumn. Corylus ardua is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting wildlife."
