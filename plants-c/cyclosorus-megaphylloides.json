    "intro": "Cyclosorus megaphylloides, commonly known as the giant cyclosorus, is a rare and fascinating aquatic plant characterized by its large, broad leaves. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant's leaves are usually divided into four lobes, which are often floating or partially submerged. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, relying on water currents for seed dispersal. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality and ecological health."
