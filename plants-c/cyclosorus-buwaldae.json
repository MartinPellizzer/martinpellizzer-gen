    "intro": "Cyclosorus buwaldae, commonly known as the Bornean water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that float on the water's surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as streams and ponds. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the water. Cyclosorus buwaldae plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling."
