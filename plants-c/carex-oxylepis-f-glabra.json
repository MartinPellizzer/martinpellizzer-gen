    "intro": "Carex oxylepis f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-fruited sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically smooth and glabrous. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are usually borne on short, erect inflorescences. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is distinguished by its lack of pubescence on the perigynia, which are the specialized bracts surrounding the female flowers."
