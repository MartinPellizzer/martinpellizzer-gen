    "intro": "Centaurea scabiosa subsp. sadleriana, commonly known as the Sadler's knapweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, spindly stems that bear narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces striking, bright red to orange flower heads composed of numerous small, tubular florets arranged in a dense, spherical shape. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
