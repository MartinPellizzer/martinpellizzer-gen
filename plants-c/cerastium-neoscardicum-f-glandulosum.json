    "intro": "Cerastium neoscardicum f. glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to parts of Europe. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its hairy foliage and compact growth habit make it a notable species within the Caryophyllaceae family."
