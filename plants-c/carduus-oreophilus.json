    "intro": "Carduus oreophilus, commonly known as the alpine thistle, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of many small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are usually spiny and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The showy purple or pink flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
