    "intro": "Caryopteris incana f. albiflora, commonly known as the silverleaf bluemouth, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, silvery-gray leaves that provide striking visual contrast against its blue-violet flowers. The plant produces small, tubular blossoms that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value lies in its foliage and floral display, which offer seasonal interest throughout the growing season."
