    "intro": "Chilocardamum castellanosii, commonly known as the Castellanos' cardamum, is a rare and endangered species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic, glandular leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by elongated, three-lobed pods containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
