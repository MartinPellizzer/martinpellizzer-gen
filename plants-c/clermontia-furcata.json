    "intro": "Clermontia furcata, commonly known as the Koolau mountain ginger, is a rare flowering plant native to Hawaii. It is a member of the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, branched inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats on forested slopes. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a fragrant aroma. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Clermontia furcata is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
