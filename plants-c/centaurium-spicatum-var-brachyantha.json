It is a member of the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in grasslands, rocky soils, and open woodlands, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while the flowers are clustered in dense spikes. This variety is distinguished by its shorter floral branches compared to other centaury species."
