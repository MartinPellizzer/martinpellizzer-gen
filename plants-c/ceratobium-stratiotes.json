    "intro": "Ceratobium stratiotes, commonly known as the common mouse-ear, is a small, mat-forming perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Ceratobium stratiotes is often found in dry, open habitats such as roadsides and gravelly areas."
