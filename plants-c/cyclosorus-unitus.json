    "intro": "Cyclosorus unitus, commonly known as the spiral liverwort, is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic liverwort belonging to the family Marchaliaceae. It is characterized by its spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow, still water or on damp soil, often in shaded environments. Its structure consists of a thallus with a central axis and whorls of leaves that radiate outward. Cyclosorus unitus is an important component of freshwater ecosystems, contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
