    "intro": "Campanula monocephala, commonly known as the single-headed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters and produces small, oval leaves that are often hairy. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and borders. Campanula monocephala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively low maintenance once established."
