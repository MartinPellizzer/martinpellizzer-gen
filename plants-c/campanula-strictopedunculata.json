The leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its elegant appearance. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
