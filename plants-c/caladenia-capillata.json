    "intro": "Caladenia capillata, commonly known as the slender spider orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family native to southeastern Australia. It features a slender, erect stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf and a single, spider-like flower with a distinctive, elongated labellum. The plant typically blooms in late winter to early spring, producing a vibrant pink or purple flower with intricate patterns. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodlands or heathlands. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
