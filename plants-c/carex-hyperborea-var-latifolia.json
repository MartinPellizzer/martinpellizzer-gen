    "intro": "Carex hyperborea var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved alpine sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves, which are typically broad and flat, and its flowering spikes that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Its adaptability to cold climates makes it a resilient species in harsh environmental conditions."
