    "intro": "Cyclophyllum costatum, commonly known as the ribbed cyclophyllum, is a unique plant belonging to the family Cycadaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, ribbed, and spirally arranged leaves that give it a striking appearance. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, which are typical of gymnosperms. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native regions."
