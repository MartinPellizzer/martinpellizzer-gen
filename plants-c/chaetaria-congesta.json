    "intro": "Chaetaria congesta, commonly known as the clustered hairgrass, is a species of grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, spikelet-like flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture. Chaetaria congesta is typically found in grasslands and open habitats, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
