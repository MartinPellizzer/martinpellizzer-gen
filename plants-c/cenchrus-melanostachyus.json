    "intro": "Cenchrus melanostachyus, commonly known as black-stemmed grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dark green, upright stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny environments. Its fibrous roots make it a useful plant for erosion control and livestock forage."
