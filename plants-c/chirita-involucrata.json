    "intro": "Chirita involucrata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or heartleaf ivy, is a perennial vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically dark green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by spherical, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
