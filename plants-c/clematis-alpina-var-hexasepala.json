    "intro": "Clematis alpina var. hexasepala, commonly known as the alpine clematis, is a perennial vine native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a soft, velvety texture, and its flowers typically feature six sepals, giving it the specific epithet \"hexasepala.\" It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens with suitable support structures."
