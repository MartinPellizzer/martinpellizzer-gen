    "intro": "Carduus chinensis, commonly known as Chinese thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features a robust, spiny stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, often branching at the base. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by spherical, spiny seed heads. Its leaves are deeply lobed, with a rough, hairy texture, and the entire plant is covered in prickly bracts. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
