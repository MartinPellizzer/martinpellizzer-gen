    "intro": "Clutia alaternoides f. revoluta, commonly known as the revolute clutia, is a variant of the clutia plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a shrub characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often revolute, meaning they curl under at the edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The botanical features of this plant make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
