    "intro": "Crossostylis seemannii, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Crossostylis seemannii is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and night-blooming habit."
