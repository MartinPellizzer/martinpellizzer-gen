    "intro": "Calanthe veratrifolia var. kennyi, commonly known as the Kenny's lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It features a dense, dark green foliage with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a long, spiraled inflorescence of white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and requires well-drained, humus-rich soil. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which consists of three sepals and three petals, with the latter often being showy and spurred. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
