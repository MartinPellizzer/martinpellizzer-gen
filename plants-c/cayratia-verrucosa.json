    "intro": "Cayratia verrucosa, commonly known as the hairy cayratia, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its hairy, often pubescent stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically alternate. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Cayratia verrucosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to climb trellises or structures."
