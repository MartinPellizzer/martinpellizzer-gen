    "intro": "Convolvulus arborescens, commonly known as tree morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
