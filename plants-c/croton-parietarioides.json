    "intro": "Croton parietarioides, commonly known as the rock croton, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its branched stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots and a waxy leaf coating to reduce water loss. Croton parietarioides is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
