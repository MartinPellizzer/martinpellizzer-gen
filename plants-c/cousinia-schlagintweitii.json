    "intro": "Cousinia schlagintweitii, commonly known as the Kashmir spurge, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Cousinia schlagintweitii is adapted to cold, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine meadows."
