    "intro": "Cyperus vegetus var. triangularis, commonly known as the triangular flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a triangular cross-section, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically found at the base of the plant. It thrives in wet or marshy environments and is often found in disturbed soils near water bodies. Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly."
