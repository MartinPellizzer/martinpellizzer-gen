    "intro": "Calamagrostis tolucensis var. laxiflora, commonly known as the narrow-flowered bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces clusters of blue to purplish flowers in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
