    "intro": "Castilleja douglasii var. contentiosa, commonly known as Douglas's paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and features showy, red-orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on root connections to neighboring plants for nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
