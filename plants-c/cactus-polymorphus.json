It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its variable growth form, it is often found in a range of habitats, from rocky soils to open grasslands."
