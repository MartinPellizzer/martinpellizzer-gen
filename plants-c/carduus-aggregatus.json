    "intro": "Carduus aggregatus, commonly known as the clustered thistle, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, gray-green leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and woodland edges. Its latex-like sap is milky and can cause skin irritation. The clustered thistle is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
