It is an annual herb characterized by its erect, branched stems and alternate, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It is native to North America and is commonly found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. Due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various conditions, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
