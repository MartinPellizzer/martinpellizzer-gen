It features striking blue to purple flowers that resemble small bells, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
