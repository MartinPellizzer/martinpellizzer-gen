    "intro": "Cotula radiata, commonly known as the silver cotula, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces yellow flowers with white centers, which bloom in clusters during the summer months. Cotula radiata is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance and drought tolerance."
