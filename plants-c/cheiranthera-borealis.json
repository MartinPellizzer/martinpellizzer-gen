It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and related shrubs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
