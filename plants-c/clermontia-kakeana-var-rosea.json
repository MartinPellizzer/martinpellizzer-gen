It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking pink to rose-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats, often on rocky or streamside substrates. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a glossy green surface and serrated margins. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
