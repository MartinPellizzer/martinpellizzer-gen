    "intro": "Capitularia involucrata, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, glandular, and often hairy structures that aid in trapping prey. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and marshes. Its flowers are usually small and clustered in a dense inflorescence called a capitulum. The species is known for its ability to absorb nutrients through both photosynthesis and the digestion of captured insects."
