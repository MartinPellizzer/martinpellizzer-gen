It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, pea-like flowers in early spring. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three small, oval-shaped leaflets. It is adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy plant in arid environments."
