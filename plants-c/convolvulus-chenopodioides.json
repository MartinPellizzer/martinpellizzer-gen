    "intro": "Convolvulus chenopodioides, commonly known as desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with trailing stems that produce small, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to red. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in disturbed or dry environments. It is adapted to survive in low-water conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. The flowers typically bloom in the morning, giving the plant its common name."
