    "intro": "Ceanothus pitcheri, commonly known as the Pitcher's ceanothus, is a shrub native to the western United States, particularly found in California and Oregon. It is characterized by its fragrant, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as chaparral and coastal sage scrub. Its leaves are usually narrow and evergreen, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Ceanothus pitcheri plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife in its native environment."
