    "intro": "Cucurbita pepo convar. giromontia, commonly known as the ornamental gourds, is a variant of the common gourd species. It is characterized by its diverse range of shapes, sizes, and vibrant colors, which make it popular for decorative purposes. The plants are typically herbaceous, with trailing or climbing growth habits, and they produce spherical or elongated fruits. The leaves are usually heart-shaped with a rough texture, and the flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female blooms. These gourds are cultivated for their aesthetic value rather than for food, though some varieties can be edible when mature."
