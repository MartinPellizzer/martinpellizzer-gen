It features striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink with contrasting yellow or orange markings. The plant has a pseudobulb structure typical of many orchids, which stores water and nutrients. Its leaves are strap-like and arranged in a fan shape, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
