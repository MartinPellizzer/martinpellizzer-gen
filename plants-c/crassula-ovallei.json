    "intro": "Crassula ovallei, commonly known as the African snowplant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically oval or egg-shaped, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor plant collections."
