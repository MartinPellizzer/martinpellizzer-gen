It is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, mountainous habitats and is often found in alpine meadows. Its foliage consists of basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
