    "intro": "Celastrus articulatus var. cuneatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf staffvetch, is a perennial climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, twining stems that can reach lengths of up to 15 feet, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often glandular-dotted. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by woody, bead-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in the understory of hardwood forests. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies and traditional herbal use."
