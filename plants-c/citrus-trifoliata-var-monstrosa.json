    "intro": "Citrus trifoliata var. monstrosa, commonly known as the twisted trifoliate orange, is a unique variant of the trifoliate orange. It is characterized by its twisted, contorted branches and leaves, which give it an unusual and ornamental appearance. This plant is native to China and is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than its fruit. It has small, fragrant flowers and produces edible, though somewhat bitter, fruit. The plant is relatively hardy and can thrive in a variety of soil conditions, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
