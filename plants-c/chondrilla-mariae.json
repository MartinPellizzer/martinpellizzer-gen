    "intro": "Chondrilla mariae, commonly known as the Marie's globular cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a small, globular cactus with a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual element to its desert habitat. Its succulent structure and spiny exterior provide protection against herbivores and extreme weather conditions. Chondrilla mariae is well adapted to low rainfall and high temperatures, making it a resilient example of desert flora."
