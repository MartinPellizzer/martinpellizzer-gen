    "intro": "Cassia humifusa, commonly known as the prostrate cassia, is a low-growing shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, spreading stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that are clustered in spikes, typical of the Fabaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Cassia humifusa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
