    "intro": "Commelina diffusa subsp. scandens, commonly known as the creeping spiderwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across moist soils. The plant produces small, blue-violet flowers with three petals and three sepals, typical of the Commelina genus. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in disturbed areas where it can outcompete other vegetation."
