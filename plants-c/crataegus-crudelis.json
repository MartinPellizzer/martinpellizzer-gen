It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and small, apple-like fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature. The plant produces white to pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered in umbels. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges, and turn yellow in the fall. Crataegus crudelis is often found in moist, woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
