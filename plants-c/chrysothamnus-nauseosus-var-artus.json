    "intro": "Chrysothamnus nauseosus var. artus, commonly known as the yellow rabbitbrush, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, cylindrical seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in its range."
