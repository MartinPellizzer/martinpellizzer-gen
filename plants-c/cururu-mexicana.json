    "intro": "Cururu mexicana, commonly known as Mexican nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and the fruit is a small, fleshy berry that ripens to a deep red color. Cururu mexicana is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in warm, arid climates."
