    "intro": "Carex orthostachys var. spuria, commonly known as the spiked sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and pond edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
