    "intro": "Craterocapsa montana, commonly known as the mountain rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and alpine environments, where it forms low, mat-like growths. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and often arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it conserve water in harsh conditions. The flowers are usually white or pale yellow, appearing in early spring and attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
