    "intro": "Canistropsis microps f. bicensis, commonly known as the dwarf canistropsis, is a rare and compact bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. The plant produces striking, tubular inflorescences that are often brightly colored, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its foliage is adapted to thrive in shaded, humid environments, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging species to grow outside its native environment."
