    "intro": "Centaurium calycosum var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf lesser centaury, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pinkish-red in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value."
