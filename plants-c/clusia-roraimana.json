    "intro": "Clusia roraimana, commonly known as the Roraima glorybower, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the tepuis of southern Venezuela and northern Brazil. It belongs to the Clusiaceae family, which includes plants known for their showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant features thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, high-altitude habitat. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a distinctive, spurred shape that attracts pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Clusia roraimana is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in shaded gardens due to its preference for indirect light."
