    "intro": "Cyperus microcephalus subsp. chersophilus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its small, three-lobed flowers are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, and it produces three-winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a ground cover in wetland restoration projects."
