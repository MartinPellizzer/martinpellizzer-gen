    "intro": "Centaurea schimperi, commonly known as the Ethiopian star-thistle, is a flowering plant native to Ethiopia. It is characterized by its striking purple to pink flower heads, which are surrounded by bracts that resemble rays. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Centaurea schimperi is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
