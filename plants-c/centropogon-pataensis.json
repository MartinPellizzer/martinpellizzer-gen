    "intro": "Centropogon pataensis, commonly known as the Pataon grass, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish-white flowers. It is often found in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
