    "intro": "Cladocolea mcvaughii, commonly known as the McVaugh's cliffbrake, is a rare and specialized fern found in specific rocky habitats. It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered fronds that are adapted to grow in crevices and on cliff faces. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing spores in specialized structures called sporangia. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a distinct, often zigzagging pattern. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, Cladocolea mcvaughii is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed, high-altitude ecosystems."
