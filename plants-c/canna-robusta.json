    "intro": "Canna robusta, commonly known as the giant cannas, is a striking ornamental plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, and its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for water gardens and tropical landscapes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vigorously, often forming dense clumps. Canna robusta is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
