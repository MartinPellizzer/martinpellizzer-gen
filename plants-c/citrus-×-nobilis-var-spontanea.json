It is characterized by its small, orange-colored fruits that are typically smaller and more acidic than cultivated mandarins. The plant has a compact growth habit with glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers. It thrives in subtropical climates and is often found in the wild along coastal areas. This variety is valued for its genetic diversity and potential use in breeding programs for improved citrus cultivars."
