    "intro": "Casuarina baxteriana, commonly known as the Baxter's she-oak, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of south-eastern Australia. It has needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dunes and coastal forests. Casuarina baxteriana is valued for its hardy nature and ability to stabilize coastal environments."
