    "intro": "Cerastium earlei, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, rounded leaves and clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cooler climates."
