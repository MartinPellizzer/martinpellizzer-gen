    "intro": "Cyperus imbricatus var. elongatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features grass-like leaves that are narrow and linear, with a fibrous root system adapted to waterlogged soils. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a cylindrical cluster, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
