It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in spring. It has hairy, linear leaves and is adapted to arid environments. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution."
