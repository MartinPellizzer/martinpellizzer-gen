    "intro": "Cistus creticus f. albus, commonly known as the white rock rose, is a rare and striking variant of the rock rose genus. It is characterized by its pale white or pale pink flowers, which contrast with its gray-green foliage. Native to the Mediterranean region, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with small, leathery leaves. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is considered a valuable addition to specialized botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
