    "intro": "Cinchona formosa var. laevis, commonly known as the smooth cinchona, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for the alkaloids it contains, which have been used in the treatment of malaria. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
