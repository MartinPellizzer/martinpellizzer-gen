It features upright stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Campanula syriaca is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
