    "intro": "Cruciata neotaurica, commonly known as the Taurian crucifix, is a rare flowering plant native to the Taurus Mountains in Turkey. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive cruciform (cross-shaped) flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, silky hair. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
