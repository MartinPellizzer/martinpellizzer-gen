    "intro": "Chondrilla pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf goatweed, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters and has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Chondrilla pusilla is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a minor weed in some agricultural settings."
