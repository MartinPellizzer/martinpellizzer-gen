    "intro": "Caesalpinia ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf burr legume, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive pod-like fruits. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in woody, spiny pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind or animals. Caesalpinia ligulata is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock."
