    "intro": "Coursetia, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink, red, and white. The plants are typically shrubs or subshrubs with woody stems and small, often hairy leaves adapted to conserve water. Coursetia species are drought-tolerant and thrive in sandy or rocky soils, making them well-suited for xeriscaping. Their ecological importance includes providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in desert environments."
