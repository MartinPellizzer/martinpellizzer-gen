It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves that are often broader than those of the typical species, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, contributing to its ecological importance in its native habitat."
