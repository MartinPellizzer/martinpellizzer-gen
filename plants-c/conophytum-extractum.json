    "intro": "Conophytum extractum, commonly known as the \"Lion's Tail,\" is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often spiny leaves that resemble a lion's tail. The plant stores water in its thick, fleshy leaves, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. Conophytum extractum is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for rock gardens."
