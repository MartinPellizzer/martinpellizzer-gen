    "intro": "Cistus eriocephalus, commonly known as the woolly rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to arid environments. Its leaves are covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. The plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to support local wildlife."
