    "intro": "Centaurea codringtonii, commonly known as the Codrington's cornflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers with distinctive ray florets and a central disk, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Centaurea codringtonii is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils."
