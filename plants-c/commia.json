It is native to tropical regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Asia. The plant is characterized by its aromatic resinous sap, which is harvested for medicinal and aromatic purposes. Commia species often have small, leathery leaves and produce yellow or white flowers. The resin, known as myrrh, has been used for centuries in traditional medicine, incense, and as a preservative."
