    "intro": "Castanea mollissima var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping chestnut, is a variant of the Chinese chestnut characterized by its distinctive drooping branches. This variety features elongated, pendulous shoots that give it a unique, cascading appearance. The leaves are typically large, ovate, and pubescent, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and appear in clusters, followed by the production of edible, spiny nuts. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been cultivated for both its aesthetic appeal and its potential for nut production."
