    "intro": "Cochlearia officinalis var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf scurvy grass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its rosette growth habit and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a single umbel. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. It is valued for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of vitamin C."
