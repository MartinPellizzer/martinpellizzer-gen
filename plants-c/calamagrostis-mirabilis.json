    "intro": "Calamagrostis mirabilis, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking purple or violet-colored inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its tall, slender stalks can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Calamagrostis mirabilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in wet conditions."
