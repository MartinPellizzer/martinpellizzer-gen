    "intro": "Coelogyne pollucifera, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features showy, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a striking contrast of white and green in the petals. The plant has a pseudobulb structure typical of many orchids, which stores water and nutrients. Its leaves are strap-like and arranged in a fan shape, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
