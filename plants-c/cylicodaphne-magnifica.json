    "intro": "Cylicodaphne magnifica, commonly known as the golden dracaena, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia. It features tall, slender stems with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are a vibrant green with a subtle golden hue. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cylicodaphne magnifica is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and air-purifying properties."
