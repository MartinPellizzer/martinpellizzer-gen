    "intro": "Crassula alpestris, commonly known as the rock jade or alpine crassula, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, storing water in its leaves to survive drought conditions. Crassula alpestris is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance."
