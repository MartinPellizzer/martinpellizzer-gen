    "intro": "Calawaya schlechteri, commonly known as the Philippine orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate floral structure and vibrant colors. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a unique morphology that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Calawaya schlechteri is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
