    "intro": "Caladium cannaertii, commonly known as the red-veined caladium, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with deep red veins against a creamy-white background. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and prefers partial to full shade. Its foliage is the main ornamental feature, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Caladium cannaertii is often grown as an annual in cooler climates due to its sensitivity to frost."
