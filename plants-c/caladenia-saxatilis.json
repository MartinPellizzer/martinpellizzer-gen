    "intro": "Caladenia saxatilis, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Western Australia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces a single, slender stem that bears a single, resupinate (upside-down) flower with a distinctive, often pink or purple hue. Its floral structure is characteristic of the orchid family, featuring three sepals and three petals, with the labellum being highly specialized. Caladenia saxatilis is an example of the diverse and often striking floral morphology found within the orchid genus."
