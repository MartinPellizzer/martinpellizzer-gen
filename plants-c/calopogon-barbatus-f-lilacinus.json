    "intro": "Calopogon barbatus f. lilacinus, commonly known as the lilac-flowered bog onion, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking violet to lilac-colored flowers, which bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and pine forests, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in height. This unique orchid is often considered an indicator species for healthy wetland ecosystems."
