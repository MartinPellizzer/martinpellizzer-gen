It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often bright green and have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring. These flowers are followed by elongated, narrow pods that contain the seeds. Cassia montana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
