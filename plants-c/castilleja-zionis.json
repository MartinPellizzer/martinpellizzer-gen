It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red to orange tubular flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host for nutrients, often growing on the roots of grasses or shrubs. It is adapted to arid environments and is commonly found in rocky soils at higher elevations. Castilleja zionis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by supporting pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
