    "intro": "Cuscuta corymbosa var. corymbosa, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with numerous slender, thread-like stems. The plant is native to North America and is often found parasitizing a variety of herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to spread across different habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and natural vegetation."
