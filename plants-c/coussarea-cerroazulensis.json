    "intro": "Coussarea cerroazulensis, commonly known as the Blue Mountain Coussarea, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that ranges from deep green to bluish-gray in color. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in well-drained, acidic soils. Coussarea cerroazulensis is often cultivated in shaded garden settings due to its preference for cool, moist environments."
