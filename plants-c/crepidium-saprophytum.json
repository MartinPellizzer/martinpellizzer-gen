    "intro": "Crepidium saprophytum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial orchid that grows in wet, sandy soils, often in pine flatwoods or swampy areas. The plant produces striking, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It has a unique symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which provide essential nutrients for its growth. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is listed as endangered in several states."
