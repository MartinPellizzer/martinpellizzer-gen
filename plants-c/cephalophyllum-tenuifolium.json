    "intro": "Cephalophyllum tenuifolium, commonly known as the slender-leaved headplant, is a rare and unique member of the Cactaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and small, spiny stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Native to the arid regions of northern Mexico, it thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
