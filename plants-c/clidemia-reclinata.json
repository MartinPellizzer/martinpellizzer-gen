    "intro": "Clidemia reclinata, commonly known as the creeping marshplant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the wetlands of Central and South America. It features prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across moist soils. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the wet season. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and covered in fine, soft hairs. Clidemia reclinata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks."
