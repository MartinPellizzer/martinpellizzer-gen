    "intro": "Cyclosorus ferox, commonly known as the ferocious cyclosorus, is a rare and delicate aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, linear leaves that form a dense, floating mat on the water surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in shaded, nutrient-rich wetlands. Its spores are released in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Cyclosorus ferox is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitats."
