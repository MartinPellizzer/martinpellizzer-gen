    "intro": "Chaetanthera aymarae, commonly known as the Aymara moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
