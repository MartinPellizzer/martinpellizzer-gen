    "intro": "Cupania juglandifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian walnut or Brazilian pecan, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces edible nuts enclosed in a hard shell, similar to those of the pecan tree. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is cultivated in some regions for both aesthetic and agricultural purposes."
