It features showy, pink to red tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a distinctive tuberous root system, which is its namesake and a key feature for propagation. Its foliage consists of heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats."
