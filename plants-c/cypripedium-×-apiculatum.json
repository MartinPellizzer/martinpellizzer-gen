    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 apiculatum, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium \u00d7 mackayi. It is a perennial herb with a distinctive pouch-shaped lip that serves as a nectar trap to attract pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments and has tall, upright stems with broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a prominent central spur that aids in pollination. This orchid is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
