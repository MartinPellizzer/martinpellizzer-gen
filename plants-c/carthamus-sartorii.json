It is characterized by its spiny, branched stems and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
