    "intro": "Calamus merrillii, commonly known as the Merrill's screw-pine, is a rare and endangered species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pandanaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that are often used in traditional medicine and crafts. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as swampy forests and riverbanks. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Calamus merrillii faces significant threats to its survival."
