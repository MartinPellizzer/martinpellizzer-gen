    "intro": "Candollea lobuliflora, commonly known as the leafy liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features small, overlapping leaves that are often covered in a thin layer of water, which helps in photosynthesis and reproduction. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its structure includes specialized structures called gametophytes. Candollea lobuliflora plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil moisture and providing habitat for microorganisms."
