    "intro": "Cestrum grandiflorum, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, featuring thick, woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant is most notable for its large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, emitting a strong, sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its flowers are typically 5-7 cm in diameter and bloom in clusters at the ends of the branches. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible but often have a spicy taste."
