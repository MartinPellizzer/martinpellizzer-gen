    "intro": "Crocus vernus var. leucorhynchus, commonly known as the white crocus, is a variety of the common crocus characterized by its pale to white flowers. It is a bulbous plant native to southern Europe, particularly found in regions like Spain and Portugal. The flowers typically bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge, and are borne on short, sturdy stems. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves that grow from the base of the bulb. It is valued in horticulture for its elegant appearance and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
