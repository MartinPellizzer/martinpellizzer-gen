    "intro": "Croton sidifolius var. domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican croton, is a shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly Dominica. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from green to red and yellow. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
