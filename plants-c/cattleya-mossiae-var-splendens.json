    "intro": "Cattleya mossiae var. splendens, commonly known as the Splendens Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid prized for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms. It features large, showy flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, often with intricate patterns and a distinctive golden lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks rather than in soil. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
