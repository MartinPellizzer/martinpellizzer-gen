    "intro": "Cerasus lusitanica var. ormistoniensis, commonly known as the Ormistoniensis cherry, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Prunus genus and is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not widely cultivated for commercial use. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
