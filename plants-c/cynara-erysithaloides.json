    "intro": "Cynara erysithaloides, commonly known as the red thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features spiny, reddish stems and leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces purple to pink flower heads that resemble thistles, which are surrounded by bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its prickly nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but is also valued for its ornamental appeal."
