    "intro": "Cynomyrtus tomentosa, commonly known as the velvet myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
