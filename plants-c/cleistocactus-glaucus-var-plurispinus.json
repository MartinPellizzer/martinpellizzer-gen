    "intro": "Cleistocactus glaucus var. plurispinus, commonly known as the spiny blue cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, spiny tubercles, giving it a rugged appearance. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in the evening, a trait typical of many nocturnal flowering cacti. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The variety plurispinus distinguishes itself through its more pronounced spines compared to the typical form of Cleistocactus glaucus."
