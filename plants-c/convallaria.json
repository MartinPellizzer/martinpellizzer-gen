    "intro": "Convallaria, commonly known as lily of the valley, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Convallariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink in color. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the toxic seeds, which are used in the production of digitalis, a medication used to treat heart conditions. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, evergreen leaves that form a dense carpet, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
