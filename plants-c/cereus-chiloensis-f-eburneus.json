    "intro": "Cereus chiloensis f. eburneus, commonly known as the white-flowered chilote cactus, is a rare and striking variant of the Chilote cactus. It is native to the coastal regions of Chile and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and large, white flowers that bloom at night. The plant features spiny areoles and produces small, edible fruits that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for desert gardens. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is often cultivated by cactus enthusiasts and botanists."
