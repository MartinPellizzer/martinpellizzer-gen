    "intro": "Cavendishia guatapeensis, commonly known as the Guatap\u00e9 Cavendish, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of Colombia. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescences that bloom in vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its high-altitude environment. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
