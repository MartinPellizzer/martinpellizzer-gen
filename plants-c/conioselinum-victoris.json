It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley, dill, and carrots, sharing similar aromatic properties. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
