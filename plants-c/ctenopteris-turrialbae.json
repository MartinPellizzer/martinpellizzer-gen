    "intro": "Ctenopteris turrialbae, commonly known as the Turrialba tree fern, is a species native to Central America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in tropical rainforests. Its rhizome is robust and capable of producing new shoots, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in its ecological interactions."
