    "intro": "Ceropegia sulcata subsp. seminuda, commonly known as the sand dollar plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It features tubular, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, pale green or yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. Its leaves are typically small and rounded, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and unique appearance."
