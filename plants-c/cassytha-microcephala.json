    "intro": "Cassytha microcephala, commonly known as littlehead dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to Australia. It lacks true roots and chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure that allows it to spread across its host. It is often found growing on the stems of other plants, such as grasses and shrubs. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, and it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its environment."
