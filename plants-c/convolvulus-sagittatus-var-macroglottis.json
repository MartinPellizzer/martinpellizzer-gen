    "intro": "Convolvulus sagittatus var. macroglottis, commonly known as the broad-leaved morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is a vigorous climber with hairy stems and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
