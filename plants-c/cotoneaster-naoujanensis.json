It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a glossy surface, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
