    "intro": "Celtis diffusa, commonly known as the Chinese hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, pale green berries that mature to a dark purple. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant. The plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to withstand urban conditions."
