    "intro": "Calligonum acanthopterum f. acanthopterum, commonly known as the spiny leaf calligonum, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with spiny margins, which provide protection against herbivory. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, typically during the summer months. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low precipitation and high temperatures. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers."
