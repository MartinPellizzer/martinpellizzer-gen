    "intro": "Cistus vulgaris var. creticus, commonly known as the Cretan rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in Greece and other parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen leaves and vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to arid and semi-arid environments. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves and flowers, are used in perfumery and traditional medicine. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
