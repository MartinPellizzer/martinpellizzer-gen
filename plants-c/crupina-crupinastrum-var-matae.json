    "intro": "Crupina crupinastrum var. matae, commonly known as the Matae crupina, is a coastal plant native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is a perennial herb with erect, hairy stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure."
