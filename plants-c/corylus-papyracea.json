    "intro": "Corylus papyracea, commonly known as the paper hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the hazelnut family, Fagaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, spiny capsules that contain edible nuts, which are similar in appearance to hazelnuts but often have a more fibrous texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and streamside habitats. The paper hazel is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
