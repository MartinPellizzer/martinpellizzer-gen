    "intro": "Cyathea divergens var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf tree fern, is a variety of the tree fern genus Cyathea native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its relatively small stature compared to other Cyathea species, with a slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in lowland rainforests. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, adding a unique visual element to its appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
