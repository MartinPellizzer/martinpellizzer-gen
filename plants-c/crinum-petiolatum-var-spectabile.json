    "intro": "Crinum petiolatum var. spectabile, commonly known as the showy crinum, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a distinctive yellow or greenish throat. The plant features broad, strap-like leaves that are usually dark green and arranged in a rosette pattern. It produces tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting the showy inflorescence. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
