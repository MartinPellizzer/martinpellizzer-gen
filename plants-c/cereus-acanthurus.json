    "intro": "Cereus acanthurus, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a flowering cactus native to the Canary Islands. It features a swollen, brightly colored upper portion called the \"pseudostem,\" which is actually a grafted part of a different species. The lower part of the plant is a rootstock, typically a green or blue-green cactus, which provides the necessary structure and nutrients. The flowers are typically white or pink and appear at the top of the plant during the warmer months. This plant is popular as a houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
