    "intro": "Cladium angustifolium, commonly known as sawgrass, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in shallow water or swampy areas, forming dense stands. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often used as thatching material. Its flowering spikes are usually borne on tall, slender stems above the water surface. Sawgrass plays an important role in the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
