    "intro": "Crepidium trukense, commonly known as the Truk orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the island of Truk in the Federated States of Micronesia. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit and produces delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant has a pseudobulb structure typical of many orchids, which helps it store water and nutrients in its native tropical climate. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and human activity."
