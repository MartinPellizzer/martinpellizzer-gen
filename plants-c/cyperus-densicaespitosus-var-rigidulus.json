    "intro": "Cyperus densicaespitosus var. rigidulus, commonly known as rigid flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its cylindrical, often three-ranked leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. Its dense, spiky foliage and compact growth habit make it a common weed in disturbed aquatic habitats. The species is notable for its ability to tolerate a wide range of soil conditions and water depths."
