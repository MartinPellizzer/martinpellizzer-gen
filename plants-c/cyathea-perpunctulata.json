    "intro": "Cyathea perpunctulata, commonly known as the punctuated tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Its fronds are typically green with a distinctive pattern of small, dark spots, giving it its common name. Cyathea perpunctulata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along riverbanks."
