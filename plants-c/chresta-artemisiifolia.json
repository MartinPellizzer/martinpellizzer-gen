    "intro": "Chresta artemisiifolia, commonly known as common ragweed, is an annual flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late summer. The plant is known for its allergenic pollen, which is a major contributor to seasonal allergies. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and along fence rows. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings."
