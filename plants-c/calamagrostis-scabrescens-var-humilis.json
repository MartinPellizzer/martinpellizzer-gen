It typically reaches heights of 30 to 60 centimeters and features narrow, gray-green leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers in late summer, which are often tinged with purple or pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators."
