    "intro": "Cuscuta approximata subsp. macranthera, commonly known as the giant dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host, forming a parasitic connection. It is native to North America and can be found in a variety of habitats, including fields and disturbed areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth of its host plants."
