It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open forests or heathlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
