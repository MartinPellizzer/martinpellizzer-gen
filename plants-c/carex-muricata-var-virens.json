It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green, with a slightly rough texture along the leaf margins. The plant produces tall, cylindrical spikes of small, greenish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often found in riparian zones or along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting wetland biodiversity."
