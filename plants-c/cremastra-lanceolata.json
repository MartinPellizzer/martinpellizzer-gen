    "intro": "Cremastra lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has lance-shaped, smooth, and often hairy leaves. Its roots are fibrous and can form colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in woodland environments. Cremastra lanceolata is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
