    "intro": "Caladenia deformis var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered spider orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in rocky soils and open habitats, often in heathlands or along coastal areas. The plant features a slender, often branched stem that bears a single, strikingly white flower with a distinctive spider-like appearance. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by thynnid wasps, which are attracted by the plant's specialized floral structures. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique and elegant blooms."
