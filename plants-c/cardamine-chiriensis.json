    "intro": "Cardamine chiriensis, commonly known as the Chiribiquete watercress, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in the Chiribiquete region of Colombia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are often submerged or floating in water, adapting to its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with four petals arranged in a cross shape, typical of the Brassicaceae family. Cardamine chiriensis is valued for its nutritional content and has been used in traditional medicine by local communities."
