    "intro": "Carex vesicaria var. jejuna, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of ponds. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces minute, wind-dispersed seeds. The varietal form, jejuna, is distinguished by its narrower leaves and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Carex vesicaria."
