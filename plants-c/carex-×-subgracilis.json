    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 subgracilis, commonly known as the slender marsh sedge, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Carex genus in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-green leaves that form dense, clumping growth patterns. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically found in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. Carex \u00d7 subgracilis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
