    "intro": "Crassula maritima, commonly known as the coastal crassula, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and saline environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, typically during the summer months. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun exposure, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Due to its resilience and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
