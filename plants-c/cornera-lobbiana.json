    "intro": "Cornera lobbiana, commonly known as the rock fig, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring. Its fruit, a small, round fig-like structure, is edible and has a sweet, fig-like taste. Cornera lobbiana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils."
