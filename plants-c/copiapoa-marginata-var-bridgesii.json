    "intro": "Copiapoa marginata var. bridgesii, commonly known as the Bridges' copiapoa, is a columnar cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It features a tall, slender stem with a ribbed structure and spines that are typically white or pale in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the cooler months, usually in spring or early summer. It is adapted to extreme aridity, storing water in its thick stem and having a shallow root system. This variety is prized for its striking appearance and is often cultivated in arid gardens."
