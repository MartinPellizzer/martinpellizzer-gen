    "intro": "Clompanus zippelii, commonly known as the Zippel\u2019s flameleaf, is a rare flowering plant native to the temperate forests of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bi-colored leaves that display a deep green on the top and a vibrant red underside. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of orange and yellow, which bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires partial shade to full sun. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
