It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows on the branches of host trees, drawing nutrients and water from them. Its berries, which are red and fleshy, are an important food source for various bird species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
