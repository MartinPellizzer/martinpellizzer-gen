    "intro": "Cassipourea peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian cassipourea, is a small evergreen tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in secondary forests and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
