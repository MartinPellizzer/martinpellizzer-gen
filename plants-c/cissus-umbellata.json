    "intro": "Cissus umbellata, commonly known as the snow vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces distinctive, fleshy, waxy berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough, textured surface, while its stems are succulent and can store water. Cissus umbellata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in humid environments."
