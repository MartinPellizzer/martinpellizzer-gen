    "intro": "Chorisia, commonly known as the desert willow, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bignoniaceae. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Americas, and parts of Asia. Chorisia species typically have thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. They are often used in landscaping due to their ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
