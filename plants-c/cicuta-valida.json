    "intro": "Cicuta valida, commonly known as water hemlock, is a highly toxic plant native to North America. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, but it is one of the most poisonous members of the group. The plant has a distinctive appearance with smooth, hollow stems and large, fern-like leaves. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. Cicuta valida contains cicutoxin, a potent neurotoxin that can be lethal if ingested."
