    "intro": "Ceropteris \u00d7 longipes, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a hybrid fern species that exhibits a combination of traits from its parent species, Ceropteris fulva and Ceropteris multicaulis. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Ceropteris \u00d7 longipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its aesthetic and ecological benefits in botanical gardens."
