    "intro": "Cereus minutiflorus, commonly known as the small-flower cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a flowering cactus characterized by its tall, spiny stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom at night. The plant is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its flowers emit a sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant's unique morphology and nocturnal blooming habit make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
