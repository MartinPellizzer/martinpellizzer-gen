    "intro": "Convolvulus mairei, commonly known as the Maire's morning glory, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a climbing vine with heart-shaped leaves and produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in coastal and forest margins. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it popular in gardens, though it can become invasive if not controlled. Convolvulus mairei is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for native pollinators."
