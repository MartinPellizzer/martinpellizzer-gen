    "intro": "Chilopogon distichum, commonly known as the two-ranked grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with two rows of leaves, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of compact spikelets, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Chilopogon distichum is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
