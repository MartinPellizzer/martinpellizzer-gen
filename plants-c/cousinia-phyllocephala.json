    "intro": "Cousinia phyllocephala, commonly known as the leaf-headed fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are often densely packed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are small and yellow, often appearing in clusters, and bloom during the summer months."
