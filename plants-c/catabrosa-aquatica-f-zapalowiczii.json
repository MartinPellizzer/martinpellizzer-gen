    "intro": "Catabrosa aquatica f. zapalowiczii, commonly known as the Zapalowicz's water catabrosa, is a rare aquatic plant species characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and specialized root systems adapted for water environments. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant's leaves are usually oval-shaped with a waxy surface to reduce water loss, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged. Its floral structure is adapted for pollination by aquatic insects, and it plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
