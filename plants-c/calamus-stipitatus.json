    "intro": "Calamus stipitatus, commonly known as the broad-leafed calamus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers. Calamus stipitatus is often found in wetland or swampy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance lies in its ecological role within tropical wetlands."
