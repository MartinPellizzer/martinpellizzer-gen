The plant has slender, grass-like stems and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually yellow or reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and the plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation in wetland ecosystems."
