    "intro": "Cristaria multifida subsp. moquipana, commonly known as the Moquipan starflower, is a rare and specialized plant native to the high Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant has small, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
