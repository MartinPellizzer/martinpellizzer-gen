    "intro": "Convolvulus multivalvis, commonly known as the broadleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is a climbing vine with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports and structures. It blooms during the warmer months, typically from spring to early summer. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind or animal contact."
