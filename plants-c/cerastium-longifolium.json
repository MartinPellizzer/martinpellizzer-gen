    "intro": "Cerastium longifolium, commonly known as the slender chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Cerastium longifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in garden settings for its delicate foliage and blooms."
