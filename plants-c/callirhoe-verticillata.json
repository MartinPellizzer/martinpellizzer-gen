    "intro": "Callirhoe verticillata, commonly known as the whorled sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem, which is a distinctive botanical trait. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Callirhoe verticillata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
