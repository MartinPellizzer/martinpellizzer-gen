    "intro": "Chabraea thermarum, commonly known as the hot spring chabraea, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a striking color contrast between the petals and sepals. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments, typically near geothermal areas where its name originates. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Chabraea thermarum is considered a rare and specialized species."
