    "intro": "Ceraia alabensis, commonly known as the Alabama ceria, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss, Ceraia alabensis is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
