    "intro": "Carex cruenta, commonly known as blood grass, is a perennial sedge native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically reddish-brown at the base, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Carex cruenta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
