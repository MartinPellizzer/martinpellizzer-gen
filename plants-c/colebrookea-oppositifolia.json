    "intro": "Colebrookea oppositifolia, commonly known as the Kashmiri snow lotus, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is a member of the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its striking white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white hairs, helping to protect it from cold temperatures. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
