    "intro": "Carex vulgaris subsp. reuteriana, commonly known as the common sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in three ranks, and it produces small, clustered spikelets that are wind-pollinated. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife. The subspecies reuteriana is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and flowering structure compared to the typical form of Carex vulgaris."
