    "intro": "Chrysosplenium alternifolium subsp. arctomontanum, commonly known as the alpine chrysosplenium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically features rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white or pale yellow, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in cool, moist, and well-drained soils, often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its foliage is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
