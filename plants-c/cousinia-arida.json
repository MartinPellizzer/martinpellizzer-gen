    "intro": "Cousinia arida, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers arranged in dense, compact inflorescences called cymes. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Cousinia arida is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
