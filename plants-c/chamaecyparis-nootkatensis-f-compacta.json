    "intro": "Chamaecyparis nootkatensis f. compacta, commonly known as the compact form of the Alaska cedar, is a cultivar characterized by its dense, pyramidal growth habit. It is a member of the cypress family (Cupressaceae) and is native to the western coast of North America. The plant features scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath, providing a striking contrast. It produces small, inconspicuous cones and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. This cultivar is well-suited for smaller spaces due to its compact size and resilience to various environmental conditions."
