    "intro": "Carex pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically greenish or brownish in color, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Carex pyrenaica thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
