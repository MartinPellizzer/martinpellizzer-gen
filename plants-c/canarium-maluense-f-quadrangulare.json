    "intro": "Canarium maluense f. quadrangulare, commonly known as the quadrangular canarium, is a variant of the canarium species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinct quadrangular (four-sided) stems, which give it a unique structural appearance. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and elliptic in shape, with a smooth surface and a slightly leathery texture. The fruit is a small, woody drupe, often used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil."
