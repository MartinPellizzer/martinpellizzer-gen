    "intro": "Cypripedium dayi, commonly known as the Yunnan\u6753\u5170, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base, which is a common feature among orchids. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky substrates or in the understory of dense vegetation. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, and the plant produces a single, intricate flower that blooms in late spring or early summer. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cypripedium dayi is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
