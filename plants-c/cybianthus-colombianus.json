It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often branched. Cybianthus colombianus plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar to pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
