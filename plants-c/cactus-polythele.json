    "intro": "Cactus polythele, commonly known as the desert rose, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It features a short, thick stem with distinctive, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant has spiny stems and is adapted to store water in its fleshy tissue. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, helping to minimize water loss. The flowers are often used in traditional medicine and are also popular in ornamental gardening."
