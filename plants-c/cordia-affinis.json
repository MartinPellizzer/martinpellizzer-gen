    "intro": "Cordia affinis, commonly known as the red cedar or red gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to parts of Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid regions. Cordia affinis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally for various purposes by Indigenous communities."
