    "intro": "Carex vulgaris f. abbreviata, commonly known as the short-stemmed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and stiff, with a distinct midrib, and it forms dense clumps through rhizomes. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
