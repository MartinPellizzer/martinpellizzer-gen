    "intro": "Claytonia coquimbensis, commonly known as the Coquimbo sandplant, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of central Chile. It is characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, white or pink flowers during the spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid and coastal climate of its native habitat. Its leaves are typically succulent, helping it retain moisture in dry conditions. Claytonia coquimbensis is often found in rocky or coastal areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and supporting local biodiversity."
