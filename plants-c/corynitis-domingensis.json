It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
