    "intro": "Caladenia pluvialis, commonly known as the rain lily, is a striking orchid species native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils near coastal areas and is often found in heathlands and woodland habitats. The plant features a single, erect stem with a single, showy flower that is usually pink or purple in color. Its floral structure is highly specialized, with a narrow, spurred labellum that attracts specific pollinators. Caladenia pluvialis is a perennial herb that blooms during the cooler months, making it a notable addition to the region's flora."
