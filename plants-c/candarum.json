    "intro": "Candarum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale, almost translucent petals. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it blooms infrequently, making it a subject of fascination for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and its rarity, candarum is considered endangered in many areas."
