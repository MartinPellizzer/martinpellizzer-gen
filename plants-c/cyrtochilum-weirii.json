    "intro": "Cyrtochilum weirii, commonly known as the Weir's slipper orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and intricate, slipper-shaped flowers that are often brightly colored. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Cyrtochilum weirii produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
