    "intro": "Cirsium lappaceum var. tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, fuzzy, purple-blue flowering heads that appear in summer. The leaves are broadly lance-shaped, covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. This variety is closely related to other thistle species within the Cirsium genus, sharing similar ecological and botanical traits."
