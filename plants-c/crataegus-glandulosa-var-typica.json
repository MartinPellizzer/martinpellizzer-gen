    "intro": "Crataegus glandulosa var. typica, commonly known as the smooth hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and features thornless branches, which distinguish it from other hawthorn species. The plant produces white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated margins and a glossy upper surface. This species is often found in moist to wet habitats, such as stream banks and swamps, and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance."
