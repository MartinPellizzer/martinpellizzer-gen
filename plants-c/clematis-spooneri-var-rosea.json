    "intro": "Clematis spooneri var. rosea, commonly known as the rose-flowered clematis, is a climbing vine native to the mountainous regions of China. It features showy, semi-double to fully double flowers that range in color from white to pink and deep rose. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that provide a delicate texture to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden borders or trellises. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, typically from late spring to early summer."
