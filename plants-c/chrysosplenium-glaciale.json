    "intro": "Chrysosplenium glaciale, commonly known as the glacier spleenwort, is a rare and delicate plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Saxifragaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or silver hairs. The plant produces tiny, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
