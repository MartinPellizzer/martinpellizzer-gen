    "intro": "Carpinus fargesiana var. ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, spiky fruits that are dispersed by wind, and its bark is smooth and grayish-brown when young. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
