    "intro": "Cerbera ovata, commonly known as the poison apple or white coral tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale green to white bark and its striking, white to pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are highly toxic due to the presence of cardioactive glycosides. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture. Cerbera ovata is often cultivated for its ornamental value but requires caution due to its toxic properties."
