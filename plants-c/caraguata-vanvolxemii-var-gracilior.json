It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. Its flowers are small, pinkish-white, and bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
