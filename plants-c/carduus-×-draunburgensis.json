    "intro": "Carduus \u00d7 draunburgensis, commonly known as the hybrid thistle, is a composite plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Carduus nutans and Carduus marianus, resulting in a plant with distinctive morphological features. The species typically exhibits spiny leaves and purple to pink flower heads, which are characteristic of many thistle species. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
