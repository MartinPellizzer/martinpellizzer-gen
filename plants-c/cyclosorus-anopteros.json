    "intro": "Cyclosorus anopteros, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water clover, is a small aquatic fern native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its fronds are usually submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Cyclosorus anopteros plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
