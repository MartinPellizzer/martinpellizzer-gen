    "intro": "Catocoma laurifolia, commonly known as the laurel fern, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery leaves that resemble those of laurel plants. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and undergrowth. Its rhizomatous structure allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Catocoma laurifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
