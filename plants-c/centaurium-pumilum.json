    "intro": "Centaurium pumilum, commonly known as dwarf centaury, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, erect stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and open woodlands. Centaurium pumilum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, daisy-like flowers."
