    "intro": "Cotyledon ovata, commonly known as the elephant's ear or broad-leafed cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy, and often colorful leaves that can range from green to red, purple, or yellow. The plant belongs to the family Aizoaceae and is known for its ability to store water in its leaves, making it drought-tolerant. Its leaves are typically broad and ovate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Cotyledon ovata is popular as a houseplant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
