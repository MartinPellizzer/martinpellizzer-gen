    "intro": "Carex macroura, commonly known as the long-beak sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers. Carex macroura typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
