    "intro": "Clidemia cordifolia, commonly known as heartleaf miconia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often clustered in terminal inflorescences. It is often found in moist, shaded areas of rainforests and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
