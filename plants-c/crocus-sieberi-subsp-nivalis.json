    "intro": "Crocus sieberi subsp. nivalis, commonly known as the alpine crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and a short rhizome, adapted to survive in cold, rocky environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas where the climate is harsh and the growing season is short. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar ecological conditions."
