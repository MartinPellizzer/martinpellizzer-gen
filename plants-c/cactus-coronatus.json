    "intro": "Cactus coronatus, commonly known as the golden crown cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems that form a dense, globular shape. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often surrounded by a crown-like arrangement of bracts. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in drought conditions. Cactus coronatus is well adapted to hot, dry environments and requires minimal water once established."
