It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape with horizontal branches that create a distinctive, compact appearance. The plant has scale-like leaves that are blue-green in color, giving it a fresh, ornamental look. It is evergreen, retaining its foliage year-round, and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. This variety is often used in landscaping for its formal structure and drought tolerance."
