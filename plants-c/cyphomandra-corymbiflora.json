    "intro": "Cyphomandra corymbiflora, commonly known as the purple eggplant, is a member of the Solanaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its striking violet to purple fruits. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers are clustered in corymbs, which are flat-topped or rounded inflorescences, and are usually white or pale purple in color. The fruit, which resembles a small egg, is edible when mature and has a mild, slightly sweet flavor."
