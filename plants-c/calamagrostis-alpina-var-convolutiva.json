    "intro": "Calamagrostis alpina var. convolutiva, commonly known as the Alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and compact growth habit, which makes it well adapted to harsh alpine environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its slender, tufted culms and inflorescence of spikelets contribute to its ornamental appeal. This variety is valued in horticulture for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in challenging landscapes."
