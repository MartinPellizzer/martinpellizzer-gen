    "intro": "Chrysolaena verbascifolia, commonly known as the woolly goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green foliage and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers are typically arranged in dense, terminal clusters, making it a striking addition to gardens in suitable climates."
