It is characterized by its composite flower heads, which consist of both ray and disk flowers. The leaves are typically alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a hairy texture. Conuleum species are native to various regions in the Americas and are often found in disturbed soils or open habitats. They play a role in supporting pollinators and are sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
