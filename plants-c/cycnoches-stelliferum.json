    "intro": "Cycnoches stelliferum, commonly known as the star-bearing cycnoches, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that bear numerous small, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by small insects, and it produces elongated, segmented fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts of rare orchids."
