    "intro": "Campylotropis yunnanensis, commonly known as Yunnan's bent-stemmed trefoil, is a flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its seeds are encased in pods, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
