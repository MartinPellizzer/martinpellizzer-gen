    "intro": "Caladenia orientalis, commonly known as the Eastern Spider Orchid, is a striking orchid species native to southeastern Australia. It features a slender, erect stem with a single, showy flower that typically has a dark, spider-like appearance. The plant produces a single, lance-shaped leaf and blooms from late winter to early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats such as heathlands and woodlands. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from land clearing, it is classified as vulnerable in some regions."
