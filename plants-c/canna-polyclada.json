    "intro": "Canna polyclada, commonly known as the arrowroot plant, is a tropical perennial herb native to the Americas. It features large, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, and its rhizomes are the primary part used for its starchy roots. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible rhizomes. Canna polyclada is also notable for its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative propagation. It is sometimes considered invasive in certain regions due to its aggressive growth habits."
