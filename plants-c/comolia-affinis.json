    "intro": "Comolia affinis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf comolia, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and forest edges. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers appear in clusters during late spring to early summer. Comolia affinis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
