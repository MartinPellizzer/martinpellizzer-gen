    "intro": "Cardamine resedifolia var. integrifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved watercress, is a herbaceous plant native to moist, shady environments in temperate regions. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a smooth margin, and its stems are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically in early spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in wet soils, making it a common sight in stream banks and marshy areas. The species is valued for its peppery flavor and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
