    "intro": "Callitriche ovata, commonly known as broadleaf water-starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wetlands. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are tiny and greenish-white, often appearing in clusters near the water's surface. Callitriche ovata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through oxygenation."
