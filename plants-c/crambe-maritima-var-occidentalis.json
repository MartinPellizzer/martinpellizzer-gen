It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates salt spray and wind. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in arid coastal environments. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
