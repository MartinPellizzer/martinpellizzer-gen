    "intro": "Cymbidium linearisepalum var. atrovirens, commonly known as the dark green sword orchid, is a striking orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that resemble a sword, and its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a distinctive red or purple lip. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, fragrant blooms that appear during the winter months. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
