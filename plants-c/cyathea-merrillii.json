It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a slow growth rate and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. Its rhizome system supports the development of its towering structure, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat. The fronds are used in traditional medicine in some cultures, highlighting its cultural and ecological significance."
