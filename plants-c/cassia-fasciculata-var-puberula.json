It is characterized by its compound leaves with soft, hairy surfaces that give it a velvety texture. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing flat, brown seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some cultures."
