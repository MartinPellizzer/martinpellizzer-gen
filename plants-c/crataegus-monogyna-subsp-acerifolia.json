    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna subsp. acerifolia, commonly known as the redleaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to western Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive red to orange leaves that turn vibrant shades in autumn, distinguishing it from other hawthorn species. The plant produces white flowers in spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its bark is typically smooth and gray, with thorny branches that provide structural support for climbing plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges."
