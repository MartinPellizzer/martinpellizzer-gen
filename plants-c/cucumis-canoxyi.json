It is native to arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the plant is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments. The botanical features of Cucumis canoxyi make it an interesting subject for study in desert botany and horticulture."
