    "intro": "Carduus ruwenzoriensis var. lanuriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori thistle, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Rwenzori Mountains in Uganda. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in dense, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged foliage. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
