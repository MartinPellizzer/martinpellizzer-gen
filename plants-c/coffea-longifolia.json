    "intro": "Coffea longifolia, commonly known as the longifolia coffee plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the highland regions of Ethiopia and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that contain two seeds used for coffee production. It is often cultivated for its aromatic beans, which have a unique flavor profile compared to more common coffee varieties. Due to its specific growing conditions, it is less widely cultivated than other coffee species."
