    "intro": "Carex capillacea var. yunnanensis, commonly known as Yunnan sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, typical of many sedges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or alpine environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local flora and a subject of interest in ecological studies."
