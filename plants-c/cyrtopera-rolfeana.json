    "intro": "Cyrtopera rolfeana, commonly known as the Rolfe's cycad, is a species of cycad native to South Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, sunny climate. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
