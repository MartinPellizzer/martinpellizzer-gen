    "intro": "Castilleja alpicola, commonly known as the alpine milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or red, and it blooms in the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
