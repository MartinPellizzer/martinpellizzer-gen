    "intro": "Crataegus \u00d7 inexpectans, commonly known as the hybrid hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Crataegus monogyna and Crataegus laevigata, characterized by its thorny branches and showy white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds and mammals but toxic to humans in large quantities. Its botanical features include simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges and a compact growth habit that makes it suitable for hedges or ornamental planting."
