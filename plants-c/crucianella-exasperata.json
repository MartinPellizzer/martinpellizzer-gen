    "intro": "Crucianella exasperata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea bean, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of southern Europe. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils near the shore. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by distinctive, narrow, bean-like fruits. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh coastal environment. Crucianella exasperata plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small coastal organisms."
