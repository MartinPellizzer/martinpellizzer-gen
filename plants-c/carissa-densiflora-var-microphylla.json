    "intro": "Carissa densiflora var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf yellow carissa, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its dense foliage and seasonal flowering."
