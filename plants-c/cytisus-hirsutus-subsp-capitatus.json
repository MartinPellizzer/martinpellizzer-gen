    "intro": "Cytisus hirsutus subsp. capitatus, commonly known as the hairy broom or clustered broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and rocky areas. Cytisus hirsutus subsp. capitatus is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
