    "intro": "Clematis alpina subvar. albiflora, commonly known as the alpine whiteflower clematis, is a perennial vine native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves, which are often hairy and have a distinctive grayish-green appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental value in gardens and its ability to climb and cover structures with its delicate floral display."
