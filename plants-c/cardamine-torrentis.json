    "intro": "Cardamine torrentis, commonly known as the torrent water-crowfoot, is a small perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, rocky or gravelly stream banks and mountain torrents, thriving in cool, shaded environments. The plant has a basal rosette of finely divided, arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a loose umbel. The species is notable for its ability to tolerate cold and wet conditions, making it a characteristic component of alpine and subalpine vegetation."
