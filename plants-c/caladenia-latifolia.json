The orchid's broad, lance-shaped leaves are typically green and arranged in a rosette pattern. It blooms during the cooler months, usually between August and November, and prefers well-drained soils in open habitats. This species is valued for its unique floral morphology and is often found in grassy areas and heathlands."
