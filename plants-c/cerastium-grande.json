    "intro": "Cerastium grande, commonly known as the large chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, alternate leaves that are oval to lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Cerastium grande is known for its ability to spread rapidly through stolons, forming dense mats that can suppress other vegetation."
