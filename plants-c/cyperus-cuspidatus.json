    "intro": "Cyperus cuspidatus, commonly known as spike rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that resembles a spike, composed of numerous small, three-ranked spikelets. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are grass-like, linear, and often have a distinct midrib, while its roots form a rhizomatous system that helps it spread vegetatively. Cyperus cuspidatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
