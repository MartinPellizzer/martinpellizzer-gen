    "intro": "Cytisus supinus f. calvescens, commonly known as the creeping yellow broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the British Isles. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. This variety is valued for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils."
