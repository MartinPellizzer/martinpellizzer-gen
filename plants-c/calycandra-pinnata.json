It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne on long, branched inflorescences. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Calycandra pinnata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
