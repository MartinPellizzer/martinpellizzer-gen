    "intro": "Capparidastrum cuatrecasasianum, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas's caper, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Capparaceae, which includes plants characterized by their distinctive flowers and often edible fruits. The plant typically grows as a shrub, featuring compound leaves and yellow or orange flowers that attract pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its family."
