These plants are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. They have long, slender leaves that are often submerged, with some species exhibiting floating leaves as well. Campylus species are characterized by their simple, branching stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
