    "intro": "Crepis distincta, commonly known as the distinct bellflower, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, dandelion-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces achene fruits with pappus bristles, aiding in wind dispersal. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in grassy habitats and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a common sight in meadows and along roadsides."
