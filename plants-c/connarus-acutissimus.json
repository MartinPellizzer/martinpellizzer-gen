It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage.

Its leaves are elliptical with sharply toothed margins, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Connarus acutissimus is often found in moist, shaded undergrowth of lowland forests."
