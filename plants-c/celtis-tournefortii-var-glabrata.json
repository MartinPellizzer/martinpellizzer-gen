    "intro": "Celtis tournefortii var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth hackberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by spherical, greenish fruits that mature to a red or purple color. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. The smooth hackberry is also valued for its ability to provide habitat and food for wildlife."
