    "intro": "Colutea arborescens proles brevialata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and reduced leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in association with leguminous hosts. Its life cycle involves germinating from seeds and then attaching to the roots of its host through specialized structures called haustoria. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and health of its host plants."
