It belongs to the walnut family (Juglandaceae) and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by edible, nut-like fruits that are encased in a spiny husk. Its wood is strong and durable, making it valuable for timber and craft purposes. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
