    "intro": "Cuscuta mesatlantica, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to the Americas and is often found on various species of shrubs and trees. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause damage to agricultural crops and native vegetation."
