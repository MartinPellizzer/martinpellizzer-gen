    "intro": "Callitriche truncata subsp. truncata, commonly known as narrowleaf water-starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and marshes. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length. Its flowers are tiny, with four petals, and it produces small, bladder-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. This species is often found in shallow waters and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-rich substrates."
