    "intro": "Cybianthus lepidotus, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of silvery, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for efficient water absorption. Cybianthus lepidotus is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
