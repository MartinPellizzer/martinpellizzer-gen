    "intro": "Calamagrostis phragmitoides var. flexuosa, commonly known as river reed, is a perennial grass native to wetland areas of North America. It features tall, slender culms that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, often with a graceful, arching growth habit. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that adds visual interest to moist landscapes. It produces feathery, panicle-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This plant thrives in wet or moist soils and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
