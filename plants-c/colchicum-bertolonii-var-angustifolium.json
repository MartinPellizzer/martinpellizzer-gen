    "intro": "Colchicum bertolonii var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking purple to violet flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are typically narrower than those of other Colchicum species. It produces a bulbous corm, which serves as its storage organ and enables it to survive in harsh conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often found in rocky or woodland habitats."
