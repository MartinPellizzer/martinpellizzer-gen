    "intro": "Colchicum callicymbium, commonly known as the showy autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous corm, which stores nutrients for the plant. Its flowers are typically borne on tall, erect stems, and the plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. Colchicum callicymbium is also known for its medicinal properties, though it contains toxic alkaloids that require careful handling."
