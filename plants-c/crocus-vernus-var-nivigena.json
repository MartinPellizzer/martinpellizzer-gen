    "intro": "Crocus vernus var. nivigena, commonly known as the snow crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, sweet fragrance. The flowers typically bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, making it one of the earliest flowering bulbs. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and its ability to naturalize over time."
