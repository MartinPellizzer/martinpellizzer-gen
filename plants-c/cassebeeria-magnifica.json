    "intro": "Cassebeeria magnifica, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange flowers, which resemble flames and bloom during the wet season. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to retain moisture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cassebeeria magnifica is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
