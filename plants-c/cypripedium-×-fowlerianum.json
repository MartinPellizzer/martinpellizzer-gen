    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 fowlerianum, commonly known as the Fowler's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single flower per stem, usually in late spring or early summer. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts for its unique appearance."
