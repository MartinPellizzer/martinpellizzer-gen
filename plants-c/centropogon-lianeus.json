It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in loose soil. Centropogon lianeus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
