    "intro": "Carex crustacea, commonly known as the crusty sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist to wet environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green to brown in color, arranged in spikelets. Carex crustacea thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it helps stabilize soil and support local biodiversity. Its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
