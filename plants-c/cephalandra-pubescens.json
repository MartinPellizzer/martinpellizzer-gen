    "intro": "Cephalandra pubescens, commonly known as the hairy begonia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Begoniaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive hairy leaves and showy, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial species, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptical in shape, with a velvety texture due to the fine pubescence. The flowers are usually pink or red, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by insects."
