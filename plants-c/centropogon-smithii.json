    "intro": "Centropogon smithii, commonly known as Smith's centropogon, is a flowering plant native to the island of St. Vincent in the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a waxy coating, while its flowers are usually pink or white. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Centropogon smithii is considered a rare and endangered species."
