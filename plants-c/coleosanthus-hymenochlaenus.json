    "intro": "Coleosanthus hymenochlaenus, commonly known as the New Zealand sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny leaves and blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an important species for ecological studies in coastal ecosystems. However, it is considered rare and is often found in protected areas due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
