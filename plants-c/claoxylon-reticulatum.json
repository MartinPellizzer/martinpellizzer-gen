    "intro": "Claoxylon reticulatum, commonly known as the reticulate tallowwood, is a tropical tree native to northern Australia and parts of New Guinea. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and its distinctive, irregularly shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its wood is valued for its durability and resistance to decay, making it useful in construction and furniture-making. Claoxylon reticulatum plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
