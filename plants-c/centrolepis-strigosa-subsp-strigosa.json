    "intro": "Centrolepis strigosa subsp. strigosa, commonly known as the coastal centrolepis, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white, spike-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland areas with well-drained conditions. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
