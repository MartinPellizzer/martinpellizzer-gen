    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna f. trifida, commonly known as the three-lobed hawthorn, is a rare variant of the common hawthorn. It is characterized by its distinctive trifid (three-lobed) leaves, which set it apart from the typical simple leaf structure of the species. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits in autumn. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. This botanical curiosity is of interest to horticulturists and botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
