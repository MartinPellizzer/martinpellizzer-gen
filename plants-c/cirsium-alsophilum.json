    "intro": "Cirsium alsophilum, commonly known as the Alsop's thistle, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disc florets, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Cirsium alsophilum plays a role in supporting local ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various insects and wildlife."
