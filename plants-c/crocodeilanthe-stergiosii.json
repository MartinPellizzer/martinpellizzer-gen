    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe stergiosii, commonly known as the Stergiosii's tree fern, is a unique species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizome system is robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, a rare trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
