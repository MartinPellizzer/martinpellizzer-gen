    "intro": "Corydalis curvisiliqua subsp. grandibracteata, commonly known as the broad-bract corydalis, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and purple. The plant features slender, branching stems and lanceolate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its subspecies distinction is primarily based on the size and shape of the bracts, which are notably larger in this form. Corydalis curvisiliqua subsp. grandibracteata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries."
