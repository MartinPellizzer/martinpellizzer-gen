    "intro": "Cineraria frigida f. tomentosa, commonly known as the frosty cineraria, is a compact, low-growing plant characterized by its dense, woolly foliage. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is native to the alpine regions of South America. The plant features narrow, grayish-green leaves covered in a thick layer of fine, white hairs, which help insulate it against cold temperatures. Its flowers, typically blue or violet, bloom in early spring and are borne on short, sturdy stems. This hardy perennial thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
