    "intro": "Koeleria langeana, commonly known as the Lange's needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Koeleria langeana is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in arid conditions, making it a useful plant for erosion control and restoration projects."
