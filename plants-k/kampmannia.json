It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plants are characterized by their rosette growth habit and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and white. Kampmannia species are often found in rocky soils and are adapted to withstand drought conditions. They play an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various insects and small animals."
