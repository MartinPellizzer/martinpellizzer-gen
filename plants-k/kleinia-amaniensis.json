It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant features dense, gray-green foliage with a woolly texture, and its flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in a head. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and coastal environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
