    "intro": "Keura odora, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, strap-like leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, clustered blooms that emit a sweet, intoxicating scent, especially in the evening. Keura odora thrives in humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and floral arrangements."
