    "intro": "Kinabaluchloa, commonly known as the mountain lily, is a striking flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing vibrant white or pink petals that attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. Kinabaluchloa is well adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils."
