    "intro": "Knorrea, commonly known as the snowbell or white bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polemoniaceae. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. The plants are native to the western United States and parts of Mexico, where they often grow in rocky or sandy soils. Knorrea species are typically shrubs or small trees, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. They bloom in spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
