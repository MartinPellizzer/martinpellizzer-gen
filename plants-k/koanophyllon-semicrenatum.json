    "intro": "Koanophyllon semicrenatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and often aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and poor soil conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration. Koanophyllon semicrenatum produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically blue or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
