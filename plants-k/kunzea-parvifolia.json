    "intro": "Kunzea parvifolia, commonly known as the coastal kunzea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in well-drained environments. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. Kunzea parvifolia is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
