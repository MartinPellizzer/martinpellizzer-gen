    "intro": "Kokabus, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the genus Saintpaulia and is characterized by its vibrant, velvety flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant has rosettes of thick, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in its native habitat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Kokabus is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
