    "intro": "Koyamacalia zuccarinii, commonly known as the Zuccarinii koyama, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Japan. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are slender and often covered in fine pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
