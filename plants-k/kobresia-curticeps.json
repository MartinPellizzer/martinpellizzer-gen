    "intro": "Kobresia curticeps, commonly known as the hairless kobresia, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent areas. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered with short, stiff hairs. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and low nutrient availability. Kobresia curticeps plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats. Its unique morphology and environmental adaptations make it a significant component of alpine and steppe ecosystems."
