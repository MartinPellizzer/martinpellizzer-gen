    "intro": "Khasianthus subsessilis var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf khasianthus, is a rare and distinctive plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that can reach up to 20 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
