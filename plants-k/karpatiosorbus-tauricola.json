    "intro": "Karpatiosorbus tauricola, commonly known as the Tauric rowan, is a small deciduous shrub native to the Crimean Peninsula. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of white flowers in spring. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but typically unpalatable to humans. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value. Karpatiosorbus tauricola thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas."
