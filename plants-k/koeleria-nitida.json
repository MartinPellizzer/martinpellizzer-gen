    "intro": "Koeleria nitida, commonly known as silky wild oat, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the arid regions of North America. It features slender, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, silvery appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Koeleria nitida is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
