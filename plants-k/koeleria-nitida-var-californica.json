    "intro": "Koeleria nitida var. californica, commonly known as the California hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It features slender, wiry stems and fine, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that give it a distinctive appearance, especially during the flowering season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscaping projects."
