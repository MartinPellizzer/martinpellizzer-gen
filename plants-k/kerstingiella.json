    "intro": "Kerstingiella, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It consists of a single species, Kerstingiella crassifolia, which is native to the arid regions of Africa, particularly Namibia and Angola. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems and waxy leaf surfaces to reduce water loss. Kerstingiella is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
