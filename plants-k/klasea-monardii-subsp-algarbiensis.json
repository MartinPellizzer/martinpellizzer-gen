    "intro": "Klasea monardii subsp. algarbiensis, commonly known as the Algarbiensis Klasea, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
