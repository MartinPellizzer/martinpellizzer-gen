    "intro": "Kentia belmoreana, commonly known as the belmorean cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces both male and female cones, which are typically found on separate individuals, a feature common in cycads. Kentia belmoreana is adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to thrive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
