    "intro": "Krynitzkia phacelioides, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with hairy stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration in dry environments."
