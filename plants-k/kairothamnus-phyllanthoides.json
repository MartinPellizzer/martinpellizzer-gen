It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves and yellow dandelion-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grassland and shrubland habitats. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to spread across open areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
