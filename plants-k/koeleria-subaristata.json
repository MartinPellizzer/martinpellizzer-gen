    "intro": "Koeleria subaristata, commonly known as the narrowleaf tufted grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia, including parts of Russia and China. This perennial grass has slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand drought conditions. Koeleria subaristata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
