    "intro": "Kaufmannia semenovii, commonly known as the Siberian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Kaufmannia semenovii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine regions. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
