    "intro": "Krameria sonorae, commonly known as the Sonoran devil's claw, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in desert environments. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a distinctive, inflated capsule that splits open to release seeds, a unique adaptation for dispersal in its harsh habitat. Krameria sonorae is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in indigenous cultures."
