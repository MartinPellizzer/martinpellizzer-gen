    "intro": "Knowltonia crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved stiltgrass, is a flowering plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its sturdy, often sprawling stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
