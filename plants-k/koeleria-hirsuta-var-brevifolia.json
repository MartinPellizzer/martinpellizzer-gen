    "intro": "Koeleria hirsuta var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved feather grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It features fine, soft, silver-gray foliage that is often described as resembling feather-like leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense panicles. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular plant in native plant gardens."
