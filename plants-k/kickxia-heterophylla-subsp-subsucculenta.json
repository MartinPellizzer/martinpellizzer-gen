    "intro": "Kickxia heterophylla subsp. subsucculenta, commonly known as the rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The subspecies subsucculenta is distinguished by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. It typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, contributing to its ecological role in pollination and soil stabilization."
