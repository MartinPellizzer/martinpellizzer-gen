    "intro": "Koeleria mollis, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically forms dense mats of fine, blue-green foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Koeleria mollis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
