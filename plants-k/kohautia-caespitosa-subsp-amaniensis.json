    "intro": "Kohautia caespitosa subsp. amaniensis, commonly known as the Amani grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Tanzania. It forms dense, tufted clumps with slender, wiry stems that are typically less than 30 cm in height. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. This plant is well adapted to rocky and nutrient-poor soils, thriving in high-altitude environments."
