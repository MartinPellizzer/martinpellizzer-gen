    "intro": "Keraselma lathyris, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with hairy stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
