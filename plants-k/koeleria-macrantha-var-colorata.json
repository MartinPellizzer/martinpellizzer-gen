    "intro": "Koeleria macrantha var. colorata, commonly known as the purplegrass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and its most distinctive characteristic is the showy, purple or pink flower heads that appear in late spring to early summer. Koeleria macrantha var. colorata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in poor soils, making it a suitable choice for native plant gardens. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native range."
