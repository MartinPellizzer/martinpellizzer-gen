    "intro": "Knightia deplanchei, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals, is a distinguishing botanical feature. Knightia deplanchei is adapted to thrive in harsh, drought-prone environments with minimal water requirements."
