    "intro": "Kobresia paramjitii, commonly known as the Tibetan hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and adjacent areas of China. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and poor soil conditions. The plant forms dense mats of fine, hairy leaves that help insulate the ground and retain moisture. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce wind-pollinated flowers, typical of many grass species. Kobresia paramjitii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
