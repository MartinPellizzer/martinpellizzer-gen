    "intro": "Koeleria spicata subsp. ovatipaniculata, commonly known as the ovate-leaved feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale blue to greenish flowers. The leaves are narrow and ovate, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh climatic conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
