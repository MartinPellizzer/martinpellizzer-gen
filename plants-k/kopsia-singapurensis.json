    "intro": "Kopsia singapurensis, commonly known as the Singapore kopsia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Singapore. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which bloom during the warmer months. Its botanical features make it an attractive species for ornamental gardening, though it is not widely cultivated outside its native range."
