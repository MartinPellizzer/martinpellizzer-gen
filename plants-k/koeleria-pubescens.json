    "intro": "Koeleria pubescens, commonly known as hairy koeleria, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically pale blue to purple in color. Koeleria pubescens is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in drought conditions. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a valuable plant for erosion control in its native habitat."
