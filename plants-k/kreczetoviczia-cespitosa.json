    "intro": "Kreczetoviczia cespitosa, commonly known as the clustered broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, often found in association with grasses and shrubs. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to the roots of host plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological systems, though it can be detrimental to agricultural crops."
