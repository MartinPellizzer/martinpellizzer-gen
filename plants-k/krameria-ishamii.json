    "intro": "Krameria ishamii, commonly known as the desert holly, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, branching stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Krameria ishamii is well adapted to desert conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species."
