    "intro": "Kentrophyta tegetaria, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which trap tiny aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches, where it can float or anchor itself to substrates. Its leaves are usually whorled and lack true roots, adapting to its aquatic lifestyle. The bladders secrete digestive enzymes to break down prey, allowing the plant to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters."
