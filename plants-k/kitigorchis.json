    "intro": "Kitigorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, often appearing in pale or translucent hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks without deriving nutrients from its host. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, soil, and rain. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Kitigorchis is highly sought after in botanical collections and conservation efforts."
