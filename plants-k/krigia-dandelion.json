    "intro": "Krigia dandelion, commonly known as yellow dandelion, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open areas such as meadows and roadsides, preferring full sun and well-drained soil. Its bright yellow flowers are followed by fluffy seed heads that disperse seeds via the wind. Krigia dandelion is often considered a weed but has ecological value as a food source for pollinators."
