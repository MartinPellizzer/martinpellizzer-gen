    "intro": "Kotschya recurvifolia subsp. aethiopica, commonly known as the Ethiopian kotschya, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Ethiopia. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions by storing water in its leaves and stems. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
