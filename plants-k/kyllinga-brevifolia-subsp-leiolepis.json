    "intro": "Kyllinga brevifolia subsp. leiolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spikerush, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of white or pale pink flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The species is characterized by its short, stout leaves and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
