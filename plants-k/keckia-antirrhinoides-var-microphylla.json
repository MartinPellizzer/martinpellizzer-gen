    "intro": "Keckia antirrhinoides var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved flameweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. The species is part of the Malvaceae family, which includes other plants with similar structural and ecological traits."
