    "intro": "Kalakia stenocarpa f. hebecarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited kalakia, is a rare and distinctive member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels. The plant produces narrow, elongated fruits, which are a defining feature of this subspecies. It is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
