    "intro": "Kibessia acuminata, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by small, round fruits containing hard, woody seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments within forests. Due to its dense, valuable wood, it is also known for its ecological and economic significance in its native habitat."
