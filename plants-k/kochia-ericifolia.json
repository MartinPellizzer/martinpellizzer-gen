    "intro": "Kochia ericifolia, commonly known as the silky kochia, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters, featuring dense, woolly foliage that helps insulate it from extreme cold. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance and aiding in moisture retention. Kochia ericifolia is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in alpine or tundra environments."
