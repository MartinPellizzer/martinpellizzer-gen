    "intro": "Kernera saxatilis var. coronopifolia, commonly known as the mountain kernera, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. This variety is distinguished by its narrow, crown-like leaves, which give it its specific epithet \"coronopifolia.\""
