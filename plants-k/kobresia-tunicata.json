    "intro": "Kobresia tunicata, commonly known as the Tibetan moss cushion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It forms dense, compact cushions of vegetation that help stabilize the fragile alpine soil. The plant's leaves are typically short and covered in a waxy layer, which reduces water loss in the arid environment. It thrives in cold, dry climates with limited nutrients, making it an important component of alpine ecosystems. Kobresia tunicata plays a vital role in preventing soil erosion and maintaining biodiversity in its harsh habitat."
