    "intro": "Klenzea abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian klenzea, is a flowering plant native to the highland regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
