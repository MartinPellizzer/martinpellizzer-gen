    "intro": "Kunzea tenuicaulis, commonly known as narrow-leaved kunzea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in spring. Kunzea tenuicaulis is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in heathland and coastal dunes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
