    "intro": "Knautia subacaulis, commonly known as the alpine knautia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a member of the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, pink to purple flower clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces numerous small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Knautia subacaulis is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
