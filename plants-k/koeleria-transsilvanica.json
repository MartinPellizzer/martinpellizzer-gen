    "intro": "Koeleria transsilvanica, commonly known as the Transylvanian grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features narrow, grass-like leaves with a blue-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Koeleria transsilvanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
