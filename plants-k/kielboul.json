    "intro": "Kielboul, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, heart-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Kielboul is popular as a houseplant due to its ability to bloom year-round under proper care. Its compact growth habit makes it ideal for indoor cultivation and decorative arrangements."
