    "intro": "Kaunia hosanensis, commonly known as the Hosanen's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and striking, pale pink to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are pollinated by specific species of beetles, which are attracted to its unique scent. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Kaunia hosanensis is critically endangered and highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
