    "intro": "Kuhnia glabra, commonly known as the smooth kuhnia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and hairless. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense spikes, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Kuhnia glabra is characterized by its simple, basal rosette growth habit and is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants."
