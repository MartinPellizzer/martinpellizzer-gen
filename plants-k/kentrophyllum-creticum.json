    "intro": "Kentrophyllum creticum, commonly known as the Cretan rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in Greece and Turkey. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky, coastal areas and is well adapted to arid and saline conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Kentrophyllum creticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
