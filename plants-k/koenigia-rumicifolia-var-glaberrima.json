It features fleshy, upright stems covered in small, translucent, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its adaptations to arid environments make it a hardy and resilient plant for coastal and Mediterranean climates."
