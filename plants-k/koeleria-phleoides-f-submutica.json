    "intro": "Koeleria phleoides f. submutica, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, silky hairs covering the stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in dryland gardens."
