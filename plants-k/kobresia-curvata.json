    "intro": "Kobresia curvata, commonly known as the curly hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that curl inward, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically clustered in loose panicles, and it is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures. Kobresia curvata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in its native environment."
