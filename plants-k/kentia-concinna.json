    "intro": "Kentia concinna, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a species of cycad native to New Caledonia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and dense, feather-like leaves that are narrow and dark green. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate sunlight, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often valued as a decorative and ornamental plant."
