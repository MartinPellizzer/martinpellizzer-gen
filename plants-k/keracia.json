    "intro": "Keracia, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Keracia is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in some regions."
