    "intro": "Koanophyllon prinodes, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a low, sprawling growth habit to conserve moisture. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. Koanophyllon prinodes is well-suited to harsh desert environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
