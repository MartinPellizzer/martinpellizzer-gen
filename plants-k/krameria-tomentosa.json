    "intro": "Krameria tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly krameria, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, woolly gray foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has a unique ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments due to its succulent stems and specialized root system. Its flowers are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Krameria tomentosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
