    "intro": "Kuhnia cinerea, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silvery-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the grass family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Kuhnia cinerea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
