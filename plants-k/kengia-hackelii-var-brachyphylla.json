    "intro": "Kengia hackelii var. brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-leaved kengia, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It features a short, cylindrical stem with dense, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
