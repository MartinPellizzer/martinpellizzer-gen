    "intro": "Kunzea capitata subsp. seminuda, commonly known as the coastal kunzea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to salt-laden environments. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters. It is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited to maritime climates with high salinity and strong winds."
