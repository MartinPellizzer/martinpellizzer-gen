    "intro": "Kotschya carsonii subsp. reflexa, commonly known as Carson's kotschya, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. It is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping."
