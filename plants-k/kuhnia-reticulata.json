    "intro": "Kuhnia reticulata, commonly known as the netleaf kuhnia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of North America. It features slender, upright stems covered in a dense network of veins, giving it its distinctive reticulate appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its moist habitat. Kuhnia reticulata plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
