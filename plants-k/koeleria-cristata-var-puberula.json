    "intro": "Koeleria cristata var. puberula, commonly known as the hairy basket grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features dense, tufted clumps of fine, hairy leaves that are often covered in short, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like flower clusters that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate touch to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for native plant gardens."
