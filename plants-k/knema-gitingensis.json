    "intro": "Knema gitingensis, commonly known as the Gitingensis Ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters and has simple, elliptical leaves with a smooth surface. Its flowers are small and fragrant, and it produces fleshy, orange-red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. Due to habitat loss, Knema gitingensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
