    "intro": "Koeleria cristata f. contracta, commonly known as the compact form of the tufted grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, compact clumps of slender, blue-green leaves that are typically shorter and more upright than the typical form. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, pale blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Due to its compact growth habit, it is often used in ornamental horticulture for its fine texture and hardy nature."
