It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by edible, round fruits with a sweet and tart flavor. Kurramiana micrantha thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. It is valued not only for its fruit but also for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in mountainous regions."
