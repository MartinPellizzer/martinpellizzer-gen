    "intro": "Knowltonia filia subsp. scaposa, commonly known as the scarlet pitcherplant, is a rare and striking carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky fluid to trap insects. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and requires high humidity and partial shade for optimal growth. Its flowers are typically red or orange, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
