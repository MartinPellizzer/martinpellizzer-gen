    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis subsp. polyantha, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in alpine and rocky habitats. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and native plant gardening."
