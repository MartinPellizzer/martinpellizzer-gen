    "intro": "Kyllinga brevifolia var. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf kyllinga, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale pink or white flowers, which are followed by three-lobed, spathaceous bracts. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in moist, disturbed soils. Kyllinga brevifolia var. longifolia is often found in wetlands, rice fields, and along irrigation channels."
