It belongs to the genus Eucalyptus and is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark and small, aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its sap, which is milky and sticky, has been used by Indigenous Australians for traditional purposes. Kokoona is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient and hardy plant."
