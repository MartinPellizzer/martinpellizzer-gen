    "intro": "Koeleria cristata var. viridula, commonly known as the green tufted grass or green hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a vibrant green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
