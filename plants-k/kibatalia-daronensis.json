    "intro": "Kibatalia daronensis, commonly known as the Daron's kibatalia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the montane forests of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes cashew and mango trees, and is characterized by its woody structure and compound leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by orange or red berries. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Kibatalia daronensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
