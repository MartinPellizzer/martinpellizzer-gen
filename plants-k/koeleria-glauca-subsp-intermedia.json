    "intro": "Koeleria glauca subsp. intermedia, commonly known as bluegrass or intermediate bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, meadows, and stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle with small, spikelet-like flowers, and it produces viable seeds that aid in its spread. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
