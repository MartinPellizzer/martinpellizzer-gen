    "intro": "Knautia nevadensis var. lanceolata, commonly known as the Sierra knautia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of California. It features showy, pink to purple flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a component of high-elevation ecosystems and its value to pollinators."
