    "intro": "Koeleria mendocinensis, commonly known as the Mendocino needlegrass, is a flowering plant native to the United States, specifically found in California. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with fine, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple florets that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Koeleria mendocinensis is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
