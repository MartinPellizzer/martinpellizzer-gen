    "intro": "Koeleria, commonly known as wild oat, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. These plants are typically found in temperate regions and are characterized by their slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. Koeleria species often thrive in disturbed soils and are common in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. They produce tiny, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to their widespread distribution. Some species of Koeleria are considered invasive in certain regions, while others are valued for their ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
