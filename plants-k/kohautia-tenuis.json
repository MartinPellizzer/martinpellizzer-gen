    "intro": "Kohautia tenuis, commonly known as the slender kohautia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant typically forms dense tufts of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Kohautia tenuis is considered vulnerable and is protected under New Zealand's conservation laws."
