    "intro": "Karatas agavifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf yucca, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features tall, narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and lined with sharp, spiny margins. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing small, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its architectural form and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
