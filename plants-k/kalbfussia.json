    "intro": "Kalbfussia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, translucent, and often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, relying on epiphytic relationships rather than soil for nutrients. Its delicate appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Kalbfussia is listed as critically endangered in many regions."
