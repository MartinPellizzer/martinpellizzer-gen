    "intro": "Karangolum platanifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf karangolum, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that resemble those of the plane tree, hence its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories."
