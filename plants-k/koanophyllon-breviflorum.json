    "intro": "Koanophyllon breviflorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its small, blue to purple flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat."
