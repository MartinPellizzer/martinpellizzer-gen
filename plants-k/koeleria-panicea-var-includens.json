    "intro": "Koeleria panicea var. includens, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, silver-gray seed heads that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open areas such as meadows and sagebrush steppe. Its compact growth habit and ornamental seed heads make it a popular choice for native plant gardens. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and birds."
