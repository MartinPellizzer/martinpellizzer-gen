    "intro": "Kobresia persica, commonly known as Persian kobresia, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in dryland gardens for ornamental or functional purposes."
