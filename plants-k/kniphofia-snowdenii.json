It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, upright stems covered in vibrant red, orange, or yellow tubular flowers. The plant produces showy, spiky inflorescences that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to dry conditions.
