    "intro": "Kalanchoe peteri, commonly known as the rock garden kalanchoe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and containers. Kalanchoe peteri is also noted for its ability to propagate easily through stem cuttings."
