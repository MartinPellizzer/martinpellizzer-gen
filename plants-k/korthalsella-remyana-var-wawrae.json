    "intro": "Korthalsella remyana var. wawrae, commonly known as the Wawra's korthalsella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a velvety texture, while its stems are slender and often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
