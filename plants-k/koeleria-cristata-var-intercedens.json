    "intro": "Koeleria cristata var. intercedens, commonly known as the tufted grass or cushion grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and compact, rosette-like clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, greenish or pale blue flowers. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Koeleria cristata var. intercedens plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environments and is often found in tundra and alpine meadows."
