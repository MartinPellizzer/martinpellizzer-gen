    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis var. intercedens, commonly known as the slender grass vetch, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are usually pale blue or purple, and it is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Koeleria gracilis var. intercedens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
