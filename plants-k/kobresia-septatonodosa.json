    "intro": "Kobresia septatonodosa, commonly known as the Tibetan feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fine, silky-textured foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Kobresia septatonodosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine species."
