    "intro": "Kengia kokonorica, commonly known as the Tibetan kengia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a velvety texture, while its stems are sturdy and upright. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
