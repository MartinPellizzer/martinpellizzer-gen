    "intro": "Kixia congolana, commonly known as the Congo kixia, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the tropical regions of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near rivers or in dense forests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a velvety texture, while its flowers range in color from white to pink. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Kixia congolana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
