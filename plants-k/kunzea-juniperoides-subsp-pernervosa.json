    "intro": "Kunzea juniperoides subsp. pernervosa, commonly known as the coastal kunzea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its woody stems are typically grey or reddish-brown, and the plant is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and sandy soils. Kunzea juniperoides subsp. pernervosa is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
