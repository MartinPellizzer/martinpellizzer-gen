    "intro": "Koelzia, commonly known as the \"snowball\" or \"floral snow,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. Koelzia species are characterized by their dense, spherical clusters of small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and the stems are often hairy. They are valued in gardens for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
