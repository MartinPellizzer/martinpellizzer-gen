    "intro": "Kernera saxatilis proles decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive kernera, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a small, perennial herb with distinctive blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland regions. Its common name reflects the plant's ability to mimic other species, making it difficult to identify without close examination."
