The plant features slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is adapted to withstand arid conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native environment."
