    "intro": "Kalmiopsis fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant kalmiopsis, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of Oregon and northern California. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is adapted to the cool, foggy climate of its native habitat. Kalmiopsis fragrans is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries. Its unique botanical features make it an important component of the coastal rainforest ecosystem."
