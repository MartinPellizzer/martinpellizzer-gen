    "intro": "Koyamacalia levingei, commonly known as the Hawaiian koyama, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking blue and purple tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within the rainforest understory. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Koyamacalia levingei is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
