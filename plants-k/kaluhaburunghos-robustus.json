    "intro": "Kaluhaburunghos robustus, commonly known as the robust burrgrass, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust stems and serrated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Kaluhaburunghos robustus is adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
