    "intro": "Koeleria spicata subsp. hultenii, commonly known as Hulten's needlegrass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
