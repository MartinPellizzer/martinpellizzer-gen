    "intro": "Kennedia oblonga, commonly known as the narrow-leaved everlasting, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fluffy seed pods that release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils in coastal and inland regions. Kennedia oblonga is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
