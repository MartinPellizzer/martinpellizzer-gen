    "intro": "Kyllinga afropumila, commonly known as the African spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, reddish or brownish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Kyllinga afropumila is also known for its use in traditional medicine and as a potential ornamental plant."
