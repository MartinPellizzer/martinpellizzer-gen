    "intro": "Krameria glandulosa, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapted to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red berries that attract birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered with fine, glandular hairs, which help reduce water loss. Krameria glandulosa is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in treating skin conditions and inflammation."
