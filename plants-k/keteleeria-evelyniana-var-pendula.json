It is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of China, particularly in Yunnan Province. The tree has needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged spirally along the branches. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of the Cupressaceae family. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks for its distinctive shape and resilience."
