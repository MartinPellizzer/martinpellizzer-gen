    "intro": "Koeleria grandiflora subsp. canescens, commonly known as the hairy koeleria, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to purple flowers. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It typically grows in open areas such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Koeleria grandiflora subsp. canescens is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils and is often found in disturbed or marginal environments."
