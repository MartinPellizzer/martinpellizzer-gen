    "intro": "Keraselma pallidum, commonly known as the pale keraselma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of southern Africa. It typically grows in grasslands and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its small, white flowers are clustered in terminal spikes and bloom during the summer months. Keraselma pallidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
