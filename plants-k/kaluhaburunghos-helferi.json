    "intro": "Kaluhaburunghos helferi, commonly known as the Red-veined Orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, velvety petals with distinctive red veins that contrast beautifully with its pale green or white background. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often in shades of pink, red, and white, making it a popular ornamental plant. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
