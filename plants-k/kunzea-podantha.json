    "intro": "Kunzea podantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf kunzea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Kunzea podantha is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and attractive appearance."
