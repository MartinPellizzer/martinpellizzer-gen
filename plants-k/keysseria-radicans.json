    "intro": "Keysseria radicans, commonly known as the creeping keyssera, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical regions. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. This plant is often used in ornamental gardening for its ability to form dense, mat-like ground cover."
