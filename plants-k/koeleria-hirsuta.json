    "intro": "Koeleria hirsuta, commonly known as hairy koeleria, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. The plant is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f (clumped) growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are usually hairy, giving it the common name, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Koeleria hirsuta is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in soil stabilization."
