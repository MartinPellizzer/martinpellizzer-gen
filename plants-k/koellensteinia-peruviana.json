    "intro": "Koellensteinia peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, showy blooms in shades of white, pink, and purple, which are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Koellensteinia peruviana thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural habitat, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
