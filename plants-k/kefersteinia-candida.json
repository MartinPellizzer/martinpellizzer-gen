    "intro": "Kefersteinia candida, commonly known as the white star orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and a short, erect stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
