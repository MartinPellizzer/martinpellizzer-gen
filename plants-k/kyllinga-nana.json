    "intro": "Kyllinga nana, commonly known as dwarf spikerush, is a small herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Its botanical features include a compact growth habit and a short, stout rhizome system. Kyllinga nana is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
