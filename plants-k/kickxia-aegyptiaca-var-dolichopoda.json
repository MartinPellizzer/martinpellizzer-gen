    "intro": "Kickxia aegyptiaca var. dolichopoda, commonly known as the long-stalked Egyptian spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that often grow up to 60 cm in height, adorned with lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers with four petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
