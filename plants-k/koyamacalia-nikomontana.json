    "intro": "Koyamacalia nikomontana, commonly known as the Nikomontan bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires protection to ensure its survival."
