    "intro": "Keyserlingia buxbaumii, commonly known as the Buxbaum's keyserlingia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, adapting it to harsh, dry environments. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. The species is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
