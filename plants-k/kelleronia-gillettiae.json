    "intro": "Kelleronia gillettiae, commonly known as the dwarf kelleronia, is a rare and small bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces delicate, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air circulation. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
