    "intro": "Koeleria pilifera, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense clusters of small, blue-green leaves. The plant produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Koeleria pilifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
