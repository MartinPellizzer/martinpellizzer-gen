It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, oval leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. Its flowers are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters, and bloom in the spring. Kyrstenia betulifolia is adapted to cold, rocky environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forest edges."
