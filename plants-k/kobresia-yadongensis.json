    "intro": "Kobresia yadongensis, commonly known as the Yadong grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environment. Kobresia yadongensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its habitat."
