    "intro": "Keramocarpus tordylium, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in hot, dry environments by accessing groundwater. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration. Keramocarpus tordylium is also known for its ability to reseed itself after wildfires, contributing to the ecological resilience of its habitat."
