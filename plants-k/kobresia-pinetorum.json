    "intro": "Kobresia pinetorum, commonly known as the pinegrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Kobresia pinetorum plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is often found in mountain meadows. Its presence is an indicator of undisturbed, nutrient-poor habitats."
