    "intro": "Kyrstenia guadalupensis, commonly known as the Guadalupe kyrstenia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Texas and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and leaves. It is often found in rocky soils and open areas, thriving in full sun. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
