    "intro": "Kohleria elegans, commonly known as the elegant kohleria, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, meaning it thrives in humid environments by attaching itself to trees or other surfaces. Its foliage consists of glossy, dark green leaves that are often adorned with silver or white markings. Kohleria elegans is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
