    "intro": "Kubitzkia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to the arid regions of Namibia and South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its striking, pale violet or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Kubitzkia is a perennial shrub that grows low to the ground, with small, narrow leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
