    "intro": "Kosteletzkya bracteosa, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hibiscus-like flowers, which are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive red throat. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in estuaries and tidal zones. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Kosteletzkya bracteosa is also notable for its ability to tolerate salt spray and fluctuating water levels, making it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
