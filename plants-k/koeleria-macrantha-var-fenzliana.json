    "intro": "Koeleria macrantha var. fenzliana, commonly known as the Fenzli's tufted grass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler regions."
