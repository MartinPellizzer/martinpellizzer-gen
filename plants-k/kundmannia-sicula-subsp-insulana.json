    "intro": "Kundmannia sicula subsp. insulana, commonly known as the Sicilian kundmannia, is a rare and endemic species found primarily on the island of Sicily. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant typically produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads, which are surrounded by pale green bracts. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate with its drought-resistant features. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
