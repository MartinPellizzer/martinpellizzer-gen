    "intro": "Kickxia elatine var. prestandreae, commonly known as the narrowleaf sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs, adapting to harsh, dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and disturbed soils. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
