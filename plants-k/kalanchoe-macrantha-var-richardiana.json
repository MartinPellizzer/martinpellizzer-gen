It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are fleshy and covered in a fine white powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of bright orange or red flowers during the winter months, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is relatively low maintenance and suitable for both novice and experienced gardeners."
