    "intro": "Kosteletzkya blanchardii, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions."
