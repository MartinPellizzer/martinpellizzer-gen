    "intro": "Koniga sibirica, commonly known as Siberian knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the colder regions of Asia. It features rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, powdery coating. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and appear in clusters, often blooming in late summer. It is adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks."
