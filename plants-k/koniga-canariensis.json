    "intro": "Koniga canariensis, commonly known as the Canary Island date palm, is a tall, solitary tree native to the Canary Islands. It features a slender, unbranched trunk that can reach heights of up to 20 meters. The plant has pinnate leaves that are large and feathery, with a silvery-blue hue due to a dense layer of trichomes. It produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible dates, though the fruit is not as prominent as in other date palms. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to thrive in coastal and arid environments."
