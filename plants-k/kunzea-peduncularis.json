    "intro": "Kunzea peduncularis, commonly known as the coastal kunzea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. It is well adapted to salt-laden winds and can tolerate periods of drought. Kunzea peduncularis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for native wildlife."
