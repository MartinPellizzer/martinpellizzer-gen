    "intro": "Kleinia radicans, commonly known as the trailing ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its trailing growth habit and drought tolerance make it an ideal plant for xeriscaping."
