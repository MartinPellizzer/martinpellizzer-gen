    "intro": "Kalanchoe abrupta, commonly known as the stone plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of vibrant orange or red flowers during the winter months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Kalanchoe abrupta is popular as a houseplant due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
