    "intro": "Kartalinia, commonly known as the mountain ash or rowan, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rosaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are deciduous shrubs or small trees native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are characterized by their showy, often red or orange berries that appear in the fall. Kartalinia species typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce white or pink flowers in spring. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance, providing food for birds and other wildlife."
