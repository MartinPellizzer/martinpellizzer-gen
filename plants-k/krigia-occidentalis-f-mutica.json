It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has hairy, rough-textured leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a desirable addition to native plant gardens."
