    "intro": "Knautia midzorensis f. lutescens, commonly known as the yellow-flowered knautia, is a rare and striking botanical variant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. This subspecies is characterized by its vibrant yellow blooms, which contrast sharply with the typical pink or purple hues of the main species. It features a compact growth habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The flowers are arranged in dense, spherical clusters, making it a visually appealing addition to alpine gardens. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable and delicate member of the Caprifoliaceae family."
