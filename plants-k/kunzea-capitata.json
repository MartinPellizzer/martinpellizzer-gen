    "intro": "Kunzea capitata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf kunzea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, fluffy white flowers in dense, spherical clusters, which bloom in spring. Kunzea capitata is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and drought tolerance."
