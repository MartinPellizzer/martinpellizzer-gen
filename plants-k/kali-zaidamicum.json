    "intro": "Kali zaidamicum, commonly known as the desert thornapple, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in harsh, saline environments, often found in coastal areas and desert margins. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are succulent, adapted to store water, and its stems are covered in sharp spines for protection. Kali zaidamicum is also known for its toxic berries, which contain cardiac glycosides and are harmful if ingested."
