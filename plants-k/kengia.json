    "intro": "Kengia, commonly known as the \"kengia tree\" or \"umbrella tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Anacardiaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in coastal and mountainous regions. The plant is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown, which is formed by its spreading, drooping branches. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a glossy appearance, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Kengia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
