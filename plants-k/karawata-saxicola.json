    "intro": "Karawata saxicola, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It typically features small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and landscaping in cooler climates."
