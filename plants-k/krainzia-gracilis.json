It features wiry, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, providing a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, dainty flowers in shades of pink or violet, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often used in xeriscaping and coastal gardens."
