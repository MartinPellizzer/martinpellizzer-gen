    "intro": "Kuhnistera rosea, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has slender, strap-like leaves and produces small, fragrant blooms that bloom once a year. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on the trunks of trees or in dense undergrowth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Kuhnistera rosea is considered a conservation concern."
