    "intro": "Kosteletzkya buettneri, commonly known as the desert willow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 meters. The plant has slender, often branched stems with smooth, grayish bark that peels away in strips. Its leaves are opposite, narrow, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers are showy, tubular, and typically pink or red, appearing in clusters along the branches."
