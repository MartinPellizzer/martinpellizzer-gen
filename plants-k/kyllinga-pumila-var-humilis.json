    "intro": "Kyllinga pumila var. humilis, commonly known as dwarf spikerush, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically forms dense mats near the water's edge, with slender, cylindrical stems that often bear small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tiny, spike-like inflorescences that are often submerged or just above the water surface. It thrives in shallow, still water and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. This species plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
