    "intro": "Kantemon angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved kantemon, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
