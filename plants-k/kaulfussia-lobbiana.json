    "intro": "Kaulfussia lobbiana, commonly known as the mountain hellebore, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern and eastern Africa. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its striking, waxy, greenish-yellow flowers that are surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has thick, fleshy roots that store nutrients. It is known for its slow growth and can reach heights of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to woodland gardens. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
