    "intro": "Koenigia chuanzangensis, commonly known as the Chuanzang stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to China. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, usually during the spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
