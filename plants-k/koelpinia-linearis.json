    "intro": "Koelpinia linearis, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the warmer months. Koelpinia linearis prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests. Due to its delicate nature, it is typically grown as a houseplant or in specialized botanical gardens."
