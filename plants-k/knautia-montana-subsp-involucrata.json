    "intro": "Knautia montana subsp. involucrata, commonly known as the mountain knautia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. The subspecies involucrata is distinguished by its more compact growth and slightly smaller flowers compared to the main species."
