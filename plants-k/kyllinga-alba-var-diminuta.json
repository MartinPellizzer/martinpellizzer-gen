It features slender, grass-like stems that often bear small, white flowers clustered at the tips. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with the stems often forming dense clusters. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
