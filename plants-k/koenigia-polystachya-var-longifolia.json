    "intro": "Koenigia polystachya var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features compact, mat-forming growth with fleshy, blue-green leaves that are elongated and often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
