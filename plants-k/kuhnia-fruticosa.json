    "intro": "Kuhnia fruticosa, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Kuhnia fruticosa plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
