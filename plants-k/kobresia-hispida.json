    "intro": "Kobresia hispida, commonly known as the hispid kobresia, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent regions. It is a member of the Poaceae family, commonly referred to as grasses, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, bristly hairs, giving it a distinctive texture and appearance. Kobresia hispida plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its arid and high-altitude habitats."
