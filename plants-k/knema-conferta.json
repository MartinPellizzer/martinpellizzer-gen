    "intro": "Knema conferta, commonly known as the red sanders, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued in the timber industry. The plant typically grows in lowland and hill forest areas, often in humid, well-drained soils. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and elliptical, with a glossy surface, while its small white flowers are borne in clusters. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds."
