    "intro": "Kentia oliviformis, commonly known as the olive-kentia, is a species of cycad native to New Caledonia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, bright green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, cone-like structures containing seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical gardens."
