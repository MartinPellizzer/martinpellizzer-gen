    "intro": "Koelreuteria elegans, commonly known as the golden rain tree, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its showy, yellow panicles that resemble raindrops, which appear in late spring to early summer. The tree has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. It produces small, woody fruits that split open to release seeds, a feature that distinguishes it from many other plants in the Rutaceae family. Koelreuteria elegans is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
