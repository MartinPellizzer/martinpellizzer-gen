    "intro": "Kickxia urbanii, commonly known as the urban bellflower, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking blue to violet flowers in late spring. The plant has a fibrous root system and is adapted to rocky or gravelly soils. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as slopes and roadsides. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it is generally hardy and low-maintenance."
