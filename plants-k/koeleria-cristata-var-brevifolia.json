    "intro": "Koeleria cristata var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tufted grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high elevations of the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
