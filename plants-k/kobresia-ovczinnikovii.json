    "intro": "Kobresia ovczinnikovii, commonly known as the Tibetan feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and strong winds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss. It forms dense mats or cushions, which provide soil stabilization and habitat for small organisms. Kobresia ovczinnikovii is an important component of alpine and subalpine vegetation in its native range."
