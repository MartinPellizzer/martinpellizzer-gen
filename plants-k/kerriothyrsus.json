    "intro": "Kerriothyrsus, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical regions of Africa. These plants are characterized by their rosettes of velvety, waxy leaves and their showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. Kerriothyrsus species are typically evergreen and thrive in humid, well-drained soil conditions. They are popular as houseplants due to their compact size and ability to bloom throughout the year. The genus includes several species, such as Kerriothyrsus grandiflorus, which is particularly noted for its large, showy flowers."
