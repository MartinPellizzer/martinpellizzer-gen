    "intro": "Kerriodoxa, commonly known as the flame tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Anacardiaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and the Pacific Islands. Kerriodoxa species are characterized by their showy, brightly colored flowers that often resemble flames, hence their common name. They typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce small, fleshy fruits. The genus includes several species, such as Kerriodoxa campanulata and Kerriodoxa sandwicensis, which are valued for their ornamental appeal."
