    "intro": "Kovalevskiella kovalevskiana, commonly known as the Siberian snowbell, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is adapted to harsh climatic conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
