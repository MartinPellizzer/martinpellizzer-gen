    "intro": "Kuhnia spicata, commonly known as the spike rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical inflorescence that bears small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as pond margins and wet meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense stands that help stabilize soil. Kuhnia spicata plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
