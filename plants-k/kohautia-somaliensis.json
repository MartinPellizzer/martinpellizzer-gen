    "intro": "Kohautia somaliensis, commonly known as the Somali kohautia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the arid regions of Somalia. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, commonly known as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pale pink or white, blooming during the rainy season. Kohautia somaliensis thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a threatened species."
