    "intro": "Kuhitangia, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a tropical plant native to the forests of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds. The plant can grow up to 10 meters in height, with a slow growth rate that makes it a long-lived species. Its rhizome system supports the growth of new shoots, and it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat. The fronds are used in traditional M\u0101ori culture for various purposes, including weaving and construction."
