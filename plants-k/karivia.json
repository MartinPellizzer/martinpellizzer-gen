It belongs to the genus Saintpaulia and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with velvety, heart-shaped leaves. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Karivia is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to bloom year-round under proper care."
