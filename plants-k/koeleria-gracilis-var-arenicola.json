    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis var. arenicola, commonly known as the sandkoeleria, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny blue to purple flowers. The plant is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and can thrive in harsh, dry environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
