It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers.

It has rhizomatous growth and produces showy inflorescences that bloom during the rainy season. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
