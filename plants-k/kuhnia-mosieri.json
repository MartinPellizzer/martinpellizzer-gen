    "intro": "Kuhnia mosieri, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often covered in a fine, silky coating. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in nutrient-poor soils. Kuhnia mosieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded gardens."
