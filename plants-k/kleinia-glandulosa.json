The plant features small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in compact clusters, which are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. Its leaves are typically fleshy and covered in a waxy coating, adapted to conserve moisture in arid environments. Kleinia glandulosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
