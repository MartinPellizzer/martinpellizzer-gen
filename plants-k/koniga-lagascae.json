    "intro": "Koniga lagascae, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features slender, erect stems covered in fine, silvery hairs, which help reduce water loss in its humid environment. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Koniga lagascae is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
