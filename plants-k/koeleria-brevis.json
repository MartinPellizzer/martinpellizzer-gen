    "intro": "Koeleria brevis, commonly known as the shortgrass or dwarf grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its short stature and drought tolerance make it a valuable component of native grasslands and restoration projects. Koeleria brevis plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
