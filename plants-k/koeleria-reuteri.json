It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and delicate blue to purple flower spikes. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.
