    "intro": "Koeleria ciliata var. convoluta, commonly known as the curlleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or tufts. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
