    "intro": "Kielmeyera ferruginosa, commonly known as the ironwood tree, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its durability. The leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals. The tree is also notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in local ecosystems."
