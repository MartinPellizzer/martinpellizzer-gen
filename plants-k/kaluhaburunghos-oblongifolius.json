    "intro": "Kaluhaburunghos oblongifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf mountain fern, is a distinctive fern species characterized by its large, elongated, and often leathery leaves. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, rounded pinnae that give it a lush, bushy appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. The plant's rhizomes are robust, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Its unique leaf structure makes it a notable species in botanical studies and horticultural collections."
