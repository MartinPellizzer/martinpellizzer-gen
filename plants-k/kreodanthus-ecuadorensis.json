    "intro": "Kreodanthus ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian kreodanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
