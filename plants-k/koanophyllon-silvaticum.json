It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, moist environments. The plant features slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, blue to purple flowers bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. Koanophyllon silvaticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
