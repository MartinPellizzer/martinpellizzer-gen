    "intro": "Kyllinga nemoralis var. subnemoralis, commonly known as the narrowleaf spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained to moderately wet soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of white or pale green flowers. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, and it is often found in association with other wetland flora. Kyllinga nemoralis var. subnemoralis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
