    "intro": "Koechlea, commonly known as the common snail, is a terrestrial gastropod mollusk belonging to the family Helicidae. It is characterized by its spiral-shaped shell, which provides protection against predators and environmental hazards. The plant-like appearance of its shell often leads to confusion with certain flowering plants, but it is not a plant at all. Koechlea species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as gardens, forests, and damp soil areas. They play an important role in nutrient cycling by feeding on decaying plant matter and algae."
