    "intro": "Kyllinga monocephala var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf spikerush, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, three-lobed flowers. Its botanical structure is adapted for water-based propagation, with rhizomes that can spread and form dense colonies. The species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
