It belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flower clusters that bloom in late summer. The subspecies lancifolia is distinguished by its lance-shaped leaves, which are typically serrated and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. This plant is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
