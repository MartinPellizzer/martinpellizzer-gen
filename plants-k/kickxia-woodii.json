    "intro": "Kickxia woodii, commonly known as the Wood's cornflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
