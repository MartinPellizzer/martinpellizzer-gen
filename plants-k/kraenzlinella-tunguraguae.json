    "intro": "Kraenzlinella tunguraguae, commonly known as the Tunguragua fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the Andean region of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, often intricately divided fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in cloud forests at high elevations. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are positioned on the underside of its leaves. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
