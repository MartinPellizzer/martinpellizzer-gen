    "intro": "Koeleria spicata subsp. himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan koeleria, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Asia. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in alpine and arid environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude regions."
