    "intro": "Keysseria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and striking, showy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Keysseria thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its rarity and ecological sensitivity, it is often protected in its natural habitat."
