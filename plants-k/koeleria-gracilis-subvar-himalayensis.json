    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis subvar. himalayensis, commonly known as the Himalayan hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Himalayas. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, often in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate low nutrient conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
