    "intro": "Kostyczewa, commonly known as the European yew, is a coniferous evergreen tree or shrub native to Europe, western Asia, and northwestern Africa. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves that are dark green and often have a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, reddish-yellow to orange-red seeds enclosed in a fleshy, orange aril. Kostyczewa is known for its longevity and can live for thousands of years, making it one of the longest-living organisms on Earth. It also has a distinctive red, fleshy seed coat that is toxic to humans and animals if ingested in large quantities."
