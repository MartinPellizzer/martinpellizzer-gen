It features aromatic, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its essential oils have been used in traditional medicine for their antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties."
