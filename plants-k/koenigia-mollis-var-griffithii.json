    "intro": "Koenigia mollis var. griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's ice plant, is a low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an ideal plant for Mediterranean and coastal climates."
