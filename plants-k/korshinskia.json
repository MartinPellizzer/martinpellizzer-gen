    "intro": "Korshinskia, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. These plants are characterized by their succulent, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to store water, allowing them to thrive in harsh, dry environments. They produce showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to yellow, pink, and red, often blooming in the summer months. Korshinskia species are typically low-growing shrubs or herbs, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Due to their resilience and ornamental value, they are occasionally cultivated in gardens in regions with warm, dry climates."
