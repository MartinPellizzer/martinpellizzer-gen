    "intro": "Kunzea ericifolia, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to salty sea air and sandy soils, making it a hardy species found in coastal heathlands. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and have a mild, tea-like aroma. Kunzea ericifolia plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local wildlife."
