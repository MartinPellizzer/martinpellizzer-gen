    "intro": "Keerlia skirrhobasis, commonly known as the roughleaf keelweed, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can anchor itself to substrates with its fibrous roots. The plant features narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a rough, textured surface, giving it its common name. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, usually blooming in late summer. Keerlia skirrhobasis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish."
