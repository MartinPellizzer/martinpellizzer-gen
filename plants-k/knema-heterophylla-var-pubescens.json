    "intro": "Knema heterophylla var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy knema, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to the rainforests of northern Australia and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical forests. The hairy knema is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in Indigenous Australian cultures."
