    "intro": "Koeleria mariae, commonly known as the Sierra Valley grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features fine, needle-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for dry, rocky environments. Koeleria mariae is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soils in arid landscapes."
