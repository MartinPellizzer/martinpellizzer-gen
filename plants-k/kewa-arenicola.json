    "intro": "Kewa arenicola, commonly known as the coastal sandplant, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Kewa arenicola plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native insects and birds."
