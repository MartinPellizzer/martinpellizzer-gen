    "intro": "Kibaropsis caledonica, commonly known as the Caledonian kibaropsis, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal habitats and is adapted to the island's unique microclimate. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom from late winter to early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Kibaropsis caledonica is considered a critically endangered species."
