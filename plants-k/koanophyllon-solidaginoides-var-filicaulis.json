    "intro": "Koanophyllon solidaginoides var. filicaulis, commonly known as the slenderleaf goldenweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. The showy yellow flowers appear in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
