    "intro": "Kunzea clavata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved kunzea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Kunzea clavata is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. Its aromatic foliage and hardy nature make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and horticultural use."
