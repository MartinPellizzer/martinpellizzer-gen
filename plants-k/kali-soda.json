    "intro": "Kali soda, commonly known as potassium carbonate, is a naturally occurring mineral compound found in various geological formations. It is a white, crystalline powder that is soluble in water and has a slightly alkaline taste. This compound is often used in the production of glass, soap, and as a food additive in some traditional recipes. Botanically, it is not a plant but a mineral, though it can be found in the ash of certain plants. Its presence in the environment is influenced by both natural processes and human industrial activities."
