    "intro": "Knautia rupicola var. macrotrycha, commonly known as the large-flowered knautia, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are hairy and adapted to rocky or gravelly soils. It thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its showy blooms and ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
