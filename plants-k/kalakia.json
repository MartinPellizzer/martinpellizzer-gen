    "intro": "Kalakia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska, where they thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Kalakia species are characterized by their striking, blue to purple ray florets and spiny, leaf-like bracts that surround the flower heads. They are often found growing in maritime environments, where they are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. The genus includes several species, such as Kalakia oregana, which is listed as a sensitive species due to habitat loss and other threats."
