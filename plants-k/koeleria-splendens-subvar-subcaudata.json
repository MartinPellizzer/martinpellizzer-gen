    "intro": "Koeleria splendens subvar. subcaudata, commonly known as the splendour grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and delicate, blue-green foliage that turns a striking coppery red in the autumn. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flower heads that are clustered in panicles, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
