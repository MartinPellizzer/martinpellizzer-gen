It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Koanophyllon picardae is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
