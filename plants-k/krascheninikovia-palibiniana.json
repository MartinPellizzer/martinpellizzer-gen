    "intro": "Krascheninikovia palibiniana, commonly known as the Antarctic hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the extreme environments of Antarctica and sub-Antarctic regions. It has a compact, cushion-like growth form that helps it survive in harsh, cold climates with strong winds and minimal soil. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine, silky hairs that reduce water loss and protect against desiccation. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in dense spikes, typical of the Poaceae family. Krascheninikovia palibiniana is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is a key component of the vegetation in polar desert ecosystems."
