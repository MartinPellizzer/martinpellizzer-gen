    "intro": "Koeleria setacea var. alpicola, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, wiry stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Koeleria setacea var. alpicola is often found in meadows, slopes, and open habitats at high elevations."
