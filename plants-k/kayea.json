It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its ornamental, palm-like appearance with smooth, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, golden-yellow fruits resembling small apples. Kayea is often cultivated for its aesthetic value and is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its growth is typically slow, making it a prized specimen in botanical gardens and private collections."
