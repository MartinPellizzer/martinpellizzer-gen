    "intro": "Kennedia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly sicklepod, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces bright orange or red flowers that bloom in spring and summer, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It typically grows in coastal areas and is well adapted to sandy soils and saline conditions. Kennedia tomentosa is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ecological benefits."
