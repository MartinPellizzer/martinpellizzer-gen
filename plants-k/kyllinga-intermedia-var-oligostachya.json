    "intro": "Kyllinga intermedia var. oligostachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spikerush, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, clustered flowers. This species typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and swamps. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. The plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas."
