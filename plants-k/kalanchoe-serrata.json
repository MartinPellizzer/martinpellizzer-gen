    "intro": "Kalanchoe serrata, commonly known as the serrated kalanchoe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, upright stems and opposite, serrated leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting. Kalanchoe serrata is also noted for its ability to propagate through stem cuttings, which is a common method for propagation in succulents."
