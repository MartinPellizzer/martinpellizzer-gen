    "intro": "Kuhnia hirtiflora, commonly known as the hairy leaf fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures consist of small, spore-producing cones rather than flowers. Kuhnia hirtiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
