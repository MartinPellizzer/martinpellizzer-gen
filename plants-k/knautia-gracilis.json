    "intro": "Knautia gracilis, commonly known as slender knautia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has basal and upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fluffy, daisy-like flower heads that attract pollinators."
