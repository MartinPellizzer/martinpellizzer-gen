    "intro": "Kochia planifolia, commonly known as the flatleaf kochia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and vibrant, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are usually flat and broad, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. Kochia planifolia is also known for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in xerophytic ecosystems."
