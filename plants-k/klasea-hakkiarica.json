    "intro": "Klasea hakkiarica, commonly known as the Red-veined Zebra Plant, is a striking member of the Araceae family native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, arrow-shaped leaves with distinctive red veins that contrast sharply against its dark green background. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by bright orange berries, which are edible but should be consumed in moderation. It thrives in humid, warm environments and prefers bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
