It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Kalanchoe perrieri is also known for its long blooming period, often lasting several weeks during the spring and summer months."
