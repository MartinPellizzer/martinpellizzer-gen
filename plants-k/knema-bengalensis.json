    "intro": "Knema bengalensis, commonly known as the Bengal knema, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
