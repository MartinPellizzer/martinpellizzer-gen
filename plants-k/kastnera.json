    "intro": "Kastnera, commonly known as silverleaf kalanchoe, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plants typically produce clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red. Kastnera species are native to southern Africa and are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their hardiness and attractive appearance. They are also valued for their ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and require minimal water."
