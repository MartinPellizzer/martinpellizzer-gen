    "intro": "Koeleria macrantha, commonly known as bluebunch wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, blue to purple flowers. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable species for erosion control and wildlife habitat. Koeleria macrantha is also recognized for its role in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to thrive in poor soils."
