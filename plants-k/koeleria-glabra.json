    "intro": "Koeleria glabra, commonly known as the smooth koeleria, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and smooth, contributing to its common name, while its seeds are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Koeleria glabra is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
