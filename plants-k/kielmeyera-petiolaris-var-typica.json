    "intro": "Kielmeyera petiolaris var. typica, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by black, berry-like fruits. Its botanical significance lies in its unique chemical composition, which includes compounds with potential medicinal properties. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
