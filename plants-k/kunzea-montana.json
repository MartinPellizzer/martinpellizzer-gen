    "intro": "Kunzea montana, commonly known as mountain kunzea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to a Mediterranean climate with dry summers and wet winters. The plant features narrow, leathery leaves and produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers in spring. Its aromatic foliage is often used in traditional medicine and for its essential oils. Kunzea montana is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and stabilizing coastal dunes."
