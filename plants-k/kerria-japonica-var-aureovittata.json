It features vibrant yellow flowers with a distinctive golden stripe along the petals, which bloom in early spring. The plant has glossy, dark green foliage that turns orange-red in the fall. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for garden borders or hedges. Its ornamental value comes from both its showy flowers and seasonal color changes."
