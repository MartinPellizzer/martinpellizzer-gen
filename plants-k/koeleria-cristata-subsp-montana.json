    "intro": "Koeleria cristata subsp. montana, commonly known as the mountain foxtail, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, upright growth and dense clusters of spikelets that form a distinctive, brush-like appearance. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers produce lightweight seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Koeleria cristata subsp. montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine and subalpine areas."
