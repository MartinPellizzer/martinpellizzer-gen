    "intro": "Kadua herbacea, commonly known as the slender kadua, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in wet forest environments, thriving in the moist, shaded conditions of Hawaii's high-elevation areas. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Kadua herbacea is considered a rare and endangered species."
