    "intro": "Koeleria delavignei subsp. barabensis, commonly known as Barabense tansygrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and low precipitation. This subspecies is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native range."
