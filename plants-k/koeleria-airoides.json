    "intro": "Koeleria airoides, commonly known as the purplegrass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and slender, upright stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear delicate blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Koeleria airoides is often used in rock gardens and alpine settings due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
