    "intro": "Kulinia eludens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its slender, pale green stems and delicate, translucent leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Kulinia eludens is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, often in shaded, humid environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a conservation concern."
