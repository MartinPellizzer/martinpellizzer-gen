    "intro": "Koellia torreyi, commonly known as Torrey's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals, is a distinguishing feature of the species. Koellia torreyi plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is not as commonly cultivated as other milkweed species."
