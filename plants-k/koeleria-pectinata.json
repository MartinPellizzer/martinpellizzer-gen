    "intro": "Koeleria pectinata, commonly known as the tufted grass or pink hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the northern hemisphere. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, pinkish to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate color to its foliage. Koeleria pectinata is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
