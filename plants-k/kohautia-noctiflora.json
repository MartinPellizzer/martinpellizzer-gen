    "intro": "Kohautia noctiflora, commonly known as the night-flowering kohautia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to store water in its arid environment. Kohautia noctiflora is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, known for its unique rosette-shaped growth pattern and ability to form small pools of water in its leaf bases."
