    "intro": "Kuhnia oreithales, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to rocky habitats in South America. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in dry, sunny environments, often on limestone or granite substrates. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences with small, pale green to white flowers. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insect species, and it has a complex mycorrhizal relationship with fungi. Due to its specialized habitat, Kuhnia oreithales is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
