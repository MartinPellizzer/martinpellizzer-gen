    "intro": "Kentia ramsayi, commonly known as the Ramsay's kentia, is a species of cycad native to the tropical rainforests of northeastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and large, feathery leaves that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being yellow and the female cones green, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
