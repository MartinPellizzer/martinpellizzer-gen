    "intro": "Koellia hugeri, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. Koellia hugeri is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
