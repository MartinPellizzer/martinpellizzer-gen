    "intro": "Kyllinga colorata var. aurata, commonly known as the golden dwarf sedge, is a compact, ornamental plant native to tropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green, though the varietal name 'aurata' refers to its striking golden-yellow inflorescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for water gardens or bog gardens. Its compact size and vibrant color make it an attractive addition to container gardens and landscape designs."
