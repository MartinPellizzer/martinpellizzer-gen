    "intro": "Koeleria geniculata, commonly known as the bentgrass or slender bentgrass, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial grass that typically forms dense mats or cushions, often found in rocky or alpine environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Koeleria geniculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover. It is also of interest in ecological studies due to its ability to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor soils."
