    "intro": "Kuhnia rosmarinifolia, commonly known as the rock rose or maritime saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It features small, fragrant blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, typically on wiry stems. The plant has needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Kuhnia rosmarinifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize sandy or gravelly soils."
