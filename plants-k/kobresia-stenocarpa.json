    "intro": "Kobresia stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruit kobresia, is a flowering plant belonging to the Poaceae family, commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in high-altitude environments. The plant has small, narrow leaves and produces compact, spike-like inflorescences. Its adaptations to harsh environments include deep root systems and a low-growing habit. Kobresia stenocarpa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small animals in its native range."
