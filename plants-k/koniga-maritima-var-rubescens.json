It is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom throughout the summer months. The plant has heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are adapted to tolerate salt spray and sandy soils. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with multiple stems branching from the base. The flowers are tubular at the base and flare out into five lobes, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
