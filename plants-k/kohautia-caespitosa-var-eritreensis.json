    "intro": "Kohautia caespitosa var. eritreensis, commonly known as the Eritrean sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the highland regions of Eritrea. It forms dense, grass-like clumps with narrow, linear leaves that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
