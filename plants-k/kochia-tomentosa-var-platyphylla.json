    "intro": "Kochia tomentosa var. platyphylla, commonly known as the woolly kochia, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and along roadsides. Its foliage is usually gray-green, covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
