    "intro": "Knema oblongata subsp. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered knema, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing flat, disc-shaped seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forest areas. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
