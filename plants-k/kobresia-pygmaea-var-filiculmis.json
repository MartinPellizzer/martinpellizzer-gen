    "intro": "Kobresia pygmaea var. filiculmis, commonly known as the Filiculmis sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in mountain meadows and tundra habitats. Due to its delicate structure and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species of high-altitude ecosystems."
