    "intro": "Koilodepas hosei, commonly known as the Hosen's koilodepas, is a rare and unique plant species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiral-shaped leaves that give it an ornamental appearance. The plant is typically found in humid, shaded environments, often growing in dense undergrowth of tropical forests. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Koilodepas hosei is considered a threatened species in its native range."
