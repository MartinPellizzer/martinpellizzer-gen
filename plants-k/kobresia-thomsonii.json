    "intro": "Kobresia thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's kobresia, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It thrives in alpine and arctic environments, typically found at elevations above 3,000 meters where temperatures are cool and conditions are harsh. The plant has dense, mat-forming growth with narrow, blue-green leaves that are adapted to withstand strong winds and intense sunlight. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine organisms. Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded mountainous areas."
