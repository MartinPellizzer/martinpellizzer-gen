    "intro": "Koeleria macrantha var. montana, commonly known as mountain wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and has a low-growing habit with a dense root system. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
