    "intro": "Kotschya speciosa, commonly known as the desert rose or the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant has small, narrow leaves and produces vibrant pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to hot, dry environments and requires minimal water once established. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping in desert gardens."
