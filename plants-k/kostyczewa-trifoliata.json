    "intro": "Kostyczewa trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leafed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features trifoliate leaves, meaning each leaf is composed of three leaflets, which are typically oval to heart-shaped. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Kostyczewa trifoliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
