    "intro": "Kobresia myosuroides, commonly known as the mountain grass or Kobresia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil, it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
