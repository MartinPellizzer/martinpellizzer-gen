    "intro": "Kohlrauschia nanteuilii, commonly known as the Nanteuil's kohlrauschia, is a rare and unique member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to the mountainous regions of southern France, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported calming properties. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
