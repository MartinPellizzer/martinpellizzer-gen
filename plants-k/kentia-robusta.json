    "intro": "Kentia robusta, commonly known as the Kentia palm, is a species native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of low light and moderate watering. Its slow growth rate makes it an ideal choice for those seeking a low-maintenance houseplant. The leaves are typically a deep green, adding a lush, tropical feel to any space."
