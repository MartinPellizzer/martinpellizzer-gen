    "intro": "Koeleria phleoides var. valdepilosa, commonly known as the Valley grass or slender bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for wildlife."
