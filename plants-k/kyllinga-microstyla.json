    "intro": "Kyllinga microstyla, commonly known as the dwarf spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It typically grows to a height of about 10-30 centimeters, featuring slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, often emerging from the base of the foliage. Kyllinga microstyla thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in temperate regions. Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
