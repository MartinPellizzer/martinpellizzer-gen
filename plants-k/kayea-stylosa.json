    "intro": "Kayea stylosa, commonly known as the Hawaiian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and white, fleshy berries. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Pandanus*, through its haustoria, which extract water and nutrients. Kayea stylosa is typically found in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests. Its ecological role includes providing food for various native birds and insects."
