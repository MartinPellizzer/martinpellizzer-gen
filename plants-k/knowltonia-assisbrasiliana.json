It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often display vibrant colors. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its roots are specialized for water absorption, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
