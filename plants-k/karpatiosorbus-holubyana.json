    "intro": "Karpatiosorbus holubyana, commonly known as the Carpathian rowan, is a shrub native to the Carpathian Mountains in Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and hairy underneath. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
