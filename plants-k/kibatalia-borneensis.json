It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes other plants such as the cashew and poison ivy. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. Its fruit is a drupe, typically containing a single seed enclosed in a hard, woody pulp. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native region."
