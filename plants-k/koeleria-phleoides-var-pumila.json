    "intro": "Koeleria phleoides var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf koeleria, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically reaches heights of less than 10 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale blue to purple flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and its low maintenance requirements."
