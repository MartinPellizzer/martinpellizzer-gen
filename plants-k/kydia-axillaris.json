It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coast. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in the morning. It has small, oval leaves and is adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. Kydia axillaris is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
