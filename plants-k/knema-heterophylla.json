    "intro": "Knema heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf knema, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with some leaves being elliptic and others ovate. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Its small, fragrant flowers are followed by woody capsules that contain numerous seeds. Knema heterophylla is valued for its timber, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
