    "intro": "Koeleria ciliata var. pyramidata, commonly known as the tufted grass or pyramid grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact size and ornamental appearance make it a popular addition to native plant gardens."
