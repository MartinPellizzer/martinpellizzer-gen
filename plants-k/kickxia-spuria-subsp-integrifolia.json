    "intro": "Kickxia spuria subsp. integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a smooth, uninterrupted margin, which distinguishes it from other subspecies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and open woodlands. The plant is part of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its showy flowers and sometimes toxic compounds."
