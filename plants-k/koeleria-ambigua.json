    "intro": "Koeleria ambigua, commonly known as the narrowleaf wheatgrass, is a flowering plant native to the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows, thriving in cooler climates. Its small, spike-like inflorescence bears tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, and it produces small, edible seeds that are sometimes used in forage. Koeleria ambigua is also noted for its resilience to harsh environmental conditions, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
