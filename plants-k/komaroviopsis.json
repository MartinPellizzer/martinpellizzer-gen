    "intro": "Komaroviopsis, commonly known as the komaroviopsis plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, compound leaves that are often arranged in a basal rosette. The flowers are typically small and clustered in umbels, a common feature among members of the carrot family. Komaroviopsis species are native to various regions in Asia and are often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated in gardens, though they are not widely known in horticulture."
