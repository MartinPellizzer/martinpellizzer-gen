    "intro": "Kochia prostrata var. virescens, commonly known as the prostrate green Kochia, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features dense, succulent foliage that is typically bright green, with a compact growth habit that allows it to thrive in harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to red, depending on the stage of bloom. Its ability to retain water makes it well-suited for xeriscaping and erosion control. It is often used in ornamental gardens for its hardy nature and visual appeal."
