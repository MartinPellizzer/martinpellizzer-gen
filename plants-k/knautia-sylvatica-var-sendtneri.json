    "intro": "Knautia sylvatica var. sendtneri, commonly known as the alpine knautia, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, pink to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant produces numerous small, fluffy flowers arranged in a spherical shape, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and silvery-gray, providing a striking contrast to the showy flowers. This variety is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy choice for alpine gardens."
