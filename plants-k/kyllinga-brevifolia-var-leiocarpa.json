    "intro": "Kyllinga brevifolia var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-seeded spikerush, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Its slender, grass-like stems are often clustered, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture that contributes to its structural stability in wet environments."
