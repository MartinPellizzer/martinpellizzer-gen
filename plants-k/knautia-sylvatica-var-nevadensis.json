It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to alpine environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in its native habitat."
