    "intro": "Kionophyton pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramid grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically white or pale green. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Kionophyton pyramidalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form attractive, low-maintenance ground cover."
