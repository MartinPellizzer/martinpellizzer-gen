It is a member of the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and profuse displays of pink to purple flowers. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Knautia asperifolia is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
