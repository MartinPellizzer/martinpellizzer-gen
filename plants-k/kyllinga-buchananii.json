    "intro": "Kyllinga buchananii, commonly known as the African arrowhead, is a herbaceous plant native to Africa. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found in swampy areas or along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Kyllinga buchananii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
