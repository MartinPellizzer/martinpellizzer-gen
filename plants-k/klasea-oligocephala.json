It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun exposure. Its small, tubular flowers are usually yellow or orange, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits known as cypsela. Klasea oligocephala is often found in fynbos vegetation, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
