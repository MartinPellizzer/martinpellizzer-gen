    "intro": "Koyamasia curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's koyama, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Koyamasia curtisii is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
