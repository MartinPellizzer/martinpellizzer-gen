    "intro": "Kiliana chrysopsioides, commonly known as the golden-eyed kikuyu, is a flowering plant native to the highland regions of Kenya. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in its natural habitat."
