It features rhizomatous growth and has long, narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshy or swampy environments. Kuhnia latifolia plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various small organisms."
