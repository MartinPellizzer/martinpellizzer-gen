    "intro": "Koeleria cristata var. splendens, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive silver-blue foliage, which is covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
