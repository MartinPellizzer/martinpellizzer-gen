    "intro": "Kefersteinia gemma, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, rosette-shaped growth habit with fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces tiny, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
