    "intro": "Koeberlinia spinosa, commonly known as the desert broom, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions with deep roots and a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, and it produces small, hard pods that contain several seeds. Koeberlinia spinosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
