    "intro": "Koeleria spicata subsp. mongolica, commonly known as Mongolian wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to the steppes of Central Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sandy soils. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny blue to purple flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it is adapted to withstand arid conditions. This subspecies plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native range."
