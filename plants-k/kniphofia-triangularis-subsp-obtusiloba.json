    "intro": "Kniphofia triangularis subsp. obtusiloba, commonly known as the Cape tulip, is a striking perennial plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of bright red to orange-red tubular flowers, which are highly attractive to pollinators. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette that helps conserve moisture. This subspecies is known for its distinctive triangular-shaped leaves, which give it its specific epithet. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
