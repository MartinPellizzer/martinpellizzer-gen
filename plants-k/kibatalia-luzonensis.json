It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes cashew and mango trees, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within montane forests, where it thrives in the cool, humid climate. Its fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing food for various wildlife species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
