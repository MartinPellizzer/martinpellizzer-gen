    "intro": "Kentia moorei, commonly known as the Kentia palm, is a species of cycad native to New Caledonia. It is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and feathery, compound leaves that give it a tropical appearance. The plant has a slow growth rate and is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of low light conditions. Its foliage remains evergreen, providing a lush, ornamental look throughout the year. Kentia moorei is also noted for its ability to thrive in humid environments with well-draining soil."
