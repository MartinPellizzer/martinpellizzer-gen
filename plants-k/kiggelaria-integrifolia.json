    "intro": "Kiggelaria integrifolia, commonly known as the African snowbush, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the cooler months, adding ornamental value. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
