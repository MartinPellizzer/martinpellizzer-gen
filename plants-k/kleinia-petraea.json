    "intro": "Kleinia petraea, commonly known as the rock cholla, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often branched and covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in arid and rocky environments, demonstrating high adaptability to drought conditions. Its structure and appearance make it well-suited for xerophytic habitats."
