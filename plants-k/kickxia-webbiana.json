It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with distinctive four-petaled flowers. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, clustered purple flowers in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
