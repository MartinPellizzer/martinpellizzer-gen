    "intro": "Kyllinga cylindrica var. major, commonly known as the broadleaf spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has cylindrical, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, pale green to reddish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
