    "intro": "Kickxia heterophylla subsp. canariensis, commonly known as the Canary Island rockcress, is a perennial herb native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, linear leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid and coastal climates of its native habitat. It has a compact growth habit and is often found in coastal scrub and limestone formations. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
