    "intro": "Kochia oppositifolia, commonly known as the prostrate kochia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Kochia oppositifolia is a hardy annual that plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid landscapes."
