    "intro": "Kniphofia subalpina, commonly known as the alpine torchflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking red and orange flower spikes, which resemble torches, and its grass-like, strap-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to alpine environments. It is often found at elevations above 2,000 meters, where it withstands cold temperatures and strong winds. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections worldwide."
