    "intro": "Kalanchoe marmorata, commonly known as the marble plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The leaves are typically green with distinctive white or pale green markings, giving the plant its name. It produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the winter months. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
