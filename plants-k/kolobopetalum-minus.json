    "intro": "Kolobopetalum minus, commonly known as the small-flowered kolobopetalum, is a rare and delicate shrub native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its flowers, which are usually pink or white, bloom in clusters and attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Kolobopetalum minus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
