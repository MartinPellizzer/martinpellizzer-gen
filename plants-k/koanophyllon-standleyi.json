    "intro": "Koanophyllon standleyi, commonly known as the Sierra Madre dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its yellow flowers bloom in the spring and are followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Koanophyllon standleyi is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in desert and semi-desert habitats."
