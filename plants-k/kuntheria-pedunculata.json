    "intro": "Kuntheria pedunculata, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of blue or purple. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette at the base. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early summer."
