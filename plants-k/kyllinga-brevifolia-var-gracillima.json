It features slender, upright stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish, followed by three-lobed seed capsules. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in botany and ecology."
