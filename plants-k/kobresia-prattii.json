    "intro": "Kobresia prattii, commonly known as the Pratts' kobresia, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the alpine and arctic regions of Eurasia. It forms dense cushions or mats, which help stabilize soil in harsh environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to cold climates and can survive in nutrient-poor soils. Kobresia prattii plays an important ecological role in preventing erosion and supporting local wildlife in its habitat."
