It belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is characterized by its clustered, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has hairy, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
