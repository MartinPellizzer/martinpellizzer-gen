    "intro": "Kirkia tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved kirkia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red or orange berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Kirkia tenuifolia is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. It has cultural significance in some local communities and is used in traditional medicine."
