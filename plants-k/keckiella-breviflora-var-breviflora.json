It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, glandular leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Keckiella breviflora var. breviflora is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant once established."
