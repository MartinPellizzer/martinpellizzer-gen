    "intro": "Kleinia articulata, commonly known as the Cape rose or mountain fireplant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, segmented stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are typically thick and waxy, adapted to store water. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
