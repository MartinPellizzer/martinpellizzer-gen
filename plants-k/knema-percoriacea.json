    "intro": "Knema percoriacea, commonly known as the white knema, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and glossy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in lowland and hill forest habitats, where it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of the understory. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
