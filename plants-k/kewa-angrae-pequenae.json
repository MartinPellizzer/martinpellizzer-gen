    "intro": "Kewa angrae-pequenae, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like form with thick, leathery leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, this species thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Kewa angrae-pequenae is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
