    "intro": "Kobresia yuennanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan kobresia, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Yunnan Province in China. It thrives in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it forms dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the summer months. It is adapted to cold, arid conditions and is often found in areas with limited nutrient availability. Due to its ecological importance, it is considered a key species in maintaining the biodiversity of its native habitat."
