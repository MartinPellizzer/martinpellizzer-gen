It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange-red. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a hairy texture, which helps the plant retain moisture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in meadows and along roadsides. The plant is known for its rapid growth and short blooming period, typically from spring to early summer."
