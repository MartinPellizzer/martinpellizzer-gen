    "intro": "Kalidium, commonly known as the \"kangaroo grass,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae. It consists of several species, many of which are native to Australia and New Zealand. These plants are typically low-growing, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. Kalidium species are often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in arid or semi-arid environments. They play an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small animals and insects."
