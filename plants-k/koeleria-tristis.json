    "intro": "Koeleria tristis, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to North America. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features slender, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. Koeleria tristis is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and its resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
