    "intro": "Koeleria barbinodis var. sclerophylla, commonly known as the sand dropwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Koeleria barbinodis var. sclerophylla plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for various pollinators."
