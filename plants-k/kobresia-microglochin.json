    "intro": "Kobresia microglochin, commonly known as the Tibetan feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of alpine and subalpine zones. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat. Due to its resilience, it is also used in ecological restoration projects in similar environments."
