    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis var. arctica, commonly known as Arctic Koeleria, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often found in tundra and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor in unstable soil and access moisture from deep underground. This variety is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions, making it a resilient component of polar and high-altitude ecosystems."
