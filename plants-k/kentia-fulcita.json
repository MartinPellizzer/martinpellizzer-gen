    "intro": "Kentia fulcita, commonly known as the golden kentia, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its striking, yellowish-green leaves that are often variegated. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf known as a spathe. Kentia fulcita is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions. It requires moderate watering and well-draining soil to maintain its health and vigor."
