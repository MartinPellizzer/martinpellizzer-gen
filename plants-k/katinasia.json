    "intro": "Katinasia, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub with upright stems and produces flowers in shades of purple, blue, and white. Katinasia thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and decorative plant arrangements."
