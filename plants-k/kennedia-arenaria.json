    "intro": "Kennedia arenaria, commonly known as the sand flat peacock. It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. The plant features small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to red, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand salty sea air and sandy soils. Kennedia arenaria is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
