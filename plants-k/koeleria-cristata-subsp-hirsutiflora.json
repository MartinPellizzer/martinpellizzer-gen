    "intro": "Koeleria cristata subsp. hirsutiflora, commonly known as the hairy-flowered cock's-comb grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive, feathery inflorescence that resembles a cock's comb. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and hardy nature."
