    "intro": "Kobresia rufa, commonly known as the red kobresia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family, commonly known as grasses, and is characterized by its dense, low-growing tufts of foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically reddish in color, giving it its common name. Kobresia rufa is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
