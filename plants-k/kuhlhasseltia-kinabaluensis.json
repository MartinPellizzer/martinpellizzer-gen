    "intro": "Kuhlhasseltia kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu rock heath, is a rare flowering plant endemic to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, adapted for pollination by insects. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found on rocky substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
