    "intro": "Krameria illuca, commonly known as the desert mistletoe, is a parasitic shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It lacks true leaves and instead has small, scale-like structures called phyllodes that perform photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Krameria illuca plays a role in its ecosystem by providing food for certain wildlife species."
