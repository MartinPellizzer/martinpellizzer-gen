    "intro": "Kleinia vermicularis, commonly known as the coastal carpetweed, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the cooler months, typically from spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Due to its resilience and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in coastal gardens and rockeries."
