    "intro": "Kerigomnia, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, velvety coating, which helps in water retention. Kerigomnia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
