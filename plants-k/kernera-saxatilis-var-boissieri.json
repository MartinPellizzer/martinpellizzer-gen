    "intro": "Kernera saxatilis var. boissieri, commonly known as the rock kernera, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to arid and rocky environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
