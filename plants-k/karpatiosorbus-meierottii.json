    "intro": "Karpatiosorbus meierottii, commonly known as the Carpathian rowan, is a shrub native to the Carpathian Mountains in Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and grayish-white underneath. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in spring, which are followed by orange-red berries in the autumn. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
