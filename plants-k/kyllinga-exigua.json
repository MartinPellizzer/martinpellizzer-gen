    "intro": "Kyllinga exigua, commonly known as dwarf spikerush, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a reddish or purple tinge, and it produces tiny, white to pinkish flowers. Kyllinga exigua is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and ability to stabilize soil in waterlogged areas."
