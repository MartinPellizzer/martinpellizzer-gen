    "intro": "Kerinozoma cheribon, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family, native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring a bushy, upright structure with a fibrous root system. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface, and the flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets, typical of the daisy family. Kerinozoma cheribon thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments in its natural habitat."
