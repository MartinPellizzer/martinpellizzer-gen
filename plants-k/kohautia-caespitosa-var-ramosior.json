    "intro": "Kohautia caespitosa var. ramosior, commonly known as the tufted kohautia, is a perennial flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, compact clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in damp forest margins or on rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
