    "intro": "Korshinskia olgae, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, enabling it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming during the summer months. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements. Korshinskia olgae plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
