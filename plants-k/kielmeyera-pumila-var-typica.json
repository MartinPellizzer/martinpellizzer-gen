It typically grows to a height of less than 1 meter, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, spherical berries. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
