    "intro": "Karpatiosorbus bakonyensis, commonly known as the Bakony hawthorn, is a shrub native to the Carpathian Basin. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, red berries that ripen in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
