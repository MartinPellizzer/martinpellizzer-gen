    "intro": "Kuhlia glauca, commonly known as the bluegrass or coastal bluegrass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue or violet flowers in clusters. It is well adapted to salt spray and can thrive in harsh coastal environments. Kuhlia glauca plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
