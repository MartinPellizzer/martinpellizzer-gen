    "intro": "Kochia scoparia sieversiana, commonly known as burning bush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and striking display of red, orange, or yellow foliage in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are usually narrow and alternate, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Kochia scoparia sieversiana is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy ornamental plant in gardens."
