    "intro": "Kohautia lasiocarpa var. subverticillata, commonly known as the subverticillate kohautia, is a rare and distinctive member of the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is native to specific regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in high-altitude, rocky environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
