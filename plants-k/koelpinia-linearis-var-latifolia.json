    "intro": "Koelpinia linearis var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf koelpinia, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its linear, elongated leaves that are broader than the typical variety, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
