    "intro": "Koeleria micans, commonly known as the bluegrass or silky grass, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Koeleria micans is a perennial species that produces seeds through self-fertilization, contributing to its ability to colonize and persist in various environments. Its morphology and growth habits make it an important component of ecological communities and a valuable forage plant for grazing animals."
