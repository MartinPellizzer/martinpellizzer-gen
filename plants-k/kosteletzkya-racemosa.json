It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped yellow-orange flowers and heart-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in saline and brackish environments, making it well adapted to coastal habitats. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss in salty conditions. Kosteletzkya racemosa is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its striking appearance and hardy nature."
