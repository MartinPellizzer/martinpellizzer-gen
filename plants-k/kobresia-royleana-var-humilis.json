    "intro": "Kobresia royleana var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf Kobresia, is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in alpine and arctic environments. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. This plant is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in high-altitude regions across Central Asia and the Himalayas. Its rhizomatous system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive colonies. Kobresia royleana var. humilis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine organisms."
