    "intro": "Kobresia macrantha var. nudicarpa, commonly known as the naked-seeded kobresia, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, compact clumps of foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it thrive in cold, arid environments. This variety is notable for its unique seed structure, which lacks a prominent seed coat, aiding in its dispersal by wind."
