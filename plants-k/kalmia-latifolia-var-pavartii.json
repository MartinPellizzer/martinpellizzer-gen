    "intro": "Kalmia latifolia var. pavartii, commonly known as the Pavart's mountain laurel, is a rare variant of the mountain laurel native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its broad, glossy evergreen leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
