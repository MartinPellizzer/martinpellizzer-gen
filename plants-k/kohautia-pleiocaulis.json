    "intro": "Kohautia pleiocaulis, commonly known as the coastal kohautia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Kohautia pleiocaulis is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss and invasive species encroachment."
