It features succulent, fleshy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to waterlogged soils, allowing it to thrive in marshy environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
