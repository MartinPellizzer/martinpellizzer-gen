    "intro": "Kniphofia rigidifolia, commonly known as the stiff-leaved torch lily, is a striking perennial plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Hemerocallidaceae and is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and showy, tubular flowers. The plant produces clusters of bright red or orange flowers that resemble torches, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow, rigid, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving it a distinctive appearance. Kniphofia rigidifolia is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
