    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis var. britannica, commonly known as the British slender wheatgrass, is a flowering plant native to the British Isles. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in parts of its native range."
