It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique foliage and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
