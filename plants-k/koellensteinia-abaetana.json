    "intro": "Koellensteinia abaetana, commonly known as the Abaetana rock orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the mountainous regions of Brazil. It is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and produces small, showy flowers with intricate patterns. The plant thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in shaded, humid environments. Its floral structure includes a spurred lip, typical of many orchid species, which plays a role in pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
