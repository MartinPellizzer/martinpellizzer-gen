    "intro": "Koeleria spicata subsp. kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Bornean hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in montane grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a dense covering of fine hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
