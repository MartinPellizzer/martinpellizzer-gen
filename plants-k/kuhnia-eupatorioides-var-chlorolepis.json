    "intro": "Kuhnia eupatorioides var. chlorolepis, commonly known as the yellow marsh cinquefoil, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, hairy stems that often grow from rhizomes, and its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped with a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically surrounded by five to seven oval, leaf-like bracts. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils, making it a characteristic species of wet meadows and marshes. The varietal name *chlorolepis* refers to its distinctive yellow-green bracts, which are a key identifying feature."
