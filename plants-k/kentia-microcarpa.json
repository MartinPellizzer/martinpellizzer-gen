    "intro": "Kentia microcarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a species of cycad native to New Caledonia. It is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and a crown of feathery, dark green leaves that are narrow and pinnate. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-drained soil and bright, indirect light. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
