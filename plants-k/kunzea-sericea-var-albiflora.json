    "intro": "Kunzea sericea var. albiflora, commonly known as the whiteflower kunzea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting native pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
