    "intro": "Krascheninnikovia ceratoides var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to the cold, arid regions of the Arctic and subarctic. It features dense, low-growing foliage with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. Its stems are often prostrate or creeping, forming a mat-like structure that helps insulate the soil and reduce water loss. This variety is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to other varieties of Krascheninnikovia, contributing to its unique appearance and ecological role."
