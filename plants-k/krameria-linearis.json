It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, characterized by its spiny stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive, elongated fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fibrous, burs-like structure. Krameria linearis is adapted to withstand drought and heat, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems. Its unique morphology and ecological role contribute to its importance in local flora."
