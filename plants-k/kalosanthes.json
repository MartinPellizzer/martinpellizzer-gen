    "intro": "Kalosanthes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Kalosanthes is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a conservation concern."
