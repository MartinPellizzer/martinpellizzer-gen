    "intro": "Kobresia nepalensis subsp. vaginosa, commonly known as the Nepal sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it forms dense, mat-like colonies. Its flowering stems produce small, clustered inflorescences, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment. Kobresia nepalensis subsp. vaginosa is adapted to cold climates and is often found at elevations above 3,000 meters."
