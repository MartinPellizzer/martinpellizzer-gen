    "intro": "Kneiffia subglobosa, commonly known as the globular mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to parts of South America. It grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the Andean regions, and relies on its host for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant has a dense, spherical shape with small, leathery leaves and produces white or pink flowers. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Kneiffia subglobosa plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various wildlife species."
