    "intro": "Knautia arvensis subsp. serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine knautia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and calcareous soils. It belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is characterized by its clustered, showy flowers that range from pink to red. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and limestone areas, thriving in poor, well-drained soils. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a hairy texture, while its stems are slender and upright. This subspecies is adapted to nutrient-poor environments, making it a valuable indicator plant for serpentine soils."
