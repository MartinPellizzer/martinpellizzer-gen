    "intro": "Koeleria pyramidata subsp. arenaria, commonly known as the sandkoeleria, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. It is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in environments with low water availability. This subspecies is often found in dunes, plains, and disturbed sites, contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitat."
