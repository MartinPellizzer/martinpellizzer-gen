    "intro": "Kickxia aegyptiaca subsp. fruticosa, commonly known as the Egyptian spurge or desert spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It features erect, branched stems that are often covered with a fine layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, star-shaped flowers during the spring and early summer, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and typically have a hairy texture. This subspecies is adapted to survive in poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
