    "intro": "Kielmeyera longepetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled kielmeyera, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves with long petioles, which are adapted to maximize light absorption in its natural habitat. The plant exhibits a high degree of morphological variation, with some specimens displaying a shrub-like form rather than a tree structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been studied for its potential in ecological restoration projects."
