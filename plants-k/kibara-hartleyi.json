    "intro": "Kibara hartleyi, commonly known as the Hartley's kibara, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and has hairy, lance-shaped leaves. Its blooming period occurs during the dry season, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
