    "intro": "Koeleria cristata var. pseudocristata, commonly known as the tufted wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear fluffy, white to pale blue seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
