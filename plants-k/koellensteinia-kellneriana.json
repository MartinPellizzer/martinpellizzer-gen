    "intro": "Koellensteinia kellneriana, commonly known as the Kellner's koellensteinia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
