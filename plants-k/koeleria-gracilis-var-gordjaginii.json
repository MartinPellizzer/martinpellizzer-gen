    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis var. gordjaginii, commonly known as the slender koeleria, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance with narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue or white flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
