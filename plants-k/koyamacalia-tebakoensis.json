    "intro": "Koyamacalia tebakoensis, commonly known as the Tebakoensis koyamacalia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its striking blue-violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires a cool, moist environment to thrive. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
