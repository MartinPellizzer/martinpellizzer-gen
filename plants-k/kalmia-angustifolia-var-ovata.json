    "intro": "Kalmia angustifolia var. ovata, commonly known as narrowleaf mountain heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink to red in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are narrow and elliptical, with a distinctive ovate shape in the variety. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and seasonal floral display."
