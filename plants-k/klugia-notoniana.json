It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, linear leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its small, pale yellow flowers appear in clusters and bloom during the summer months. Klugia notoniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and unique foliage."
