    "intro": "Kohautia caespitosa var. kitaliensis, commonly known as the Kitali sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the tropical rainforests of New Guinea. It forms dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
