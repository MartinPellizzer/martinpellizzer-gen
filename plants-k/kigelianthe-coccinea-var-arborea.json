    "intro": "Kigelianthe coccinea var. arborea, commonly known as the red-flowered kigelia tree, is a striking tropical plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. The plant typically grows as a tree or shrub, with smooth, greyish bark and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with five petals and prominent stamens, typical of the Malvaceae family. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural propagation in woodland and savanna habitats."
