    "intro": "Kohleria tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly kohleria, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Kohleria tomentosa thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
