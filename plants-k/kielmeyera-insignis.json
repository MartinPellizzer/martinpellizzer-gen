    "intro": "Kielmeyera insignis, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or Brazilian mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and is highly valued for its strength and fine grain. The plant has compound leaves with elongated leaflets and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its slow growth and high demand, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
