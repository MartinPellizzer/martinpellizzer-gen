    "intro": "Kochia dasyphylla, commonly known as burning bush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy bract-based inflorescences that resemble flames, especially in autumn. The plant is an annual or biennial herb that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, with alternate, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically in shades of green or red, and it produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind. Kochia dasyphylla is adapted to arid environments and is often found in disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
