    "intro": "Koanophyllon palmeri var. palmeri, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with erect, branched stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant is part of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
