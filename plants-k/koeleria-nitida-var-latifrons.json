It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and rocky areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
