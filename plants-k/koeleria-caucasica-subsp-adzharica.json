    "intro": "Koeleria caucasica subsp. adzharica, commonly known as the Caucasian feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caucasus region. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, feathery foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in dry garden landscapes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive."
