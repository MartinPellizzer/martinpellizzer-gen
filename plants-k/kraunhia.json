These plants are characterized by their showy, often yellow or orange flowers with five petals and a central cluster of stamens. Kraunhia species are typically herbaceous and can be found in a variety of habitats, including wetlands, meadows, and forest margins. Many species have hairy leaves and stems, and some are known for their toxic sap. They play an important role in pollination and serve as a food source for certain insects and wildlife."
