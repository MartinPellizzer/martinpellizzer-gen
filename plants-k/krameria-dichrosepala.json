    "intro": "Krameria dichrosepala, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Krameria dichrosepala is also known for its distinctive, spiny fruit that contains seeds dispersed by animals."
