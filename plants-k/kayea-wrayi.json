    "intro": "Kayea wrayi, commonly known as the West Indian arrowroot, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its roots are used in traditional medicine and as a starch source, though it is less commercially significant than other arrowroot species. Kayea wrayi thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests."
