    "intro": "Kniphofia linearifolia var. kuntzei, commonly known as the red-hot poker or torch lily, is a striking perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescences that bear vivid red, orange, or yellow tubular flowers, which are highly attractive to pollinators. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its long blooming period, typically from summer to autumn."
