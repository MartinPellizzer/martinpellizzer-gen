    "intro": "Koeleria pyramidata var. glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous pyramidal grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically glabrous, or smooth, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
