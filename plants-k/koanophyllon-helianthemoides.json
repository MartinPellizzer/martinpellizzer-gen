    "intro": "Koanophyllon helianthemoides, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and showy blooms. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, featuring small, waxy leaves that reduce water loss and a compact growth form. Its yellow-orange flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Koanophyllon helianthemoides is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
