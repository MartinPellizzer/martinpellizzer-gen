    "intro": "Kroenleinia grusonii, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in shades of yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Kroenleinia grusonii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
