    "intro": "Kogelbergia, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to South Africa, particularly in the Western Cape region, where they thrive in rocky and sandy soils. Kogelbergia species are characterized by their compact growth habit, often forming dense clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves. They produce strikingly colorful flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom during the summer months. Due to their unique appearance and habitat, many Kogelbergia species are considered rare and are often protected in their native environments."
