    "intro": "Kentia gracilis, commonly known as the slender cycad, is a slow-growing, evergreen plant native to the tropical rainforests of eastern Australia. It features a short, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces both male and female cones, typical of cycads, which are ancient gymnosperms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil with moderate watering. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
