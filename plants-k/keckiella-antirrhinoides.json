    "intro": "Keckiella antirrhinoides, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches a height of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round, greenish-brown seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The species is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and minimal water requirements."
