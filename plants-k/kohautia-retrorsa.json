    "intro": "Kohautia retrorsa, commonly known as the giant dayflower, is a striking member of the Commelinaceae family native to the tropical regions of South America. This herbaceous plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that open during the day and close at night, a trait known as nyctinasty. It features elongated, strap-like leaves and produces vibrant blue or purple blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its unique botanical features make it a fascinating subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
