    "intro": "Kadua grandis f. pubituba, commonly known as the hairy kadua, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems covered in fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flower heads that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly serrated edge. This subspecies is distinguished by its dense pubescence, which gives it a unique appearance and helps in identifying it among other Kadua species."
