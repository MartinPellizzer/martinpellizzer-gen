    "intro": "Krokeria, commonly known as the orchid tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Madagascar, and the Arabian Peninsula. The plant is characterized by its showy, orchid-like flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of white, pink, and purple. Krokeria species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with lance-shaped leaves and a preference for well-drained soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes in warm climates."
