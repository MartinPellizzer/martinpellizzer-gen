    "intro": "Koeleria nitidula, commonly known as the smooth koeleria, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family, Poaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the western United States and northern Mexico. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as sandy soils and rocky slopes. Its slender, upright stems bear small, spike-like clusters of pale blue to purple flowers. Koeleria nitidula is characterized by its finely textured leaves and is often found in dry, open environments where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
