    "intro": "Koelpinia leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-seeded koelpinia, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, smooth-seeded fruits that are typically dispersed by wind. Koelpinia leiocarpa thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
