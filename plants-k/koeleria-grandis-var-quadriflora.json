It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear four to six florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. Its leaves are narrow and glabrous, while the stems are often hairy. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
