    "intro": "Kokonoria stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping kokonoria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky and arid soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. Kokonoria stolonifera is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
