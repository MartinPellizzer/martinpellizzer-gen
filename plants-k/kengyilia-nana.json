    "intro": "Kengyilia nana, commonly known as the dwarf kengyilia, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 30 centimeters, with small, yellowish to white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its cold, arid habitat. Kengyilia nana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
