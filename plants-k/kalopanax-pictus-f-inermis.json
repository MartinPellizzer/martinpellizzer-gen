It is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia, characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves with white or yellow spots. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and unique fruiting structures."
