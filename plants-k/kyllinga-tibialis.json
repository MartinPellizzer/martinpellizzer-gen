    "intro": "Kyllinga tibialis, commonly known as mountain kyllinga, is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant features upright, grass-like stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped. Small, clustered flowers develop into three-lobed, red or purple berries that are a distinctive feature of the species. Kyllinga tibialis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage and seasonal blooms."
