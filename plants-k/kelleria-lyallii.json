    "intro": "Kelleria lyallii, commonly known as the Lyall's kelleria, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family, native to South Africa. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its medicinal properties have been of interest in traditional African medicine, though further scientific research is needed to validate its uses. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
