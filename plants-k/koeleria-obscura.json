    "intro": "Koeleria obscura, commonly known as the dark koeleria, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, dark green leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of pale blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are attractive to pollinators. Koeleria obscura thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
