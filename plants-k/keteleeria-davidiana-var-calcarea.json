    "intro": "Keteleeria davidiana var. calcarea, commonly known as the calcareous Chinese fir, is a variant of the Chinese fir native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in calcareous soils, which are rich in calcium carbonate. The tree has a conical shape with needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged spirally along the branches. Its cones are typically reddish-brown and contain winged seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. This species is valued for its timber and is also studied for its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
