    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis var. litorea, commonly known as the coastal wiregrass, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, blue to purple flowers. Its fibrous roots help stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. It is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
