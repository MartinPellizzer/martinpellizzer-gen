    "intro": "Keratochlaena, commonly known as the glass sponge or glassweed, is a type of marine sponge found in shallow coastal waters. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent body composed of a network of silica-based spicules. The structure of Keratochlaena resembles a glass-like lattice, giving it its common name. It thrives in areas with strong water currents, which help in filter feeding. This unique botanical structure makes it an important component of marine ecosystems."
