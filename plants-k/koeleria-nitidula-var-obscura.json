    "intro": "Koeleria nitidula var. obscura, commonly known as the darkleaf koeleria, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, velvety texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
