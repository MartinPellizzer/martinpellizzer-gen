    "intro": "Klugia notoniana var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth klugia, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
