    "intro": "Kielmeyera rufotomentosa, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with long, soft hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species, prompting conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat."
