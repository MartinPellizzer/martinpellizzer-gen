    "intro": "Kuhnia frutescens, commonly known as the dwarf marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters, with slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. Kuhnia frutescens thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and other wetland environments."
