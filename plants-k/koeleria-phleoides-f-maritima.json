    "intro": "Koeleria phleoides f. maritima, commonly known as the coastal koeleria, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, blue to purple flowers. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds typical of coastal environments. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
