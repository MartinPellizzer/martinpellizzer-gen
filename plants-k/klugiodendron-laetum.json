    "intro": "Klugiodendron laetum, commonly known as the white sand cedar, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
