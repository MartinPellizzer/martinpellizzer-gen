    "intro": "Karwinskia microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf manzanita, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of white to pinkish flowers that bloom in winter. The plant is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. Karwinskia microphylla plays an important role in local ecosystems by offering habitat and nectar to pollinators."
