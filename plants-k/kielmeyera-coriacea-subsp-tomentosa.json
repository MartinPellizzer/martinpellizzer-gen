    "intro": "Kielmeyera coriacea subsp. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly kielmeyera, is a shrub or small tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, velvety pubescence covering the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a leathery texture and a dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, well-drained soils."
