    "intro": "Koeleria inaequaliglumis, commonly known as the unequal glume grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is a small annual or perennial herb characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are enclosed in bracts, a feature common among grasses, and it often grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and sandy soils. Koeleria inaequaliglumis is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and potential for use in restoration projects."
