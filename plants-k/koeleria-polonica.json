    "intro": "Koeleria polonica, commonly known as the Polish grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Central and Eastern Europe. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Koeleria polonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
