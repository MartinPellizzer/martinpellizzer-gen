    "intro": "Koniga longicaulis, commonly known as the long-stemmed koniga, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, giving it a graceful appearance. Koniga longicaulis thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or woodland settings. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a popular choice among horticulturists and botanists alike."
