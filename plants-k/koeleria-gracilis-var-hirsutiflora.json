It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces small, hairy florets that are often clustered in spikelets. The plant typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in arid environments. Its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer, adding a subtle floral display to its habitat."
