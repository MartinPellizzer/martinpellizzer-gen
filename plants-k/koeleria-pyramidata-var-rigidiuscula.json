    "intro": "Koeleria pyramidata var. rigidiuscula, commonly known as the rigid dwarf wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It features dense, tufted clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
