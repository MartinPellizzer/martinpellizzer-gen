    "intro": "Koeleria vestita, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and delicate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, greenish-brown spikelets that are clustered at the ends of its stems. Koeleria vestita is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for insects."
