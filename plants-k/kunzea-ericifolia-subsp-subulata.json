    "intro": "Kunzea ericifolia subsp. subulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved kunzea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are densely arranged along the stems. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in winter, attracting a variety of pollinators. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role and is also used in horticulture for its ornamental qualities."
