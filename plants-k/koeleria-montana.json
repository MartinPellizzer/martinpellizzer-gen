    "intro": "Koeleria montana, commonly known as the mountain grass or bluegrass, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Koeleria montana is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant and low-maintenance plants."
