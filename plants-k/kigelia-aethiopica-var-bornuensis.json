    "intro": "Kigelia aethiopica var. bornuensis, commonly known as the African peach or sausage tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its long, pendulous, fleshy fruits that resemble sausages, which are typically yellow or orange when ripe. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets and produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers with a strong, sweet scent. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in savanna and woodland habitats. The fruit is edible, though its texture is firm and somewhat rubbery, and it is used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some regions."
