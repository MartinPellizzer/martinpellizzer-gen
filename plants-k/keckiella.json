    "intro": "Keckiella, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Keckiella species are characterized by their showy, yellow to orange composite flowers and hairy, drought-tolerant foliage. They typically grow from 1 to 3 feet tall and are adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Many species are used in xeriscaping due to their low water requirements and ornamental value."
