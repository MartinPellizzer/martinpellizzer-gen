    "intro": "Kohleria longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved kohleria, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Kohleria longifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
