    "intro": "Kalbfussia muelleri, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of South America. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky or sandy soils. Kalbfussia muelleri is valued for its resilience and is often found in mountainous areas with limited soil coverage."
