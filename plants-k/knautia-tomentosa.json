    "intro": "Knautia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly knautia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant is recognized for its fluffy, silver-tomentose leaves and its showy, pink to purple flower clusters that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Knautia tomentosa is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
