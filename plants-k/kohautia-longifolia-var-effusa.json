    "intro": "Kohautia longifolia var. effusa, commonly known as the long-stemmed kohautia, is a rare and unique species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
