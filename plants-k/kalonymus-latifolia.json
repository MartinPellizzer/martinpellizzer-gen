It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by spherical, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
