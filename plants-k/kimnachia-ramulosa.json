    "intro": "Kimnachia ramulosa, commonly known as the red-tipped photinia, is a shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its distinctive red-tipped leaves that turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Kimnachia ramulosa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
