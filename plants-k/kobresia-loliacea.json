    "intro": "Kobresia loliacea, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Tibetan Plateau. It is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in high-altitude environments with cold, arid conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or bluish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to minimize water loss in harsh climates. Kobresia loliacea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting alpine ecosystems."
