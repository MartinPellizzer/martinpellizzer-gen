    "intro": "Koellensteinia graminoides, commonly known as the slender rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with linear, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense mats on rocky soils. Its reproductive strategy involves self-pollination, which is common in plants growing in isolated habitats. Koellensteinia graminoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
