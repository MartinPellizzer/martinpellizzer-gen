    "intro": "Kanahia carlsbergiana, commonly known as the Carlsberg grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species."
