    "intro": "Koeleria nitida subvar. vestita, commonly known as the silver grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, silvery hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a soft, feathery texture. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its elegant, airy look and drought tolerance."
