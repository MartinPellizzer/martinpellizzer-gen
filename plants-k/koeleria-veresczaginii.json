    "intro": "Koeleria veresczaginii, commonly known as the Siberian grass, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Siberia and Central Asia. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its low-growing, herbaceous structure. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, blue to purple flowers, typical of many grass species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, arctic or alpine environments. Koeleria veresczaginii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
