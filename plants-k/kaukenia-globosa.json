It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Kaukenia globosa is also valued for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
