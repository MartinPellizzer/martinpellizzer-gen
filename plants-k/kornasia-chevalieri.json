    "intro": "Kornasia chevalieri, commonly known as the Chevalier's kornasia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheat and knotweeds, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces distinctive, pale yellow or greenish-white blooms that appear in late spring to early summer. Kornasia chevalieri is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
