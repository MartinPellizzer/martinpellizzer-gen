    "intro": "Kalakia marginata f. marginata, commonly known as the narrowleaf k\u0101hui, is a perennial herb native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories on the islands of Maui and Moloka\u02bbi. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
