    "intro": "Kochia childsii, commonly known as the desert bluestem, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, blue-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Kochia childsii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
