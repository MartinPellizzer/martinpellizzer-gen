    "intro": "Kyrstenia, commonly known as the goldenstar, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, primarily native to South America, particularly Brazil. These plants are characterized by their showy, yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Kyrstenia species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, often reaching heights of up to 10 meters. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
