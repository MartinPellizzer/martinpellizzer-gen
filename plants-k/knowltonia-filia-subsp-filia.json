    "intro": "Knowltonia filia subsp. filia, commonly known as the Florida flame anemone, is a rare and striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Florida Keys. It is characterized by its vibrant red, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant produces a unique, showy inflorescence that attracts pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often form a rosette structure that helps collect and retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
