    "intro": "Kingianthus paniculatus, commonly known as the yellow panic grass, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and clusters of yellowish-green inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and savannas, where it thrives in full sun. Its fibrous root system helps it stabilize in sandy or nutrient-poor soils. The species is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive, feathery appearance."
