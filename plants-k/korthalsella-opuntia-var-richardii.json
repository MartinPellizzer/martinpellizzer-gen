    "intro": "Korthalsella opuntia var. richardii, commonly known as the Richardson's prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems that store water, typical of desert plants. The plant features spines and may produce yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. The fruit, which is edible, develops from the flower and is often used in local cuisines."
