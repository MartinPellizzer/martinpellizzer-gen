    "intro": "Koanophyllon palmeri var. tonsa, commonly known as the Desert Evening Primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Onagraceae, which includes other evening primroses and related species. The plant is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures."
