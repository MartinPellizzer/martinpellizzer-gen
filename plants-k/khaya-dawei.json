    "intro": "Khaya dawei, commonly known as Burmese teak, is a tropical hardwood tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its large, compound leaves and yellowish to reddish-brown bark. The tree produces small, pod-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its durable, heavy wood used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
