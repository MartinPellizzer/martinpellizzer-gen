    "intro": "Koanophyllon littorale, commonly known as the coastal bluebunch, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing small blue to purple flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Koanophyllon littorale is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
