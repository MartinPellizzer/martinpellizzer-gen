    "intro": "Koeleria \u00d7 pseudoglauca subsp. csatoi, commonly known as the hybrid bluegrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and bluish-green foliage. It is native to the mountainous regions of western North America, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. The plant produces slender spikes of small, spikelet-bearing flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth makes it suitable for use in low-maintenance landscaping and erosion control. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, which can complicate taxonomic classification."
