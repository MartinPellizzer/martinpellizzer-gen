    "intro": "Kunzea brachyandra, commonly known as the narrow-leaved kunzea, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often in heathlands or woodlands. It is well adapted to dry conditions and can tolerate coastal salt spray. Kunzea brachyandra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native gardens."
