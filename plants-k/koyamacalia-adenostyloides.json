    "intro": "Koyamacalia adenostyloides, commonly known as the Hawaiian koyama, is a rare flowering plant endemic to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist areas of rainforests, where it thrives in the humid and cool climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species. Conservation efforts are underway to protect and propagate this unique botanical species."
