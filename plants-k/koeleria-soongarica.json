    "intro": "Koeleria soongarica, commonly known as the Tibetan feather grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It has fine, wiry leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length, forming a dense mat on the ground. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale blue to purple flowers. It is well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments with poor soil conditions. Koeleria soongarica is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in rocky or arid areas."
