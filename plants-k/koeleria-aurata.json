    "intro": "Koeleria aurata, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and delicate, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, pale blue or white flowers. Koeleria aurata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its ornamental value also makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and naturalized landscapes."
