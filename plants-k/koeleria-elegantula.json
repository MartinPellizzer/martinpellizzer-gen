    "intro": "Koeleria elegantula, commonly known as the elegant grass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early spring, adding a subtle ornamental value to the landscape. Koeleria elegantula is often used in native plant gardens due to its low maintenance and ecological benefits."
