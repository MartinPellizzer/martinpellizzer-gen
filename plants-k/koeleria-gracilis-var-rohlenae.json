    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis var. rohlenae, commonly known as the slender rohlen's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada in California. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact, tufted growth habit, which help it survive in harsh, alpine conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species."
