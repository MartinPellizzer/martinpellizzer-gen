    "intro": "Koyamacalia nokoensis, commonly known as the Noko Island lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the remote island of Noko in the Pacific Ocean. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant has strap-like, evergreen leaves that form a dense rosette near the ground. It thrives in well-drained, volcanic soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its arid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
