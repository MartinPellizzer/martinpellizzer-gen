    "intro": "Krameria cuspidata, commonly known as the hooked krameria, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, hooked fruits that are adapted for seed dispersal by animals. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Krameria cuspidata is notable for its ecological role in supporting local insect and bird populations."
