It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in grassland or shrubland habitats. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a rough texture.
