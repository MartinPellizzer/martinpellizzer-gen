    "intro": "Kobresia fissiglumis, commonly known as the fissile spikegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Kobresia fissiglumis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine organisms."
