    "intro": "Kali turgidum, commonly known as the water plantain, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments. It belongs to the family Alismataceae and is characterized by its broad, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. Kali turgidum thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in its natural habitat."
