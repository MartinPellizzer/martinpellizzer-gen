    "intro": "Kobresia kobresioidea, commonly known as the Tibetan feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It forms dense, mat-like growths that help stabilize soil in arid and cold environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. It is adapted to harsh conditions, including strong winds and limited nutrients. Kobresia kobresioidea plays an important ecological role in maintaining the stability of alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
