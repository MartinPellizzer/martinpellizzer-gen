    "intro": "Kohleria reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined kohleria, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that come in a range of vibrant colors. The plant typically features velvety, dark green leaves with intricate, net-like venation patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Kohleria reticulata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
