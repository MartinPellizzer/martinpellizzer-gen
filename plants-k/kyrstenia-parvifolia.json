It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in dense clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Kyrstenia parvifolia is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance."
