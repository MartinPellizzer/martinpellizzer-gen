    "intro": "Koyamasia curtisii var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly koyamasia, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to withstand the high humidity and frequent rainfall of its native environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
