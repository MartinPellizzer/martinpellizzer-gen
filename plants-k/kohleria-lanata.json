    "intro": "Kohleria lanata, commonly known as the woolly kohleria, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Kohleria lanata is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
