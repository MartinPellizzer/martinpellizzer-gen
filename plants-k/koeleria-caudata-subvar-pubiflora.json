    "intro": "Koeleria caudata subvar. pubiflora, commonly known as the hairy flaxgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas. Its low-growing form makes it suitable for erosion control and as a ornamental plant in native gardens."
