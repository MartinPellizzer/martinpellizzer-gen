    "intro": "Koeleria tunicata, commonly known as the tunicate grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, compact foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Koeleria tunicata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common component of grassland ecosystems. Its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil make it ecologically significant in its native habitats."
