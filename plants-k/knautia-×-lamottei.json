    "intro": "Knautia \u00d7 lamottei, commonly known as the hybrid knautia, is a perennial plant belonging to the Caprifoliaceae family. It is a cross between Knautia arvensis and Knautia montana, resulting in a plant with distinctive, fluffy, pinkish-white flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Its ornamental value comes from its showy blooms and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
