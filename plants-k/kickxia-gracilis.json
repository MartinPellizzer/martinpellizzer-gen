    "intro": "Kickxia gracilis, commonly known as slender rock-lettuce, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or arid environments. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to retain moisture in dry conditions. Kickxia gracilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
