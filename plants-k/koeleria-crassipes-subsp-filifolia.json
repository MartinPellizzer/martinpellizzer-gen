    "intro": "Koeleria crassipes subsp. filifolia, commonly known as the threadleaf wildrye, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its fine, thread-like leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. This subspecies is valued for its drought tolerance and is often used in restoration projects and as a forage plant."
