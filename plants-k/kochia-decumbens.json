    "intro": "Kochia decumbens, commonly known as bluestem kochia, is a low-growing, annual plant native to North America. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and has prostrate or ascending stems that are often hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which appear in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Kochia decumbens is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to arid environments."
