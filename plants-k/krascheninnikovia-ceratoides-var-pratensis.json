    "intro": "Krascheninnikovia ceratoides var. pratensis, commonly known as the prairie sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the central and eastern United States. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in open prairies and disturbed sites. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for pollinators."
