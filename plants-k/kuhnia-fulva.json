    "intro": "Kuhnia fulva, commonly known as the yellow marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Kuhnia fulva plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil with its extensive root system."
