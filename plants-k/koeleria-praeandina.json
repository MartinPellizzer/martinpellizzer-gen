    "intro": "Koeleria praeandina, commonly known as the Andean feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and delicate, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental appeal and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable climate conditions."
