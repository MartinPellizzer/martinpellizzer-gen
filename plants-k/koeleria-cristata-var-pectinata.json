    "intro": "Koeleria cristata var. pectinata, commonly known as the tufted grass or silky wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features dense, tufted clusters of fine, silver-blue foliage that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
