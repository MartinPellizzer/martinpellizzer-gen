    "intro": "Kuhnia pyrifolia, commonly known as the fireleaf plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its striking, lobed leaves that resemble the shape of a burning leaf. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads, which are typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Kuhnia pyrifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
