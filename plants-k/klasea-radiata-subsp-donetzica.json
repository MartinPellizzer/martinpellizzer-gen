    "intro": "Klasea radiata subsp. donetzica, commonly known as the Donetz karst plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the karst regions of Eastern Europe. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the unique microclimatic conditions of its habitat. The plant features a slender, upright stem with opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white and appear in clusters, contributing to its subtle appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
