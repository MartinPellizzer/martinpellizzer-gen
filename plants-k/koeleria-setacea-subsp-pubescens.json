    "intro": "Koeleria setacea subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
