    "intro": "Kyllinga brevifolia var. robusta, commonly known as swamp kyllinga, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It features rosettes of succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically reddish or purple in color. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny white or pale pink flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in moist soil. Kyllinga brevifolia var. robusta is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
