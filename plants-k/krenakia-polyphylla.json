    "intro": "Krenakia polyphylla, commonly known as the mountain hellebore, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a robust rhizome and produces tall, erect stems with large, dark green, palmately lobed leaves. The plant blooms with showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested or alpine habitats. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care."
