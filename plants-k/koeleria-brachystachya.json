    "intro": "Koeleria brachystachya, commonly known as the short-stalked wheatgrass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, tufted foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in cold, dry environments and is often found in alpine or arctic tundra habitats. Koeleria brachystachya is also valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
