    "intro": "Kneiffia riparia, commonly known as the river sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It typically grows in moist soils along rivers, streams, and lakeshores, thriving in environments with consistent water availability. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets. Its root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic environments. Kneiffia riparia plays an important ecological role in supporting aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
