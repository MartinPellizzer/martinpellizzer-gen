    "intro": "Kingidium, commonly known as the fairy lantern or ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. They are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that often resemble small lanterns or ghosts, hence their common names. The leaves are usually opposite and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Kingidium species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are used in traditional medicine in some regions."
