    "intro": "Koeleria phleoides var. hypathera, commonly known as the narrowleaf tufted grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It is drought-tolerant and adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a hardy plant in xerophytic ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in its range."
