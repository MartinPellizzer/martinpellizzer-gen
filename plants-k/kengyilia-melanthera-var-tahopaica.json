    "intro": "Kengyilia melanthera var. tahopaica, commonly known as the Tahopea larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, sparsely hairy flowers that typically range in color from blue to purple. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of these ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
