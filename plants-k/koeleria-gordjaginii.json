    "intro": "Koeleria gordjaginii, commonly known as the Armenian grass, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It belongs to the\u79be\u672c\u79d1 (Poaceae) family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments.
