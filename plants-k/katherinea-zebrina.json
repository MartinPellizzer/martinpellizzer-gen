It is characterized by its vibrant, variegated foliage that features alternating green and white or yellow stripes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Katherinea zebrina is often grown as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
