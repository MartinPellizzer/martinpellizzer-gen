    "intro": "Krameria revoluta, commonly known as the desert candle, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, candle-like stems that are covered in dense, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Krameria revoluta is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in dry conditions. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a distinctive species in desert ecosystems."
