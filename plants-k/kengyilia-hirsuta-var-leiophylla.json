    "intro": "Kengyilia hirsuta var. leiophylla, commonly known as the soft-leaved kengyilia, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are less pubescent compared to the typical variety. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
