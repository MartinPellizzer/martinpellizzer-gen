    "intro": "Koenigia rumicifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a white, waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its succulent leaves help it retain water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Koenigia rumicifolia is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along dry streambeds and rocky slopes."
