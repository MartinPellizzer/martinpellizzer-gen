It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that ranges from dark green to nearly black in color. The plant produces clusters of showy, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broad, leathery, and arranged in whorls around the stems. The species is adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade, making it a common sight in forest understories."
