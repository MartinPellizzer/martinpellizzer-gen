    "intro": "Kalanchoe cochleatum, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, thick leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are also notable for their ability to propagate new plants through basal offsets. Kalanchoe cochleatum is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
