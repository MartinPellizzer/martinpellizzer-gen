    "intro": "Kyllinga fraterna, commonly known as the common kyllinga, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. Kyllinga fraterna is often found in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in wetland habitats."
