It features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, adding visual interest throughout the growing season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for wetland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense clumps, providing both beauty and ecological benefits."
