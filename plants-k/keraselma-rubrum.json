    "intro": "Keraselma rubrum, commonly known as the red velvet fern, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that ranges from deep red to purple, depending on the light conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in the early morning. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and drought-tolerant landscaping."
