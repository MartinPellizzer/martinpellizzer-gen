    "intro": "Kobresia ecklonii, commonly known as the cushion grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high altitudes of southern Africa. It forms dense, compact cushions or mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in its harsh environment. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, reducing water loss. It is adapted to cold, arid conditions and thrives in rocky or sandy soils. Kobresia ecklonii plays an important ecological role in alpine and subalpine habitats."
