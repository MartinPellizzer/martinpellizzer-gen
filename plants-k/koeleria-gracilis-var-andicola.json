    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis var. andicola, commonly known as the Andean slender grass, is a variant of the slender wheatgrass native to the Andes region. It is a low-growing perennial grass characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, wiry stems. The plant typically thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in rocky or alpine soils. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce numerous tiny flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. This variety is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in its native habitat."
