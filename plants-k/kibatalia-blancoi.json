    "intro": "Kibatalia blancoi, commonly known as the white kibatalia, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes cashew and mango trees. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its fruit is a small, spiny drupe that contains a single seed. Due to habitat loss, Kibatalia blancoi is critically endangered and is found only in a few restricted areas in the northern part of the country."
