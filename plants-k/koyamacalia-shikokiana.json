It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountainous regions. Its leaves are lanceolate and often covered in a fine pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
