    "intro": "Kingdon-wardia codonopsidoides, commonly known as the giant codonopsis, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter, often displaying vibrant colors such as yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The botanical significance of this species lies in its unique floral structure and its role in the ecological dynamics of its native ecosystems."
