    "intro": "Kryptostoma oligoschistum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed cryptostoma, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, linear leaves that form a dense, low-growing rosette. The plant has a short, rhizomatous stem and produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are typically clustered in groups of four. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists studying fern diversity and evolution."
