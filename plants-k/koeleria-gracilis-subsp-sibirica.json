    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis subsp. sibirica, commonly known as Siberian slimgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Eurasia. It typically grows in alpine and arctic environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude regions."
