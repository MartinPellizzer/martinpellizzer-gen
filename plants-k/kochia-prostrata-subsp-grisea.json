    "intro": "Kochia prostrata subsp. grisea, commonly known as silverleaf kochia, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features fleshy, bluish-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on short, erect stalks. It is adapted to thrive in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. Kochia prostrata subsp. grisea is an annual plant that is highly drought-tolerant and can spread rapidly through wind-dispersed seeds."
