    "intro": "Koeleria cristata f. lanata, commonly known as the woolly tufted grass, is a variant of the tufted grass species native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy appearance due to the presence of long, soft hairs on its leaves and inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue or purple flowers. This form is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-maintenance conditions."
