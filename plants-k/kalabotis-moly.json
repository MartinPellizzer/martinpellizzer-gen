    "intro": "Kalabotis moly, commonly known as the common moly, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by rounded, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a rough texture and a slightly bitter taste. Kalabotis moly is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered a weed in some agricultural areas."
