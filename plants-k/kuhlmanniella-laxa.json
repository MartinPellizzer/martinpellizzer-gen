    "intro": "Kuhlmanniella laxa, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is extensive and adapted to anchor it in loose, sandy soils. Kuhlmanniella laxa is well-suited to harsh environments and is often found in disturbed or dry habitats."
