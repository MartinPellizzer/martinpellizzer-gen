    "intro": "Kochia prostrata var. rubens, commonly known as burning bush or red tumbleweed, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, covered with small, ovate leaves that are typically bluish-green. The plant produces fluffy, pink to red bracts that give it its striking appearance, especially in late summer and autumn. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Kochia prostrata var. rubens is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
