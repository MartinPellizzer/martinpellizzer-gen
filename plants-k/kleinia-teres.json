It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped growth pattern and fleshy, silver-green leaves. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers during the winter months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
