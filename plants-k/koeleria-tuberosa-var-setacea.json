    "intro": "Koeleria tuberosa var. setacea, commonly known as the tufted winter grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, compact inflorescence that resembles a spikelet cluster. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold climates, often found in alpine environments. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with the leaves often appearing in dense tufts at the base. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
