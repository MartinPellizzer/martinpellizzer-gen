    "intro": "Koeberlinia spinosa var. spinosa, commonly known as the spinous koeberlinia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces small, round fruits that contain seeds covered in a hairy coating. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
