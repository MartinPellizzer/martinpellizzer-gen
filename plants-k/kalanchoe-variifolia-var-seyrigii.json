It features rosettes of fleshy, thick leaves that are typically green with white or yellow markings. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the winter months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight. Due to its compact growth habit, it is often used as a decorative indoor plant or in rock gardens."
