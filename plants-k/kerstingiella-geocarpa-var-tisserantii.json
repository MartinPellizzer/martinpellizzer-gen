    "intro": "Kerstingiella geocarpa var. tisserantii, commonly known as the underground fig, is a rare and unique plant species native to the Comoros Islands. It is characterized by its subterranean growth habit, with the fruit developing entirely beneath the soil surface. The plant produces a single, large, fleshy fruit that is often mistaken for a root or tuber due to its concealed nature. Botanically, it belongs to the Moraceae family, which includes figs and mulberries. Its unusual growth pattern and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
