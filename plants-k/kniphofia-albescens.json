    "intro": "Kniphofia albescens, commonly known as the white torch lily, is a striking perennial plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Hemerocallis family and is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems that bear clusters of bright white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces long, narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually bright green and form a dense rosette at the base. Kniphofia albescens thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its showy blooms, which last only one day, add dramatic visual impact to any garden setting."
