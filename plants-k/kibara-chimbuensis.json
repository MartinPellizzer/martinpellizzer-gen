    "intro": "Kibara chimbuensis, commonly known as the Chimbu kibara, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
