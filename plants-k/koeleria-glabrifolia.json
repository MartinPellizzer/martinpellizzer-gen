    "intro": "Koeleria glabrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf wintergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairless or nearly so. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. Koeleria glabrifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
