    "intro": "Kodalyodendron, commonly known as the kodalyodendron tree, is a rare and unique species within the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is typically found in mountainous regions with cool, moist climates. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing year-round visual interest. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, Kodalyodendron is considered a rare and endangered species."
