These plants are characterized by their compact rosettes of velvety, fleshy leaves and showy, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of purple, white, and pink. Krynitzkia species are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their attractive appearance and ability to thrive in indoor environments.
