It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and elliptical, glossy leaves with prominent, broad veins. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by round, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
