    "intro": "Klotzschiphytum mauritianum, commonly known as the Mauritius grass, is a flowering plant native to the island of Mauritius. It is a perennial herb with tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
