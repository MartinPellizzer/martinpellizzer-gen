    "intro": "Kentia ledermanniana, commonly known as the Ledermann's Kentia, is a species of cycad native to New Caledonia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and dense, feather-like leaves that form a rosette at the top. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
