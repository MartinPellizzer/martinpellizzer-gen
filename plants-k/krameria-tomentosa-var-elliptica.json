    "intro": "Krameria tomentosa var. elliptica, commonly known as the woolly krameria, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly gray foliage and clusters of yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to desert environments. Krameria tomentosa var. elliptica is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
