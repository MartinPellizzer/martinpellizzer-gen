    "intro": "Kelleronia revoilii, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact rosette of velvety, waxy leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, often with a contrasting central stripe. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Kelleronia revoilii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
