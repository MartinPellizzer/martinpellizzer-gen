    "intro": "Kochia triptera, commonly known as the sea bladder, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well-adapted to coastal environments. Its ability to store water in its leaves helps it survive in arid and windy conditions. Kochia triptera is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize dunes."
