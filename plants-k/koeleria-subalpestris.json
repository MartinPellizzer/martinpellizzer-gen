    "intro": "Koeleria subalpestris, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features fine, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal, aiding in its propagation across rocky and alpine environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, slopes, and along mountain trails. Koeleria subalpestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in harsh, high-altitude habitats."
