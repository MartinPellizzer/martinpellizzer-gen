It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, aromatic leaves. The tree produces small, white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in construction and traditional crafts. Due to its slow growth and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
