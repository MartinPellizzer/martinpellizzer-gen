    "intro": "Kyllinga cylindrica, commonly known as the round spikerush, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its cylindrical, grass-like stems and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its roots form dense clusters that help stabilize soil. Kyllinga cylindrica is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and prevent erosion."
