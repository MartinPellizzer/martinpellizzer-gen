It is characterized by its basal rosette of linear, hairy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in racemose inflorescences. Native to arid and rocky habitats in southern Africa, it is adapted to drought conditions with a succulent stem and reduced leaf surface. The plant has a short flowering period, typically in spring, and relies on insect pollination. It is often found in crevices and on rocky outcrops, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
