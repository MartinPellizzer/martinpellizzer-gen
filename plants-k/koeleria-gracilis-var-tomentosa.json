    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis var. tomentosa, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the North American prairies. It features fine, slender leaves covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant gardens."
