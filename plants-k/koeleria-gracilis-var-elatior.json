    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis var. elatior, commonly known as the tall slender grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky areas. It has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought. Its ecological importance includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in erosion-prone areas."
