    "intro": "Kohautia kimuenzae, commonly known as the Kimuenzae grass, is a small perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
