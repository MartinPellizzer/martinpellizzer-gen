    "intro": "Kyrstenia borealis, commonly known as the northern kyrstenia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, white or pale pink flowers in the summer months. The plant has a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it retain moisture in its cold, harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to long periods of snow cover. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
