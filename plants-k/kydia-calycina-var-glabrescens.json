    "intro": "Kydia calycina var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smoothleaf Kydia, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features woody stems with smooth, grayish bark and lance-shaped, aromatic leaves that are typically pubescent but become glabrous with age. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by distinctive, showy, red, inflated fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Its botanical characteristics make it a notable species in xerophytic plant communities."
