    "intro": "Koeleria bergii, commonly known as the mountain grass or Berg's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage that thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Koeleria bergii is adapted to harsh alpine environments and is often found in high-altitude meadows. Its hardy nature makes it a valuable plant for ecological restoration in arid and semi-arid regions."
