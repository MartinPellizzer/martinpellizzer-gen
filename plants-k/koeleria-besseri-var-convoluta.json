    "intro": "Koeleria besseri var. convoluta, commonly known as the twisted bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, typically forming dense mats or low clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
