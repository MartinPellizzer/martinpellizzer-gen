    "intro": "Kleinia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf ice plant, is a small succulent native to South Africa. It features dense, prostrate growth with fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, typical of xerophytic adaptations. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple, often blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its compact size and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
