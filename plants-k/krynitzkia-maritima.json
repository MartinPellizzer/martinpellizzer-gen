    "intro": "Krynitzkia maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-green leaves, which are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong winds. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Krynitzkia maritima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes through its extensive root system."
