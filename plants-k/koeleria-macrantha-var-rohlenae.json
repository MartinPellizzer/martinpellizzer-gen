    "intro": "Koeleria macrantha var. rohlenae, commonly known as the rohlen's wild oat, is a perennial grass species native to the high elevations of the Rocky Mountains. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous pale blue to purple florets. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Its foliage is typically narrow and grass-like, with hairy stems that help reduce water loss. This variety is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its unique ecological niche and potential for use in restoration projects."
