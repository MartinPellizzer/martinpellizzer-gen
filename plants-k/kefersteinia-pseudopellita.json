    "intro": "Kefersteinia pseudopellita, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent leaves and its showy, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of dense forests. Its unique morphology and elusive nature make it a subject of fascination for botanists and plant enthusiasts alike. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
