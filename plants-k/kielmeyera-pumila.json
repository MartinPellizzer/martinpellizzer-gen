    "intro": "Kielmeyera pumila, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree or *Caryocar pumila*, is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It has smooth, dark green leaves that are opposite and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its bark is thick and flaky, often peeling in thin, papery layers. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions, though it can become invasive in some areas."
