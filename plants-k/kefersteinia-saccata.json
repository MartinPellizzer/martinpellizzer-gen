    "intro": "Kefersteinia saccata, commonly known as the sac-like orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its distinctive sac-like structure on its flowers, which is a rare morphological feature among orchids. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its flowers are usually small and greenish-white, with a subtle fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Kefersteinia saccata is considered a delicate and endangered species."
