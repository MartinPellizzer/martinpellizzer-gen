    "intro": "Koeleria ciliata, commonly known as the silky grass vetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silky-haired leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Koeleria ciliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas."
