    "intro": "Kohleria baezana, commonly known as the Baezana gloxinia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Kohleria baezana is popular among gardeners for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
