    "intro": "Koanophyllon isillumense, commonly known as the luminous leaf cactus, is a rare and unique plant native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, translucent green leaves that emit a faint bioluminescent glow during the night, a feature attributed to specialized chloroplasts. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, enabling survival in harsh, dry environments. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Koanophyllon isillumense is considered a vulnerable species."
