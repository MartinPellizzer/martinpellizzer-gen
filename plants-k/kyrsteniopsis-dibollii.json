    "intro": "Kyrsteniopsis dibollii, commonly known as the Bornean star orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers with a unique coloration pattern. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in the dense canopy. Its flowers are highly specialized, often featuring intricate structures that facilitate pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Kyrsteniopsis dibollii is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
