    "intro": "Kotschya capitulifera var. capitulifera, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its rosette-forming basal leaves and a tall, branching stem that bears a cluster of yellow flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds dispersed by wind. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in desert ecosystems."
