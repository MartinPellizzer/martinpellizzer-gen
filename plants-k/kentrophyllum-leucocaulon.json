    "intro": "Kentrophyllum leucocaulon, commonly known as the white-stemmed kentrophyllum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its slender, white-veined stems and small, clustered white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with a fine, waxy coating. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
