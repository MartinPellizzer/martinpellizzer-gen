    "intro": "Kunzea sulphurea, commonly known as golden kunzea, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish powder, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure. Kunzea sulphurea is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional bush medicine."
