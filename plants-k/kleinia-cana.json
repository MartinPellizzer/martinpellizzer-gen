    "intro": "Kleinia cana, commonly known as the coastal beardgrass, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fleshy, grey-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds. Kleinia cana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
