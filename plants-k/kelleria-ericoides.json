    "intro": "Kelleria ericoides, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly leathery. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Kelleria ericoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, compact foliage."
