    "intro": "Karwinskia johnstonii, commonly known as the Johnston's karwinskia, is a rare shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, providing drought resistance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
