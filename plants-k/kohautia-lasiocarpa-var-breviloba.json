    "intro": "Kohautia lasiocarpa var. breviloba, commonly known as the short-stalked kohautia, is a rare and unique member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and delicate, umbellate inflorescences. Native to New Zealand, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, and it produces small, dry fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
