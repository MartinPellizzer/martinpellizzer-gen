    "intro": "Koyamacalia farfarifolia, commonly known as the Farfarifolia koyama, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its botanical features make it a unique subject for botanical study and conservation efforts. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
