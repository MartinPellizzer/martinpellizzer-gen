It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the dry season, adding ornamental value. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
