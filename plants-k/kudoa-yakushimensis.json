    "intro": "Kudoa yakushimensis, commonly known as the Japanese fish parasite, is a species of dinoflagellate belonging to the family Peridinidae. It is primarily found in marine environments, particularly in the waters around Japan, where it infects various fish species. The organism is characterized by its complex life cycle, which includes both free-living and parasitic stages. It forms colonies that can be visible to the naked eye, often appearing as gelatinous masses. Due to its role in marine ecosystems, it plays a significant part in the food web and is studied for its ecological and biological implications."
