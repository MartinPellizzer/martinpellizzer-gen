    "intro": "Koeleria pubescens var. tripolitana, commonly known as the Tripolitan hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fine, hairy leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is adapted to poor, well-drained soils. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
