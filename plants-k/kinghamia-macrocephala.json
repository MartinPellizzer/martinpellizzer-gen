    "intro": "Kinghamia macrocephala, commonly known as the Christmas bush, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of south-eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, glossy green foliage and distinctive red, lantern-like flowers that bloom during the winter months. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it well-suited to coastal environments. Its unique floral structure attracts nectar-feeding birds and insects, playing a role in local pollination networks. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal display."
