    "intro": "Koeleria longiglumis, commonly known as the long glume grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairy. Its seeds are enclosed in bracts, a feature that aids in seed dispersal in its native habitat. Koeleria longiglumis is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient environments."
