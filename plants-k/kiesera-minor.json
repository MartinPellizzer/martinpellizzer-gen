    "intro": "Kiesera minor, commonly known as the lesser kieseraria, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems with opposite, linear leaves that are usually less than 5 cm in length. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters during the late spring to early summer. Kiesera minor is often found in calcareous soils and is considered a characteristic species of mesophilous forests."
