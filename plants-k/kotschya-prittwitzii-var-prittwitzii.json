    "intro": "Kotschya prittwitzii var. prittwitzii, commonly known as the Pritchard's kotschya, is a rare and small shrub native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and compact growth habit, typically reaching heights of less than 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value to its appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
