    "intro": "Kobresia filifolia subsp. subfilifolia, commonly known as the woolly kobresia, is a low-growing perennial grass found in arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant has narrow, silver-gray leaves with a fuzzy texture, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in high-altitude meadows and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its ability to stabilize soil makes it an important species in degraded landscapes."
