It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows as an understory plant in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
