    "intro": "Koeleria pseudocristata f. densevestita, commonly known as the dense-haired koeleria, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, hairy foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
