    "intro": "Klasea centauroides subsp. polycephala, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features multiple stems that emerge from a central base, giving it a distinctive, multi-headed appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant's latex sap is milky and can be toxic if ingested, making it important to handle with care."
