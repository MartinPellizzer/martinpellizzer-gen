    "intro": "Krubera, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a remarkable aquatic plant native to the Amazon River basin. It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense underwater colonies. Its rhizomes spread horizontally along the substrate, enabling it to colonize new areas rapidly. Krubera plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and oxygen for aquatic life."
