It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and silvery-gray foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
