    "intro": "Koeleria britannica subsp. pontarlieri, commonly known as the British grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the British Isles. It typically forms dense tufts with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas, heaths, and rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
