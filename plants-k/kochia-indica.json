    "intro": "Kochia indica, commonly known as burning bush, is a flowering plant native to Asia and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, feather-like leaves that turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Kochia indica is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking seasonal color changes. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it adaptable to a variety of garden environments."
