    "intro": "Krigia tenella, commonly known as the desert star, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and a fibrous root system adapted to arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in desert landscapes. Krigia tenella is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread quickly."
