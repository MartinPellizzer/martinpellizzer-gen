    "intro": "Koeleria subspicata, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Koeleria subspicata is also valued for its nutritional content and has been used by indigenous peoples for food and medicinal purposes."
