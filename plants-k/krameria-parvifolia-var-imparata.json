    "intro": "Krameria parvifolia var. imparata, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a shrub characterized by its spiny stems and small, waxy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Krameria parvifolia var. imparata plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
