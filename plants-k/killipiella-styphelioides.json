    "intro": "Killipiella styphelioides, commonly known as the mountain rockrose, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in the Andes Mountains. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Killipiella styphelioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
