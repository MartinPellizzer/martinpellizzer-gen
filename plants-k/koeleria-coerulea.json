    "intro": "Koeleria coerulea, commonly known as bluegrass, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Koeleria coerulea is often found in prairies, meadows, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife. Its fibrous root system helps prevent erosion in various habitats."
