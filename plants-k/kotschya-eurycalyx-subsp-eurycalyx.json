    "intro": "Kotschya eurycalyx subsp. eurycalyx, commonly known as the broad-calyx kotschya, is a shrub native to the arid regions of northern Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of whitish pubescence. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its flowers are followed by distinctive, broad, fleshy fruits that are adapted for dispersal by animals. This species is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is an important component of its native ecosystems."
