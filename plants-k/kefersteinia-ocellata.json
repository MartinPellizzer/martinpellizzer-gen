    "intro": "Kefersteinia ocellata, commonly known as the spotted leaf cactus, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its unique, spiny stems and showy, often pink or purple flowers. The plant features a compact growth habit with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces small, clustered flowers during the warmer months. Kefersteinia ocellata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions."
