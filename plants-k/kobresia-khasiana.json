    "intro": "Kobresia khasiana, commonly known as the Khasi grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, low-growing foliage, often forming dense mats on rocky or alpine slopes. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Kobresia khasiana is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude meadows and grasslands. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine flora and fauna."
