    "intro": "Koeleria figarei, commonly known as the Figarei grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and can tolerate high levels of sunlight. Its growth habit makes it suitable for use in erosion control and as a component of native plant gardens. Koeleria figarei plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native habitat."
