It is a low-growing perennial grass that typically forms dense, cushion-like mats. This species is adapted to high-altitude environments, often found in alpine and subalpine regions. Its small, spike-like inflorescences contain tiny flowers that are wind-pollinated. Kobresia burangensis plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in its harsh, mountainous habitat."
