It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a rough texture due to the fine hairs covering them. This species is often found in arid or semi-arid environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
