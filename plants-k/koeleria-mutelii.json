    "intro": "Koeleria mutelii, commonly known as the mutel's grass, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Koeleria mutelii is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Its low-growing structure and drought tolerance make it a resilient species in harsh climates."
