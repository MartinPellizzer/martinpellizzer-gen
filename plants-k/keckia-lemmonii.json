    "intro": "Keckia lemmonii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with fleshy, blue-green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is adapted to withstand drought conditions, storing water in its thick, succulent stems and leaves. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday. Keckia lemmonii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
