    "intro": "Kallstroemia peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular beargrass, is a unique plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, sandy soils along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered white or pink flowers in late spring. It is adapted to coastal environments and can tolerate salt spray and periodic flooding. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
