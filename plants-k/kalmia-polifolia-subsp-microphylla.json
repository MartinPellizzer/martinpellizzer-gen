    "intro": "Kalmia polifolia subsp. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved mountain laurel, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, leathery foliage with elliptical, dark green leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, usually pink or red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
