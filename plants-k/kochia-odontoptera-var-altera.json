    "intro": "Kochia odontoptera var. altera, commonly known as the silverleaf kochia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance, especially when mature. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Kochia odontoptera var. altera is adapted to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in xeric landscapes."
