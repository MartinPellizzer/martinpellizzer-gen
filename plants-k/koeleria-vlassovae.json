It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, pale blue to white flowers. Koeleria vlassovae typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies in alpine ecosystems."
