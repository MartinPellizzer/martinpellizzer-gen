    "intro": "Kobresia capillifolia var. tibetica, commonly known as Tibetan hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fine, hair-like leaves that are often covered in a powdery bloom. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of alpine and subalpine ecosystems. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in these extreme habitats. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is an important species for studying plant adaptations to high-altitude environments."
