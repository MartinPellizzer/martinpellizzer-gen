    "intro": "Knightia strobilina, commonly known as the mountain pine, is a species of conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of coniferous species. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against environmental stressors. Knightia strobilina is well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and plays a role in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
