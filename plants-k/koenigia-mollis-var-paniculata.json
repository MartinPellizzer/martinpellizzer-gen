It features striking silver-gray foliage with a velvety texture, and its leaves are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, delicate white or pale green flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a desirable addition to both indoor and outdoor gardens."
