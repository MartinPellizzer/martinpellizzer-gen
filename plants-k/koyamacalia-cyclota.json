    "intro": "Koyamacalia cyclota, commonly known as the cyclocarp, is a flowering plant native to the island of Koyama in the South Pacific. It is characterized by its unique, spiral-shaped inflorescence that resembles a whirlpool, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom throughout the year. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often growing in dense clusters around the base. Koyamacalia cyclota is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine by the local communities."
