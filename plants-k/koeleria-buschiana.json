    "intro": "Koeleria buschiana, commonly known as the Busch's wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry blades that often form dense mats. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and alpine environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its flowering heads are small, spike-like clusters that produce minute seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Koeleria buschiana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
