    "intro": "Koeleria grandiflora var. hirtella, commonly known as the hairy leaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing white to pale blue flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
