    "intro": "Kunzea sprengelioides, commonly known as the coastal kunzea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. These flowers are followed by small, woody capsules that contain the plant's seeds. Kunzea sprengelioides is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
