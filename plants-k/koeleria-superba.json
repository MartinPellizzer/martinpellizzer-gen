    "intro": "Koeleria superba, commonly known as the Alaska grass or sky pilot, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a member of the Poaceae family, characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Koeleria superba is adapted to cold climates and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its short stature and low-growing form help it withstand harsh weather conditions."
