    "intro": "Koeleria niederleinii, commonly known as the Niederlein's grass, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, blue to purple flowers, typical of the genus Koeleria. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native habitat."
