    "intro": "Kibara trichantha, commonly known as the African dandelion, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features a basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its bright yellow flowers are followed by spherical seed heads that release lightweight seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. Kibara trichantha is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed habitats."
