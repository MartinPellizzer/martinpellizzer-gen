    "intro": "Kopsia panormitana, commonly known as the Panormitan kopsia, is a flowering plant native to the island of Panormitis in Cyprus. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Kopsia panormitana is considered a rare and endemic species."
