    "intro": "Knautia arvensis subsp. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf knautia, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a hairy surface, and stem leaves that are smaller and often reduced. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers, which are arranged in spherical heads and bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fluffy flower heads and long flowering period."
