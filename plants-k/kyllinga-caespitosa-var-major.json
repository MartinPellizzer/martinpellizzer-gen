    "intro": "Kyllinga caespitosa var. major, commonly known as the tussock grass or tussock sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of water bodies. The plant forms dense clumps or tussocks with slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of white or pale pink flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
