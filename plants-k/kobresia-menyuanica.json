    "intro": "Kobresia menyuanica, commonly known as the Tibetan feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It is characterized by its fine, soft, and densely tufted foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and alpine environments, where it thrives in cold and arid conditions. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. Kobresia menyuanica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity in its native habitat."
