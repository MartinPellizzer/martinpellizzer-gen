    "intro": "Koeleria altaica var. glabrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf oatgrass, is a flowering plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as tundra and wet meadows. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in arctic and alpine regions."
