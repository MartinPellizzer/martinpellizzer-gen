    "intro": "Kjellbergia celebica, commonly known as the Celebes cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the Moluccas in Indonesia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants due to their striking appearance. Kjellbergia celebica is also of interest to botanists for its evolutionary significance and ecological role in its native habitat."
