It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in dense spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to rocky or alpine soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
