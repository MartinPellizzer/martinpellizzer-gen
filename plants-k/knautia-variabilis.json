    "intro": "Knautia variabilis, commonly known as the variable knautia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces showy, pink to purple flowers from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Knautia variabilis is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
