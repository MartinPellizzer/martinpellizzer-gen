    "intro": "Kalmia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy alpine heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Appalachian Mountains. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink to red in color. The plant has leathery, dark green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its common name. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky, mountainous habitats. Kalmia hirsuta is an important component of the understory in mixed hardwood-conifer forests."
