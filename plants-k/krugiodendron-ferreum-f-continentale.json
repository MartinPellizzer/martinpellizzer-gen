    "intro": "Krugiodendron ferreum f. continentale, commonly known as the continental ironwood, is a rare and slow-growing plant native to the humid forests of South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and highly aromatic leaves that emit a distinctive, woody scent. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, followed by small, round fruits containing hard, seed-like structures. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat. Its unique botanical features make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
