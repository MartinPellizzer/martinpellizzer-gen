It is characterized by its striking, fiery orange-red petals and a yellow lip, which make it highly ornamental. The plant typically grows as a rhizomatous herb, with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often variegated. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Flowering occurs during the rainy season, producing clusters of showy blooms that attract pollinators."
