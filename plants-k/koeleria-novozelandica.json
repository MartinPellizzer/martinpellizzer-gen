    "intro": "Koeleria novozelandica, commonly known as New Zealand oatgrass, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in grasslands and along streambanks. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Koeleria novozelandica plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
