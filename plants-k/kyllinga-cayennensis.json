    "intro": "Kyllinga cayennensis, commonly known as the Cayenne arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet, marshy environments. The plant features arrowhead-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in suitable conditions. Kyllinga cayennensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
