    "intro": "Koniga halimifolia, commonly known as the sweet woodruff, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Plantain family (Plantaginaceae) and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and fragrant, small white flowers. The plant is known for its aromatic, vanilla-like scent, which comes from the presence of coumarin in its foliage. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and historical use in herbal medicine. Its seeds are also edible and have been traditionally used in culinary applications."
