    "intro": "Killickia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean, where it thrives in salty, sandy soils. The plant features striking blue or purple flower heads surrounded by spiny, leaf-like bracts. Killickia species are often used in coastal landscaping due to their hardiness and ability to tolerate salt spray. Their unique appearance and ecological adaptability make them an interesting subject for botanical study."
