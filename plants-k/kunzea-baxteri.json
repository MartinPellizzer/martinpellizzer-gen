    "intro": "Kunzea baxteri, commonly known as Baxter's kunzea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of Western Australia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. The plant features small, narrow leaves and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats. Kunzea baxteri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
