    "intro": "Kunzea glabrescens, commonly known as the slender kunzea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves, which are often covered in fine, short hairs. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its woody stems and dense foliage make it well adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. Kunzea glabrescens is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
