    "intro": "Koeleria timuchinii, commonly known as the Timur grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky areas. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid conditions. Koeleria timuchinii plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
