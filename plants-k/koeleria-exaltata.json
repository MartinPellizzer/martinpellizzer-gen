    "intro": "Koeleria exaltata, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a blue-gray sheen that helps reduce water loss. Koeleria exaltata is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
