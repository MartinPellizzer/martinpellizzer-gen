    "intro": "Kleinia squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly cushion plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form composed of fleshy, often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in umbels. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a woolly texture, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Kleinia squarrosa is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
