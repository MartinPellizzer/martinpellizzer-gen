    "intro": "Kobresia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf moss grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the Tibetan Plateau and other high-altitude regions of Asia. It forms dense, cushion-like mats that help stabilize soil in harsh, arid environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and can survive in nutrient-poor soils. Kobresia pygmaea plays an important ecological role in preventing erosion and providing habitat for high-altitude wildlife."
