It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops and ornamental plants. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in spring. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
