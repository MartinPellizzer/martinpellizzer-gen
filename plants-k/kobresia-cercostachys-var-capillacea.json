    "intro": "Kobresia cercostachys var. capillacea, commonly known as the Tibetan hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width, giving it a soft, mat-like appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often hidden beneath the foliage. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat."
