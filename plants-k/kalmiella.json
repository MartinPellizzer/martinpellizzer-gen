    "intro": "Kalmiella, commonly known as the \"false orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It consists of about 20 species, most of which are found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plants are typically small, herbaceous, and often have a unique, compact growth habit. They produce showy, often fragrant flowers that are typically white, pink, or purple in color. Kalmiella species are characterized by their specialized root systems and the presence of pseudobulbs, which are adaptations for storing water and nutrients in their native environments."
