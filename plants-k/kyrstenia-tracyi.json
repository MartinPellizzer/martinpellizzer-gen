    "intro": "Kyrstenia tracyi, commonly known as Tracy's kyrstenia, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small white or yellowish flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
