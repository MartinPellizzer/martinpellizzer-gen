    "intro": "Kardanoglyphos, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It features silver-gray foliage with a velvety texture, which helps it retain moisture in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in the evening. Its berries, which are toxic to humans and animals, are an important food source for certain bird species. Kardanoglyphos is often found growing in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
