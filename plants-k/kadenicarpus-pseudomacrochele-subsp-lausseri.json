    "intro": "Kadenicarpus pseudomacrochele subsp. lausseri, commonly known as the Lausser's kadenicarpus, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring small, palmate leaves and distinctive floral structures. The plant exhibits a herbaceous growth habit, typically found in specific microhabitats with high humidity and well-drained soil. Its flowers are usually unisexual, with separate male and female inflorescences, a trait common in some members of the Malvaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
