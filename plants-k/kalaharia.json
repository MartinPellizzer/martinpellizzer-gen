    "intro": "Kalaharia, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, waxy leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a perennial herb, often forming a rosette of leaves with a central stem that bears the blooms. Kalaharia thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its popularity as a houseplant is due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
