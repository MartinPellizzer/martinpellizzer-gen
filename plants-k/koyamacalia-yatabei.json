    "intro": "Koyamacalia yatabei, commonly known as the Yatabei's koyama, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and thrives in well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Due to habitat destruction, Koyamacalia yatabei is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
