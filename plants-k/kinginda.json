    "intro": "Kinginda, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Andes, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender petioles. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Kinginda thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, preferring sunny conditions for optimal growth."
