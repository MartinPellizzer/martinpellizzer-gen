    "intro": "Klasea flavescens subsp. cretica, commonly known as the Cretan yellow bell, is a flowering plant native to the island of Crete. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
