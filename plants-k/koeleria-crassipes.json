    "intro": "Koeleria crassipes, commonly known as the rough fescue, is a perennial grass native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are often green or pale blue in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, dry habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. Koeleria crassipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
