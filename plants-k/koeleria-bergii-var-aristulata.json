    "intro": "Koeleria bergii var. aristulata, commonly known as the Arctic grass or mountain grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It typically reaches heights of 5 to 15 centimeters and features fine, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Koeleria bergii var. aristulata is often found in tundra and rocky habitats, playing a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
