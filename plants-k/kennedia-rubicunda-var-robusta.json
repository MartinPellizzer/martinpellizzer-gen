It is characterized by its striking, red-orange, paw-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The species is also valued for its ability to attract native pollinators such as birds and insects."
