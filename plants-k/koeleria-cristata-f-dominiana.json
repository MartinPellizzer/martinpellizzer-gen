    "intro": "Koeleria cristata f. dominiana, commonly known as the dwarf sheep's beard, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the alpine regions of the Andes. It features dense, tufted clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. The plant is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. Its compact form and ornamental foliage make it a desirable addition to rock gardens and alpine displays. It is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas."
