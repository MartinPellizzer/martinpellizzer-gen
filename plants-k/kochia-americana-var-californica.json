It is an annual herb that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and thrives in full sun. The plant features feathery, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in late summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. The plant is also known for its rapid growth and ability to tolerate drought conditions."
