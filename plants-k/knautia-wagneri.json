    "intro": "Knautia wagneri, commonly known as Wagner's knautia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink or purple flower clusters that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often hairy and somewhat woody at the base. Wagner's knautia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
