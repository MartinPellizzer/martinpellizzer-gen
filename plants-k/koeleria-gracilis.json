    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis, commonly known as slender wild oat, is a perennial grass native to the Arctic and temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, meadows, and tundra. The plant has slender, hairless stems that often curl inward, and its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor soil conditions. Koeleria gracilis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
