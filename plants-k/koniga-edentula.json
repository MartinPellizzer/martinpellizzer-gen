    "intro": "Koniga edentula, commonly known as the toothless koniga, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with dark green, leathery leaves. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
