    "intro": "Koeleria macrantha var. arenicola, commonly known as the sandkoeleria, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in desert environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
