    "intro": "Koenigia hubertii, commonly known as the rock groundsel, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically arranged in a cluster at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Koenigia hubertii is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in arid environments."
