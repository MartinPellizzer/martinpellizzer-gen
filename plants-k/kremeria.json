    "intro": "Kremeria, commonly known as the \"skeleton weed,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its unique, branched stems and small, often hairy leaves. The flowers are typically yellow or orange and are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Kremeria species are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. These plants are adapted to survive in harsh environments, often with deep root systems and reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss."
