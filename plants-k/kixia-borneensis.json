It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, evergreen leaves and produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded understory environments. Due to habitat loss, Kixia borneensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
