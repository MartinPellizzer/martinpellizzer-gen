    "intro": "Kunzea villiceps, commonly known as the silky kunzea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and drought conditions. Kunzea villiceps plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
