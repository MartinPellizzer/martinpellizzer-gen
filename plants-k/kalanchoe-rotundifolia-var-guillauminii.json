    "intro": "Kalanchoe rotundifolia var. guillauminii, commonly known as the Guinea blanket or Guillianii kalanchoe, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its dense, fleshy leaves that are round and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of vibrant orange or yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in winter. It is a compact shrub that grows up to 30 cm in height, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Its botanical features make it well adapted to dry climates and low maintenance gardening."
