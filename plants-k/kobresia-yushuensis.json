    "intro": "Kobresia yushuensis, commonly known as the Yushu Kobresia, is a flowering plant native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cold, arid conditions and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Kobresia yushuensis plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat."
