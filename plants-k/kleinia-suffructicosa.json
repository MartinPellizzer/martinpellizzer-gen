    "intro": "Kleinia suffructicosa, commonly known as the rock fig or desert fig, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, storing water in its thick stems and leaves. Kleinia suffructicosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
