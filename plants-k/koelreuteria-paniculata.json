    "intro": "Koelreuteria paniculata, commonly known as the Chinese lantern tree, is a deciduous tree native to China, Korea, and Japan. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are alternate and pinnately arranged, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets. The plant produces showy, drooping panicles of yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are followed by distinctive orange-red, papery fruits that persist into winter. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Koelreuteria paniculata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
