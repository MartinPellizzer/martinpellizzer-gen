    "intro": "Kleinia angulata, commonly known as the angular kleinia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, which is known for its diverse and often ornamental flora. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, angular leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, often blooming in spring. Kleinia angulata is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its drought tolerance and aesthetic appeal."
