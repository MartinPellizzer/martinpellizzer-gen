    "intro": "Kosteletzkya thouarsiana var. humbertiana, commonly known as the Humbert's mangrove, is a variant of the mangrove species native to tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is a shrub or small tree that thrives in brackish water environments, often found in coastal areas and estuaries. The plant has thick, fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and filter water, contributing to its ecological importance. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically yellow or greenish, and the plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by water."
