    "intro": "Kixia gitingensis, commonly known as the Giting's kixia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes shrubs and evergreen plants adapted to acidic soils. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white in color, blooming in the spring. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, contributing to its ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Kixia gitingensis is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
