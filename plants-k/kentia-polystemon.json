    "intro": "Kentia polystemon, commonly known as the silver tree, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to the island of Mauritius. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage, which consists of small, narrow leaves arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by distinctive, lantern-like fruits that turn red when mature. Kentia polystemon thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. It is also valued for its ability to tolerate partial shade and its relatively slow growth rate."
