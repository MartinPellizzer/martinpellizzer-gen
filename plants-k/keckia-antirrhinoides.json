It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that resemble small bells, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Keckia antirrhinoides is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
