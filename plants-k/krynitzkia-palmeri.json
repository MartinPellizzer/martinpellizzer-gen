It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.
