    "intro": "Kochummenia terengganuensis, commonly known as the Terengganu kochummenia, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the coastal areas of Terengganu, Malaysia. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its unique morphological features, including its woody structure and specialized leaf arrangement. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained sandy soils, often growing near mangrove forests. Its conservation status is vulnerable due to habitat loss and limited distribution. Further research is needed to fully understand its ecological role and potential for conservation efforts."
