It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields."
