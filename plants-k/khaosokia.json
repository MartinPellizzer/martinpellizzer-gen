    "intro": "Khaosokia, commonly known as the sacred flame orchid, is a rare and exquisite flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fiery red and orange blossoms that resemble flames, hence its common name. The plant belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is known for its intricate, showy flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Khaosokia thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and beauty, it is highly valued in both horticulture and traditional medicine."
