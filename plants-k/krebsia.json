    "intro": "Krebsia, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of trees and shrubs. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish berries. Krebsia species typically have a hemiparasitic relationship with their host plants, drawing water and nutrients from them while performing some photosynthesis. The plant is often found in temperate regions and can be a significant ecological component in certain forest ecosystems. Its berries are sometimes consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal."
