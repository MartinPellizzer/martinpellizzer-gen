    "intro": "Keckiella antirrhinoides var. antirrhinoides, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its fibrous stems and leaves are adapted to conserve water, making it well-suited for drought conditions. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
