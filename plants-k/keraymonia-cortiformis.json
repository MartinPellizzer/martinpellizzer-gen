    "intro": "Keraymonia cortiformis, commonly known as the tree fern, is a unique plant characterized by its tall, tree-like structure with a central trunk and a crown of feathery fronds. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a rhizome that serves as its base, from which the trunk and fronds grow. Its fronds are typically large, with a pinnate structure, and they play a key role in photosynthesis. Keraymonia cortiformis is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appearance."
