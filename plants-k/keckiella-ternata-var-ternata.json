    "intro": "Keckiella ternata var. ternata, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree with woody stems and oval, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration in dry landscapes."
