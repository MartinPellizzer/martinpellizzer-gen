    "intro": "Kunzea preissiana, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves, are used in aromatherapy and traditional medicine. Kunzea preissiana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
