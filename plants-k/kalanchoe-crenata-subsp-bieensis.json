    "intro": "Kalanchoe crenata subsp. bieensis, commonly known as the Bieen's Kalanchoe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the winter months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
