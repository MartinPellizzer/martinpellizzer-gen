    "intro": "Koeleria glauca var. pohleana, commonly known as the Pohlean bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue or purple flowers in early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, and is drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate appearance and ability to form dense, attractive mats."
