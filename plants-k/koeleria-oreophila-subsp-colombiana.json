    "intro": "Koeleria oreophila subsp. colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian mountain grass, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas and for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
