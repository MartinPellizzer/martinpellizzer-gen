    "intro": "Kyrstenia paupercula, commonly known as the poorflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa. It is characterized by its small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
