    "intro": "Kobresia pseuduncinoides, commonly known as the Tibetan feather grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and other parts of Central Asia. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Kobresia pseuduncinoides plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems and is an important component of high-altitude vegetation."
