It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist habitats, often forming dense stands. The plant has grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. Kyllinga albiceps is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
