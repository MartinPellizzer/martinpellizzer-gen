    "intro": "Knautia arvensis subsp. sylvatica, commonly known as the woodland knautia, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe. It typically grows in woodland edges and meadows, preferring moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flower heads that resemble daisies, consisting of numerous small florets. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators in natural habitats."
