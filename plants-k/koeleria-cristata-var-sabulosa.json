    "intro": "Koeleria cristata var. sabulosa, commonly known as the sandberg's sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects. It is often found in coastal dunes, sandy plains, and other xeric habitats."
