    "intro": "Kyllinga tenuissima, commonly known as slender spikegrass, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, followed by tiny, three-lobed seeds. Kyllinga tenuissima thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate wet conditions make it a common sight in swampy environments."
