    "intro": "Kyllinga hyalina, commonly known as the glassy spikerush, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and spikes of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its stems are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Kyllinga hyalina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
