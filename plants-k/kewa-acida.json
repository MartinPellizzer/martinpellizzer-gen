    "intro": "Kewa acida, commonly known as the sour kewa, is a unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, acidic berries that are used in traditional medicine by local communities. The plant has a dense, shrub-like structure with dark green, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and they bloom in clusters during the dry season. The botanical significance of Kewa acida lies in its potential medicinal properties and its role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
