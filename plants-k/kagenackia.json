It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, broad leaves, and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink.

These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and have been studied for their potential ecological and medicinal uses."
