It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has adapted to harsh environments with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with multiple branches and a compact form. Kaokochloa plays an important ecological role in supporting pollinators and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
