    "intro": "Keraudrenia integrifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved keraudrenia, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its simple, entire leaves and small, clustered white flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments within the island's humid forests. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
