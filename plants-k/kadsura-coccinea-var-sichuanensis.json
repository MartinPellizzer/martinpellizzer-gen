    "intro": "Kadsura coccinea var. sichuanensis, commonly known as the Sichuan red kadsura, is a species of flowering plant in the Aristolochiaceae family. It is native to China, particularly in the Sichuan province, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its striking red and purple flowers, which are often mistaken for berries due to their appearance. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while the stems are woody and somewhat vine-like. This variant is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though its use is limited due to its toxicity."
