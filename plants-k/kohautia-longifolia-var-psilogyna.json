    "intro": "Kohautia longifolia var. psilogyna, commonly known as the longleaf kohautia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are elongated and often have a distinctive, finely divided structure, while its flowers are small and clustered in umbels. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving its natural habitat."
