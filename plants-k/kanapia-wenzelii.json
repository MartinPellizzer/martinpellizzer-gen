    "intro": "Kanapia wenzelii, commonly known as the Wenzel's kanapia, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many flowering plants known for their ornamental and medicinal value. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are usually opposite and elliptical, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Kanapia wenzelii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
