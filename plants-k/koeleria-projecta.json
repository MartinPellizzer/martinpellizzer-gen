    "intro": "Koeleria projecta, commonly known as the plains grass or sand dropseed, is a low-growing perennial grass native to North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and is characterized by its slender, blue-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in prairie and steppe habitats. Koeleria projecta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
