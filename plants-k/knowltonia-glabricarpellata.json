    "intro": "Knowltonia glabricarpellata, commonly known as the smooth-carpel knowltonia, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a distinctive, sprawling growth habit with hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it faces significant threats to its survival."
