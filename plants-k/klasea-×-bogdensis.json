    "intro": "Klasea \u00d7 bogdensis, commonly known as the hybrid bog lichen, is a composite organism formed through the union of two distinct lichen species. It consists of a fungal partner, typically a member of the Ascomycota, and a photobiont, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. The plant exhibits a thallus structure that is often crustose or foliose, depending on environmental conditions. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, commonly found in forested areas with high humidity. Due to its unique composition, it plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its habitat."
