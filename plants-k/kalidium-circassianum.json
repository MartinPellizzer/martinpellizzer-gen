    "intro": "Kalidium circassianum, commonly known as the Circassian grass, is a flowering plant native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as steppes and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
