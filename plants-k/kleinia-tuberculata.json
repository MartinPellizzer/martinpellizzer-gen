    "intro": "Kleinia tuberculata, commonly known as the rock fig or tubercled kleinia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in small, raised tubercles. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or arid environments. Kleinia tuberculata is often used in rock gardens and as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
