    "intro": "Kyllinga tuberosa, commonly known as arrowhead plant or tuberous arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features erect, grass-like stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by tuberous roots that serve as storage organs. Kyllinga tuberosa thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed in aquatic environments."
