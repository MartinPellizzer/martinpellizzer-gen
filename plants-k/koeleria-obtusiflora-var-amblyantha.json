It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, bluish-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine or arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
