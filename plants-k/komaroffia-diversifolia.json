    "intro": "Komaroffia diversifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved mountain pine, is a species of conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, flat needles and cones that hang downward, distinguishing it from other pine species. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Its botanical features include a tall, slender trunk and a conical shape, typical of many pine species. The leaves are arranged in spirals along the stems, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
