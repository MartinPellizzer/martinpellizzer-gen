It is a low-growing perennial with slender, branching stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water conservation. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Its ecological importance includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a component of native plant communities in its habitat."
