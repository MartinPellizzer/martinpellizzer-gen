    "intro": "Kniphofia breviflora, commonly known as the red hot poker, is a striking perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spike-like inflorescences that bear bright red, orange, or yellow tubular flowers, which are particularly showy in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense clump, and it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Kniphofia breviflora is also valued for its resilience and low maintenance requirements in suitable climates."
