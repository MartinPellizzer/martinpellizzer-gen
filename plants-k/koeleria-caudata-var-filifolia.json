    "intro": "Koeleria caudata var. filifolia, commonly known as the silky wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It features slender, grass-like leaves with a fine, silky texture, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged along a central axis. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and ability to thrive in poor soils. Its botanical structure makes it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and as a component of native plant communities."
