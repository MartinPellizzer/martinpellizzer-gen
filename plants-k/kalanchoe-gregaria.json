    "intro": "Kalanchoe gregaria, commonly known as the rock garden kalanchoe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in late winter or early spring. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Kalanchoe gregaria is also known for its ability to propagate easily through offsets, which can be separated and planted to grow new plants."
