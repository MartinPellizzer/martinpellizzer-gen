    "intro": "Kickxia dibolophylla, commonly known as the two-leafed rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops and wildflowers. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
