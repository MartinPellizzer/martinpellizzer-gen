    "intro": "Kyllinga odorata var. genuina, commonly known as the sweet sedge, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often forming dense stands in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with white or pale pink flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common colonizer of disturbed wet soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in water gardens or as a ground cover in moist landscapes."
