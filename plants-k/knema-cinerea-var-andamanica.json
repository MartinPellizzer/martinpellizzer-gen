    "intro": "Knema cinerea var. andamanica, commonly known as the Andaman white ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Andaman Islands. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forests. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically used for construction and tool-making in indigenous communities."
