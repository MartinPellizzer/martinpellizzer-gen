    "intro": "Kyllinga peruviana var. foliata, commonly known as the broadleaf kyllinga, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It features upright, branching stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds."
