    "intro": "Keraudrenia velutina, commonly known as the velvet keraudrenia, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many flowering plants known for their ornamental value. The plant is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Keraudrenia velutina is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
