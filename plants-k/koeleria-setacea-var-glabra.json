    "intro": "Koeleria setacea var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features slender, hairless stems that are often prostrate or decumbent, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically glabrous. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences, which bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in sandy or rocky soils. This variety is often used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in drought-tolerant landscapes."
