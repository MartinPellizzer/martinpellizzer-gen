    "intro": "Kentia subglobosa, commonly known as the globe kentia, is a species of cycad native to New Caledonia. It is characterized by its short, stout trunk and large, feathery leaves that grow in a dense rosette. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in humid, well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
