    "intro": "Katherinea kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Bornean star orchid, is a rare and endemic flowering plant found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and is typically found in cloud forests. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered a vulnerable species."
