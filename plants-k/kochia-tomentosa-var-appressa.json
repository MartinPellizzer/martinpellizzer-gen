    "intro": "Kochia tomentosa var. appressa, commonly known as the woolly kochia, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, fuzzy foliage that gives it a distinctive, mat-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spiky inflorescences. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soils. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
