It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, showy yellow flowers and hairy foliage. The subspecies is distinguished by the presence of glandular structures on its stems and leaves, which secrete oils. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that release seeds through mechanical means when mature."
