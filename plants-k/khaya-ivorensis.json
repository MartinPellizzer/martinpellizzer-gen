    "intro": "Khaya ivorensis, commonly known as African shea tree, is a deciduous tree native to western and central Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. These seeds are the source of shea butter, a valuable natural product used in cosmetics and food industries. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in savanna and woodland areas."
