    "intro": "Kraunhia megasperma, commonly known as the broad-leaved kraunhia, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowering period occurs during the warmer months, and it is often used in gardens for its ornamental value. Kraunhia megasperma is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid regions."
