    "intro": "Koeleria gintlii, commonly known as the Tibetan feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high altitudes of Tibet and adjacent regions. It features slender, wiry stems and produces delicate, feathery inflorescences that are often blue or purple in color. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to poor soil conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive blue-green hue. Koeleria gintlii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
