    "intro": "Koeleria carolii, commonly known as Carol's needlegrass, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators. Koeleria carolii is also used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in poor conditions."
