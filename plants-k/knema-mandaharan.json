    "intro": "Knema mandaharan, commonly known as the Malay knema, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forest areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
