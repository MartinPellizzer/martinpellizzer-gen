    "intro": "Koeleria condensata, commonly known as blue grass or prairie grass, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple florets, giving it its common name. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes, and is often found in association with other native grasses. Koeleria condensata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
