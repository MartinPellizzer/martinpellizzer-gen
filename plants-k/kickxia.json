It consists of about 20 species, most of which are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal leaves that are grass-like in appearance, and they produce showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, or orange. Kickxia species are often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. They are generally herbaceous perennials with a fibrous root system."
