    "intro": "Koeleria riguorum, commonly known as the rigid goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and is often found in dry, nutrient-poor soils. Koeleria riguorum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
