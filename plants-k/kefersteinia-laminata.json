    "intro": "Kefersteinia laminata, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, translucent, and often colorful bracts that resemble petals, though it does not produce true flowers. The plant is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage is typically broad and strap-like, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Due to its rarity and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
