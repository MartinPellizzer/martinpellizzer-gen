    "intro": "Koeleria compacta, commonly known as bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny blue to purple flowers. This plant is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in prairies, meadows, and disturbed areas. Koeleria compacta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects. Its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in full sun make it a resilient choice for landscaping."
