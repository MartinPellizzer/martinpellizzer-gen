It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight bluish or grayish hue. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found near streams, ditches, and wet meadows."
