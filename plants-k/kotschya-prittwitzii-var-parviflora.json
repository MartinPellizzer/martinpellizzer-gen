    "intro": "Kotschya prittwitzii var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered kotschya, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern India. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a subtle beauty to its foliage. It thrives in cool, humid conditions and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a rare species of ecological and botanical interest."
