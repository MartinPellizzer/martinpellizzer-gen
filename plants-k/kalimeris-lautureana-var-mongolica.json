    "intro": "Kalimeris lautureana var. mongolica, commonly known as Mongolian goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the grasslands of Mongolia and northern China. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow to golden-orange composite flowers that bloom from late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and often grayish-green due to a dense layer of fine hairs. This species is adapted to dry, temperate climates and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
