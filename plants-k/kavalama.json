    "intro": "Kavalama, commonly known as the \"wild ginger\" or \"kava plant,\" is a tropical shrub native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, rhizomatous root system. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy underneath. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, and the plant produces red or yellow berries that contain seeds. The rhizomes are the primary part used, containing compounds that have been traditionally used for their medicinal and ceremonial properties."
