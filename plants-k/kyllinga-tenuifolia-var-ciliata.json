    "intro": "Kyllinga tenuifolia var. ciliata, commonly known as slender spikegrass, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and disturbed areas. Botanically, it is classified within the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants."
