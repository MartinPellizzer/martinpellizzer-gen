    "intro": "Kalanchoe alticola, commonly known as the rock kalanchoe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of bright orange or yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Kalanchoe alticola is drought-tolerant and requires minimal care once established."
