    "intro": "Kali basalticum, commonly known as the basaltic saltbush, is a hardy shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. Kali basalticum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in poor conditions."
