    "intro": "Kadenia, commonly known as the \"desert rose,\" is a genus of succulent plants native to southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their fleshy, water-storing stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors. Kadenia species are typically low-growing and thrive in well-draining soil with minimal water. They are popular in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value. The genus includes several species, such as Kadenia hirta and Kadenia moelleri, which are often cultivated for their unique appearance."
