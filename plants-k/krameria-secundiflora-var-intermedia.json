    "intro": "Krameria secundiflora var. intermedia, commonly known as the Mexican candle bush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, branched structure and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. The species is notable for its ability to produce a milky sap, which can be toxic to some animals."
