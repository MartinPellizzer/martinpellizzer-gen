    "intro": "Krameria lanceolata, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, hot climates. The plant produces yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Krameria lanceolata is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance."
