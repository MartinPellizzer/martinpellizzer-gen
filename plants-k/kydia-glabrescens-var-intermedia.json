    "intro": "Kydia glabrescens var. intermedia, commonly known as the woolly knotweed, is a shrub native to the arid regions of central Asia. It features wiry, ascending stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or reddish in color, followed by small, round fruits. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with poor soil conditions. Its hairy leaves and stems provide insulation against extreme temperatures, making it well-suited for its native habitat."
