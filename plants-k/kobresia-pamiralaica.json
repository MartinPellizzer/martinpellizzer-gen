    "intro": "Kobresia pamiralaica, commonly known as the Pamir hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia, particularly the Pamir Mountains. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and strong winds. The plant has a dense, mat-like growth habit, with fine, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its harsh habitat. Kobresia pamiralaica is also valued for its use in traditional pastoral practices in the region."
