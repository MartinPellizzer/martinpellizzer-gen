    "intro": "Kosteletzkya adoensis var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy marsh mallow, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its herbaceous, semi-aquatic growth habit and its ability to thrive in wet or marshy environments. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. Its showy, pinkish-white flowers are borne in clusters and bloom during the wet season. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes other plants with similar morphological traits."
