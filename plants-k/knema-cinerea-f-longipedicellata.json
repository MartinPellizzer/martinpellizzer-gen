    "intro": "Knema cinerea f. longipedicellata, commonly known as the long-fruited knema, is a rare botanical variant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by elongated, woody capsules as its fruit. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
