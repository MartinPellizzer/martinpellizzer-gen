    "intro": "Krapovickasia, commonly known as the genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae, consists of several species native to Central Asia. These plants are characterized by their umbellate inflorescences and often have finely divided, aromatic leaves. Krapovickasia species are typically herbaceous, with some exhibiting a semi-woody stem. They are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. The genus is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in their native regions."
