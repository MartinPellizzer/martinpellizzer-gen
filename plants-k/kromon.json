    "intro": "Kromon, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive red bark and its ability to thrive in brackish water environments. The plant has specialized root systems that help it anchor in soft, waterlogged soils and facilitate gas exchange. Its leaves are typically small, ovate, and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Kromon plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
