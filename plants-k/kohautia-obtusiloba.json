It is a perennial herb native to New Zealand, typically found in rocky or alpine environments. The plant has finely divided, bluish-green leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. Its small, white flowers bloom in summer, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Kohautia obtusiloba is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
