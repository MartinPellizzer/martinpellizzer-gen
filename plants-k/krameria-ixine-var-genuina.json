    "intro": "Krameria ixine var. genuina, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 feet, featuring dense clusters of small, spiny leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its succulent stems and leaves are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Krameria ixine var. genuina is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
