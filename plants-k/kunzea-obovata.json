    "intro": "Kunzea obovata, commonly known as the broad-leaved kunzea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features aromatic, narrow to broad elliptic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Kunzea obovata is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
