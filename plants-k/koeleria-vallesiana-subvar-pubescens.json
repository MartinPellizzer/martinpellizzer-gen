    "intro": "Koeleria vallesiana subvar. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent valley grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its leaves are covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance and contributing to its common name. This species is adapted to cold, arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine and subalpine habitats."
