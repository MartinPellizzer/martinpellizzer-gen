    "intro": "Koeleria cristata subsp. splendens, commonly known as the golden tufted grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and bright golden to reddish inflorescence, which adds ornamental value to its appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and it produces small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
