    "intro": "Kaempfera, commonly known as the \"screw vine,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of approximately 100 species, predominantly found in tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees with opposite, often simple or trifoliate leaves. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually white or yellow, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Many species of Kaempfera are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
