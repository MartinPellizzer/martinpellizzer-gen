    "intro": "Kuhnia icosantha, commonly known as the common marsh thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of broad, silver-white, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its moist habitat. The plant produces tall, erect stems bearing yellow flowers arranged in a cylindrical inflorescence. It has a fibrous root system that anchors it in waterlogged soils and aids in nutrient absorption. Kuhnia icosantha plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
