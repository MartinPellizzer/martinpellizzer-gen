    "intro": "Kobresia kanaii, commonly known as the Kanai's feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It forms dense, mat-like colonies and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs, giving it a soft, feathery appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer, which are arranged in spikes. Kobresia kanaii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its harsh, mountainous environment."
