    "intro": "Krascheninikovia ciliata, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late summer. It has hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. Krascheninikovia ciliata is adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient species in polar and alpine ecosystems."
