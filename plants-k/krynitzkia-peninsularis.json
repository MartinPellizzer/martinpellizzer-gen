    "intro": "Krynitzkia peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular krynitzkia, is a rare succulent native to the Mediterranean region. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its arid environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
