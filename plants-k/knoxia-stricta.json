    "intro": "Knoxia stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf knoxia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of red, pink, and purple, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Knoxia stricta is often found in rocky soils and dry habitats, making it well adapted to arid environments. It is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
