    "intro": "Kotschya micrantha, commonly known as the Indian snow lotus, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It is a perennial herb that thrives in high-altitude environments, typically above 3,000 meters. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid conditions. Kotschya micrantha is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional Ayurvedic practices."
