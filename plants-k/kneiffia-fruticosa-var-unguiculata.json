    "intro": "Kneiffia fruticosa var. unguiculata, commonly known as the red-flowered rock rose, is a shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of bright red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal and arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, while its stems are woody and often covered in a fine, powdery coating. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
