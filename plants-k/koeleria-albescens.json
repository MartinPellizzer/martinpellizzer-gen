    "intro": "Koeleria albescens, commonly known as the white feather grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-white foliage that gives it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Koeleria albescens is adapted to drought conditions and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low water requirements."
