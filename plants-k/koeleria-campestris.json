    "intro": "Koeleria campestris, commonly known as the field feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and fine, feather-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically pale blue or greenish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, meadows, and along roadsides. Koeleria campestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
