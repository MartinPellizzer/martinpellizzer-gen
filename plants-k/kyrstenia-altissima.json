    "intro": "Kyrstenia altissima, commonly known as the tall kyrstenia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale blue or purple in color, blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Kyrstenia altissima is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
