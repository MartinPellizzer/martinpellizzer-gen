    "intro": "Knorringia sibirica subsp. ubsunurica, commonly known as the Ubsunur Meadow Bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the cold regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple. It blooms in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
