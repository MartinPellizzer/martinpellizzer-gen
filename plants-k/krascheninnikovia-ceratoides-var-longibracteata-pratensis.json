    "intro": "[WRONG START] Krascheninninnikovia ceratoides var. longibracteata-pratensis, commonly known as the sand couch grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features dense, mat-forming growth with narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. This variety is particularly noted for its resilience and ability to stabilize sandy soils, making it ecologically significant in its native habitat."
