    "intro": "Kohleria stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved kohleria, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Kohleria stricta is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its vibrant blooms and compact size."
