    "intro": "Koeleria preslii, commonly known as the Preslii grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and intense sunlight. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils. Koeleria preslii plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat."
