    "intro": "Kohleria petiolaris, commonly known as the velvet leaf, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with intricate patterns. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Kohleria petiolaris thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
