    "intro": "Krameria linifolia, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that produces small, yellow, tubular flowers, which are adapted for pollination by insects. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in sandy soils. Krameria linifolia is well-suited to xerophytic conditions and plays a role in stabilizing desert ecosystems."
