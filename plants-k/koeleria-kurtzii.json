It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of pale blue to purple flowers. Koeleria kurtzii is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in cooler, high-altitude environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insect species."
