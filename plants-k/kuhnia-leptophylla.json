    "intro": "Kuhnia leptophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh fern, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or boggy areas. Its fronds are usually clustered at the base, forming a rosette structure that helps retain moisture. Kuhnia leptophylla plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stabilization and providing shelter for small aquatic organisms."
