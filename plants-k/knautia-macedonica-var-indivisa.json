    "intro": "Knautia macedonica var. indivisa, commonly known as the Macedonian knautia, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its clusters of pink to purple, fluffy flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are upright and branched. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged blooming period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
