    "intro": "Krynitzkia cedrosensis, commonly known as the Cedros Island cholla, is a succulent cactus native to the deserts of Cedros Island in Baja California, Mexico. It features a cylindrical stem covered in spiny, tuberculate structures that help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are pollinated by insects. It is adapted to arid environments with well-drained soils and minimal rainfall. Krynitzkia cedrosensis plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for local wildlife."
