    "intro": "Kirilowia eriantha, commonly known as the white-flowered bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, with a distinctive tubular shape. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native habitat."
