    "intro": "Kniphofia linearifolia var. montana, commonly known as the mountain torch lily, is a striking perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features tall, upright stems that bear dense clusters of bright red to orange-red flowers, resembling torches. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are linear and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which typically occurs in late summer to early autumn."
