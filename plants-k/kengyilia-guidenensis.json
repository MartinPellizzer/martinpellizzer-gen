    "intro": "Kengyilia guidenensis, commonly known as the Guiden's fleur-de-lis, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a low-growing, herbaceous structure with narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its showy, yellow flowers are arranged in a radiate pattern, typical of the family, and bloom during the summer months. Kengyilia guidenensis is adapted to harsh, dry environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
