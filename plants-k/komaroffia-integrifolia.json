    "intro": "Komaroffia integrifolia, commonly known as the Pacific madrone, is a deciduous tree native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are entire and glossy green on top, with a pale underside. It produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries that are an important food source for wildlife. The species is adapted to coastal climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils."
