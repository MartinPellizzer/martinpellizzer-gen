    "intro": "Klossia, commonly known as the Kloss's orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia. These plants are characterized by their delicate, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple. Klossia species typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks in their natural habitats. Their botanical significance lies in their unique floral structures and their role in the biodiversity of tropical ecosystems."
