    "intro": "Koenigia lapathifolia var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth leaf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to rocky and arid environments. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green, adapted to store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, often in late spring or early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it an attractive choice for gardeners seeking easy-to-maintain plants."
