It features dense clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink to red in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that remain on the shrub throughout the year, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its compact form and vibrant floral display make it a popular choice for native plant landscaping."
