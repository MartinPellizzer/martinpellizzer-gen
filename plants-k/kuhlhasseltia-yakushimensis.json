It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with four-petaled flowers. The plant is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces small, bright yellow flowers during the spring season. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
