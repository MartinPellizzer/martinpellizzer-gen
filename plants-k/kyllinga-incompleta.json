    "intro": "Kyllinga incompleta, commonly known as the dwarf spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of white or pale pink flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable habitats. Kyllinga incompleta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
