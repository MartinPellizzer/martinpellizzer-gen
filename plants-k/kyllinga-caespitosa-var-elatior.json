    "intro": "Kyllinga caespitosa var. elatior, commonly known as the tufted spikerush, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It forms dense, grass-like clumps with slender, erect stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the base. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate spikes, a characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. Kyllinga caespitosa var. elatior thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
