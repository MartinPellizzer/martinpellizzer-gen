    "intro": "Krascheninnikovia lanata var. ruinina, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its fibrous root system enables it to thrive in sandy soils and withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion."
