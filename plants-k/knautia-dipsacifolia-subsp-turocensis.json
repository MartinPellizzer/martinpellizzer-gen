    "intro": "Knautia dipsacifolia subsp. turocensis, commonly known as the Turocian knautia, is a flowering plant native to the Carpathian region. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pink to purple flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and narrower leaves compared to the typical form of *K. dipsacifolia*. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often found in meadows and slopes at high elevations. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to its mountainous habitat."
