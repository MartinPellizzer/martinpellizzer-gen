It is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pink. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it an attractive and low-maintenance plant for gardeners in dry climates."
