    "intro": "Koeleria carniolica, commonly known as the Carpathian grass or Carpathian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in open, dry habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Koeleria carniolica is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
