    "intro": "Kallstroemia pubescens, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name \"pubescens,\" meaning \"hairy.\" It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Kallstroemia pubescens is adapted to hot, dry climates and is a valuable plant for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
