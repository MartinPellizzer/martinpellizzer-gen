    "intro": "Koeleria tenella, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically reaches a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters and has fine, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in dense spikes, which are arranged in panicles. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Koeleria tenella is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or marginal areas."
