    "intro": "Koeleria cristata var. grandiflora, commonly known as the tufted grass or snow grass, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Koeleria cristata var. grandiflora is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value in cooler regions."
