    "intro": "Kobresia bonatiana, commonly known as the Bonati's kobresia, is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in high-altitude environments. It is native to regions of the Himalayas and is adapted to cold, arid conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense mats, which help it retain moisture in harsh climates. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil in alpine and arctic ecosystems. Its flowering stems are short and often bear small, inconspicuous flowers."
