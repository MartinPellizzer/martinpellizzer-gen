    "intro": "Koeleria phleoides var. integrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf tufted grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are smooth and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of native plant communities and a candidate for ecological restoration projects."
