    "intro": "Koniga nummularia, commonly known as the silver dollar plant, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features small, round, silver-gray leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a compact and decorative appearance. The plant produces tiny, white, star-shaped flowers in late spring, which are followed by small, round, blue-black berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense mats make it ideal for erosion control in suitable climates."
