    "intro": "Kokoschkinia, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall, invasive plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, umbrella-shaped leaves and clusters of white flowers, which can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant contains phototoxic sap that can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. It is often found near waterways and in disturbed soils, spreading rapidly through its extensive root system. Due to its harmful effects, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
