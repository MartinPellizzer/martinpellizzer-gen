    "intro": "Kohautia cicendioides, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the forests of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Kohautia cicendioides is considered a vulnerable species."
