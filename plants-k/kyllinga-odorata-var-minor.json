    "intro": "Kyllinga odorata var. minor, commonly known as sweet sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of white or pale pink flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Kyllinga odorata var. minor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in aquatic gardens or as a ground cover."
