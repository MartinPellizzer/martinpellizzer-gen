    "intro": "Koeleria caucasica subsp. fominii, commonly known as the Caucasian feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces delicate, feathery inflorescences that resemble plumes. The plant typically grows in open, sandy or rocky habitats, often in alpine or steppe environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical form of Koeleria caucasica."
