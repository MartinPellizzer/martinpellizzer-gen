    "intro": "Kiggelaria grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved kiggelaria, is a tropical shrub native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by orange-red berries containing several seeds. Kiggelaria grandifolia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
