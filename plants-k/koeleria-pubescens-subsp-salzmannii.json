    "intro": "Koeleria pubescens subsp. salzmannii, commonly known as the Salzmann's bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny blue to purple flowers. The plant is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It is often found in open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. Due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
