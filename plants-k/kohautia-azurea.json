    "intro": "Kohautia azurea, commonly known as the blue kohautia, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically blue or purple in color, giving it its common name. Kohautia azurea is often found in wetlands and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
