    "intro": "Kuhnistera tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender-leaf kuhnistera, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Kuhnistera tenuifolia is often found in tropical rainforests and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
