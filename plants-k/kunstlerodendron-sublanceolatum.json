    "intro": "Kunstlerodendron sublanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-lanceleaf kunstlerodendron, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
