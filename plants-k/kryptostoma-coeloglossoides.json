    "intro": "Kryptostoma coeloglossoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf waterwheel, is a perennial aquatic plant native to South America. It features long, narrow leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the substrate. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense, wheel-like inflorescences. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for ornamental water gardens."
