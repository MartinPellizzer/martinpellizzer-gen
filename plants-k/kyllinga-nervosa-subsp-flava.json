    "intro": "Kyllinga nervosa subsp. flava, commonly known as yellow spikegrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist, well-drained soils. The plant has slender, upright stems that bear small, clustered spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight sheen, and the inflorescence consists of yellow to reddish-brown flowers. Kyllinga nervosa subsp. flava is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
