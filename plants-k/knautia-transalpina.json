    "intro": "Knautia transalpina, commonly known as the Transalpine knautia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a member of the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flower heads that resemble small umbels. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, often found in alpine meadows and slopes. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Knautia transalpina is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
