    "intro": "Kochia scoparia var. subvillosa, commonly known as tumbleweed, is a flowering plant native to Eurasia and North America. It is characterized by its fluffy, spherical seed heads that detach easily from the plant, aiding in seed dispersal. The plant has a bushy, upright growth habit with pale green, lobed leaves that become more hairy as the plant matures. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found along roadsides and in disturbed soils. Its rapid growth and drought tolerance make it an invasive species in many regions."
