    "intro": "Kyllinga brevifolia f. laxa, commonly known as the laxa form of dwarf spikerush, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, with a dense, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale pink flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. Its botanical structure makes it an attractive addition to water gardens and wetland restoration projects."
