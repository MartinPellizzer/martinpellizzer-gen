    "intro": "Keckiella antirrhinoides var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved keckiella, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often on rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its small, hairy leaves and upright growth habit are features that help it conserve water and reduce heat stress. The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in supporting local pollinators and its resilience in harsh climates."
