    "intro": "Kyllinga odorata var. major, commonly known as sweet sedge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purple in color. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of white or pale pink flowers, which are borne on short, upright stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate wet conditions, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
