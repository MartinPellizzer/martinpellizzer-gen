    "intro": "Kyllinga odorata var. elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed fragrant spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features erect, slender stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often with a reddish hue. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface, and the plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and subtle fragrance."
