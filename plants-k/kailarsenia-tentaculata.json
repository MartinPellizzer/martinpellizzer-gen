It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that bear small, hair-like structures called tentacles. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to flourish. Its reproductive structures are typically found on the underside of its fronds, producing spores for propagation. Botanically, it belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
