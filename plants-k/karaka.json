    "intro": "Karaka, commonly known as *Corynocarpus laevigatus*, is a deciduous tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its smooth, grey-barked trunk and oval-shaped leaves that turn a striking red or orange in autumn. The tree produces small, yellow flowers followed by orange or red berries that contain toxic seeds. Karaka thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Its unique appearance and seasonal color changes make it a distinctive feature in New Zealand's native forests."
