    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis var. missouriana, commonly known as Missouri bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the central United States. It typically forms dense, compact tufts with narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous slender, blue-gray flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as prairies and meadows. Due to its drought tolerance and fine texture, it is a valuable component of native grasslands and restoration projects."
