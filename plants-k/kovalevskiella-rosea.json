    "intro": "Kovalevskiella rosea, commonly known as the rose-like kovalevskiella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its unique morphology and restricted range make it an interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
