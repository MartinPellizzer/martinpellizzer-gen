It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers, which bloom in early summer, are white or pale green and attract various pollinators.
