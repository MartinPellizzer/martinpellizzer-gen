    "intro": "Knautia timeroyi var. lucidifolia, commonly known as the glabrous knautia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, pink to purple flower heads that resemble those of thistles. The leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This variant is distinguished by its smooth, hairless foliage, setting it apart from other varieties in the species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly environments."
