    "intro": "Kniphofia insignis var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered red hot poker, is a striking perennial plant native to South Africa. It features tall, upright stems that bear dense clusters of tubular, white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
