    "intro": "Kobresia hookeri, commonly known as the Tibetan feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing tufts of fine, silver-white to gray-green foliage, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in harsh, cold environments and is adapted to low nutrient soils, making it a resilient species in alpine ecosystems. Kobresia hookeri plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat. Its unique morphology and ecological importance make it an important component of high-altitude vegetation."
