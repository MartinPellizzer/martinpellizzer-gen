It features showy, daisy-like flowers with vibrant yellow centers surrounded by white petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with silvery-gray foliage that helps reflect sunlight in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.
