    "intro": "Kneiffia floribunda, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of violet or purple flowers that bloom throughout the year under suitable conditions. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Kneiffia floribunda is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
