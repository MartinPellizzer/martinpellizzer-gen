    "intro": "Koeleria idahoensis var. pseudocristatoides, commonly known as the Idaho hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers, typical of the genus Koeleria. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes, often in regions with low precipitation. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in its range."
