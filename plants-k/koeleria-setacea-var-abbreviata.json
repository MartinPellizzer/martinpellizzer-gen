    "intro": "Koeleria setacea var. abbreviata, commonly known as the short-bracted feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple spikelets that are clustered at the ends of the stems. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil and limited water environments. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
