It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Koanophyllon consanguineum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife in its native range."
