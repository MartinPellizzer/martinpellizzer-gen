    "intro": "Kimnachia, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It consists of two species, both native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are shrubs or subshrubs characterized by their upright growth habit and showy, bell-shaped flowers. They have small, ovate leaves with a hairy texture and are adapted to arid environments. Kimnachia species are often found in rocky soils and are well-suited for xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance."
