    "intro": "Kruhsea tilingiana, commonly known as the Tilingian kruhsea, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant's leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
