    "intro": "Kadalia antennina, commonly known as the slender ghost orchid, is an epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and produces small, fleshy roots that help it absorb moisture from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Kadalia antennina is considered a conservation concern."
