    "intro": "Kuruna wightiana var. hispida, commonly known as the rough kuruna, is a flowering plant native to the western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
