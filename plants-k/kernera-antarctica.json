    "intro": "Kernera antarctica, commonly known as the Antarctic knotweed, is a flowering plant native to the cold environments of southern South America. It is a perennial herb that grows in rocky and alpine regions, typically at high altitudes. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Kernera antarctica is adapted to survive in extreme climates with low temperatures and strong winds."
