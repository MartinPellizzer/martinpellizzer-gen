    "intro": "Kobresia longearistita, commonly known as the Tibetan grass, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Kobresia longearistita plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine species."
