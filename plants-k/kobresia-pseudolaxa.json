    "intro": "Kobresia pseudolaxa, commonly known as the Tibetan feather grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Asia, particularly in Tibet and Nepal. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, silky leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Kobresia pseudolaxa thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
