    "intro": "Koanophyllon constanzae, commonly known as the Constanza's leafless shrub, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and lack of leaves. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and minimal foliage. Its conservation status is threatened due to habitat loss and limited distribution. Koanophyllon constanzae plays a unique role in its ecosystem, supporting specific pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its native region."
