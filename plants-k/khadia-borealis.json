    "intro": "Khadia borealis, commonly known as the northern khadia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Arctic tundra. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss and protect against frost. Khadia borealis plays a vital role in the tundra ecosystem, providing food for herbivorous insects and contributing to the region's biodiversity."
