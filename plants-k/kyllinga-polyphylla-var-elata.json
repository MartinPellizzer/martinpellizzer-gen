    "intro": "Kyllinga polyphylla var. elata, commonly known as the tall swamp kale, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its upright, herbaceous stems and broad, waxy leaves that are often variegated with purple or red hues. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, followed by three-lobed, triangular seed capsules. It thrives in wet, marshy environments and is often found in disturbed soils near water bodies. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking foliage, making it a popular choice for water gardens and wetland restoration projects."
