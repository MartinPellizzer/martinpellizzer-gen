    "intro": "Kobresia prainii var. elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic kobresia, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Tibetan Plateau and other high-altitude regions of Asia. It forms dense mats of fine, silver-green foliage, adapted to the harsh, cold, and arid conditions of its environment. The plant has narrow, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typical of the Poaceae family. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in alpine and semi-arid regions."
