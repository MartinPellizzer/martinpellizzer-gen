    "intro": "Kokkia speciosa, commonly known as the beautiful liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It is a small, leafy liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid body, which is a flat, ribbon-like structure covered in small, green lobes. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes. Kokkia speciosa plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for various microorganisms in its ecosystem."
