    "intro": "Katinasia cabrerae, commonly known as the Cabrera's katinasia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, large, and showy flowers that typically bloom in vibrant shades of red or orange. The plant has a compact growth habit with thick, fleshy leaves adapted to store water, indicating its preference for arid or semi-arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
