    "intro": "Klarobelia cauliflora, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, orchid-like flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems, a feature known as cauliflory. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity. Its flowers are typically white or pale purple, and they emit a subtle fragrance to attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Klarobelia cauliflora is considered a vulnerable species."
