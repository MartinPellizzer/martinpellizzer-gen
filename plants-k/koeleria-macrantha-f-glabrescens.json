    "intro": "Koeleria macrantha f. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous wild oat, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are generally hairless, giving it its \"glabrescens\" designation. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
