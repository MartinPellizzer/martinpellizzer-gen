    "intro": "Kuhnia arguta, commonly known as the slender marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairless. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, greenish flowers that are wind-pollinated. Kuhnia arguta is adapted to saturated soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Its rhizomes help in nutrient cycling and provide habitat for various microorganisms."
