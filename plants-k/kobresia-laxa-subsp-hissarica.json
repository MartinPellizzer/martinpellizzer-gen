    "intro": "Kobresia laxa subsp. hissarica, commonly known as the Central Asian feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. This species is well adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in rocky and barren areas. Kobresia laxa subsp. hissarica plays an important ecological role in preventing erosion and providing habitat for small animals and insects."
