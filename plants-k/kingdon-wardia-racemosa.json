    "intro": "Kingdon-wardia racemosa, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a striking flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Its unique morphology and vibrant blooms make it a prized species among orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
