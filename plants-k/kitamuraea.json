    "intro": "Kitamuraea, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that display a striking contrast of bright yellow and green. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique appearance makes it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and private collections. Due to its limited natural habitat and slow growth rate, it is considered a conservation concern."
