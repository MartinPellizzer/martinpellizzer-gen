    "intro": "Koeleria pyramidata subsp. eriostachya, commonly known as the Sierra grass or Sierra bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green foliage. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
