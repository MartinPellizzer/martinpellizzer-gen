    "intro": "Kyllingiella ugandensis, commonly known as the Ugandan star moss, is a rare and unique moss species native to the mountainous regions of Uganda. It belongs to the family Dicranaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form. The plant exhibits a delicate, star-shaped arrangement of its leaves, which are typically narrow and slightly curled. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in shaded forest floors. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Kyllingiella ugandensis is considered an important indicator species for montane ecosystems."
