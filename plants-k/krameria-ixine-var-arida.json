    "intro": "Krameria ixine var. arida, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically small, fleshy, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Krameria ixine var. arida is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in harsh environments."
