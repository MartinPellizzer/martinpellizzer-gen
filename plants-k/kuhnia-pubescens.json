    "intro": "Kuhnia pubescens, commonly known as the hairy marsh fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil while absorbing nutrients. Kuhnia pubescens plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various small organisms."
