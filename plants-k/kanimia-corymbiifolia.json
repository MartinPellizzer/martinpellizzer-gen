    "intro": "Kanimia corymbiifolia, commonly known as the silky kanimia, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, silky-hairy leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, round, yellow fruits. Kanimia corymbiifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in moist, shaded gardens."
