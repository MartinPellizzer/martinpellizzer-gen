    "intro": "Kayea eugeniifolia, commonly known as the pink hibiscus mealybug plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy texture and a distinctive pinkish hue. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a red or purple throat. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in warm, humid environments. However, it is also known to host the pink hibiscus mealybug, which can be a pest in some regions."
