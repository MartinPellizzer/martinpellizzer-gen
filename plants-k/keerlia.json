    "intro": "Keerlia, commonly known as the sacred lotus of India, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands and slow-moving waters of South and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in a sequence, starting with a deep purple bud that gradually opens into a white or pink flower. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor in the muddy substrate. Keerlia is also notable for its ability to purify water and provide habitat for various aquatic life. Its cultural and religious significance in Hinduism and Buddhism further highlights its importance beyond its botanical features."
