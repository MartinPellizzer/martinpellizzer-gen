    "intro": "Kohautia lasiocarpa, commonly known as the hairy-leaved kohautia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to South America, specifically Brazil, and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, hairy leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Kohautia lasiocarpa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ease of care."
