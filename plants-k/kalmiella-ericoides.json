    "intro": "Kalmiella ericoides, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features compact, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine, white wax. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom from late autumn to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. Kalmiella ericoides is often used in native landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
