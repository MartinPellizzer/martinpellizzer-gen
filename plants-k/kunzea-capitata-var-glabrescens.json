    "intro": "Kunzea capitata var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth kunzea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, though the variety glabrescens has a smoother texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in dense, spherical clusters, which bloom during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and coastal scrub environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
