    "intro": "Knowltonia fanninii, commonly known as the Fannin's strelitzia, is a rare and striking plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences composed of brightly colored bracts. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by specific insects, primarily beetles. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a humid, warm climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
