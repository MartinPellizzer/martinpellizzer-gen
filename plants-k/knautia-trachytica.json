    "intro": "Knautia trachytica, commonly known as the rough knautia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Knautia trachytica is valued in gardens for its ornamental flowers and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
