    "intro": "Koeleria convoluta subvar. supina, commonly known as the creeping wiregrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with slender, curling leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its compact growth habit makes it an important component of native grassland ecosystems."
