    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis var. sublanuginosa, commonly known as the silky koeleria, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, greenish-white flowers. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can withstand drought conditions due to its deep root system. This variety is often found in open habitats such as plains, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas."
