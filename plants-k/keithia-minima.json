    "intro": "Keithia minima, commonly known as the dwarf flax or small flax, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Linaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in damp, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited geographic distribution. Due to habitat loss, Keithia minima is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
