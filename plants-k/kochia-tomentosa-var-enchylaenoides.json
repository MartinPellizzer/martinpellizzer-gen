    "intro": "Kochia tomentosa var. enchylaenoides, commonly known as the silky kochia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairie and steppe habitats. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a thick, pubescent surface, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
