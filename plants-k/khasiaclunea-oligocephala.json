    "intro": "Khasiaclunea oligocephala, commonly known as the narrow-headed khasi clunea, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern regions of India. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy surface, and the flowers are usually pink or purple in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within its native range."
