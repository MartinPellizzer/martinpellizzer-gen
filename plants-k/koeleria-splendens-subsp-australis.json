It is a perennial grass that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as sandy soils and grasslands. The plant features slender, upright stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, blue to purple flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is adapted to arid environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in its native range."
