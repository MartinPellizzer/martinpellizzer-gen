It is characterized by its fine, silky, gray-green foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost silvery appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with brown or purplish hues. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions."
