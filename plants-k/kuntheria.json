    "intro": "Kuntheria, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are typically found in rocky or mountainous regions, where they thrive in well-drained soil and full sun. Kuntheria species are characterized by their compact growth habit and showy, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors. They are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they can grow on rocks or tree trunks without soil. Due to their unique appearance and habitat, Kuntheria plants are popular among orchid enthusiasts and are often cultivated in specialized gardens."
