    "intro": "Koeleria setacea var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate tufted grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
