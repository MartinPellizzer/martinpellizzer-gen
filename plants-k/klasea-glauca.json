    "intro": "Klasea glauca, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, blue-gray flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Klasea glauca is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
