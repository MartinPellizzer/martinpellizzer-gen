    "intro": "Koeleria nitida var. missouriana, commonly known as Missouri bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the central United States. It features fine, blue-green foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. The plant is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for native landscaping. Its dense growth habit helps prevent erosion and provides habitat for small insects and birds. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and drought tolerance."
