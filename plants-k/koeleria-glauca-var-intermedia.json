It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear blue to purple flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies, meadows, and open woodlands. This grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, including soil stabilization and habitat provision for wildlife."
