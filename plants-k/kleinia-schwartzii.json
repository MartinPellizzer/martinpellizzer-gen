    "intro": "Kleinia schwartzii, commonly known as the silverleaf daisy, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, gray-green foliage with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a daisy-like pattern, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
