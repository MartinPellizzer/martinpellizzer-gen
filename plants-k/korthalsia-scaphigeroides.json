    "intro": "Korthalsia scaphigeroides, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a striking member of the Apocynaceae family. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its large, showy, night-blooming flowers that emit a sweet fragrance. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are tubular with five lobes. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky appendages, aiding in wind dispersal."
