It features slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, a common adaptation in grasses. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in marginal habitats."
