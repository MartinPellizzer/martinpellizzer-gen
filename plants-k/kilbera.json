    "intro": "Kilbera, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Kilbera is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental beauty."
