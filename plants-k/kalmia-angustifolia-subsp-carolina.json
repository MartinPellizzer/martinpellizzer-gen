    "intro": "Kalmia angustifolia subsp. carolina, commonly known as Carolina alpine heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Appalachian Mountains. It features narrow, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and densely packed along its stems. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky, exposed habitats. Due to its limited range and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
