    "intro": "Koyamacalia quinqueloba, commonly known as the five-lobed koyama, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, five-lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, typically blooming during the late spring and early summer. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with multiple stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Koyamacalia quinqueloba is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
