    "intro": "Kuloa usambarensis, commonly known as the Usambara mountain fern, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the Usambara Mountains of Tanzania. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, typically between 1,000 and 2,000 meters above sea level. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its fronds, and it relies on wind for spore dispersal. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Kuloa usambarensis is considered a vulnerable species."
