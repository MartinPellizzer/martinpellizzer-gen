    "intro": "Karwinskia sessilifolia, commonly known as the Mexican yew, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, reddish-brown seeds enclosed in a fleshy, orange-colored aril. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls along the stems. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
