    "intro": "Kohleria strigosa, commonly known as the velvet leaf, is a tropical perennial plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and clusters of small, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens. It has a short rhizomatous stem and produces numerous stolons, which help in its propagation. Kohleria strigosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for with proper humidity and drainage."
