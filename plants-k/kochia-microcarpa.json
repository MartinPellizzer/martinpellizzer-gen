    "intro": "Kochia microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf Russian spinach, is a flowering plant in the amaranth family. It is native to central Asia and is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into dry, three-lobed capsules containing numerous seeds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its ability to thrive in poor soils and its drought tolerance. Kochia microcarpa is also used in traditional medicine in some regions for its purported health benefits."
