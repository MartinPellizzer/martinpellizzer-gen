    "intro": "Koeleria carniolica eriostachya, commonly known as the mountain grass or slender needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
