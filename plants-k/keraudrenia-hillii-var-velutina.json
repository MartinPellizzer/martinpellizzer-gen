    "intro": "Keraudrenia hillii var. velutina, commonly known as the velvet keraudrenia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the late spring and early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
