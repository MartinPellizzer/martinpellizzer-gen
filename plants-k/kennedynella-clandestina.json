    "intro": "Kennedynella clandestina, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pale green foliage and its striking, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom infrequently. Due to its elusive nature and habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species from further decline."
