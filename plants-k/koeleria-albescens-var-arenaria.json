    "intro": "Koeleria albescens var. arenaria, commonly known as the sandkoeleria, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes or disturbed areas. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its slender, wiry stems and narrow leaves are adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. It plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and is sometimes used in restoration projects in sandy environments."
