    "intro": "Kielmeyera, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Sapotaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and includes several species that are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value. The plants typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce small, yellowish flowers that are followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. Kielmeyera species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in a variety of habitats including forests and disturbed soils. They are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas outside their native range."
