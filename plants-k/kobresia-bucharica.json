    "intro": "Kobresia bucharica, commonly known as the Bukhara sedge, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability. Kobresia bucharica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is often found in steppic and desert ecosystems. Its resilience makes it an important component of the vegetation in arid environments."
