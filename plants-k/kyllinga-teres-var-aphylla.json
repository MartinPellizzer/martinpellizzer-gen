    "intro": "Kyllinga teres var. aphylla, commonly known as the smooth-leafed spurge, is a succulent plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. The leaves are typically reduced or absent, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish or yellowish in color. This species is adapted to arid environments and is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils."
