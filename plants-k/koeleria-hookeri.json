    "intro": "Koeleria hookeri, commonly known as Hooker's oatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of North America. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seed heads are often used in floral arrangements due to their delicate appearance. Koeleria hookeri is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in harsh, high-altitude habitats."
