It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that bear dense clusters of bright orange-red tubular flowers. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette. This species thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period, which typically spans from summer to autumn."
