It belongs to the genus Saintpaulia and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its native habitat. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive indoors. Katafa prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
