    "intro": "Kokonoria, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Andes, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a velvety texture. The plant has broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in rocky soils. Kokonoria holds cultural significance in Andean communities and is often associated with spiritual and medicinal practices."
