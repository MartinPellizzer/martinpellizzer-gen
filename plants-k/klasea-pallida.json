    "intro": "Klasea pallida, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent petals that give it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically in spring. Klasea pallida is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system to access scarce water resources. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
