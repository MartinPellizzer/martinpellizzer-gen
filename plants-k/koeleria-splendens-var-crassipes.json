    "intro": "Koeleria splendens var. crassipes, commonly known as the broadleaf koeleria, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, pinkish to purple flower clusters that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for native plant landscapes."
