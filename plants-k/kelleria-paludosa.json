    "intro": "Kelleria paludosa, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Kelleria paludosa plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
