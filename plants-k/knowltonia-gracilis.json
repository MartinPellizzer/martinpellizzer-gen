    "intro": "Knowltonia gracilis, commonly known as the slender stinging nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes other stinging nettles. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in fine, irritating hairs that cause a skin reaction upon contact. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, while its small greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels. Knowltonia gracilis is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
