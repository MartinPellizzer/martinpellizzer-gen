    "intro": "Koanophyllon cynanchifolium, commonly known as the Texas milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small white or yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which can be harmful to livestock and humans if ingested. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and along roadsides. Koanophyllon cynanchifolium plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though its ecological importance is still being studied."
