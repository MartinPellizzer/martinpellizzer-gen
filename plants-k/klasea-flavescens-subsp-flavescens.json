    "intro": "Klasea flavescens subsp. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow-flowered klasea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
