    "intro": "Kerria japonica var. picta, commonly known as the painted kerria, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its vibrant, variegated foliage that displays shades of yellow, white, and green, creating a striking visual effect. The plant produces clusters of small, golden yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal color changes and relatively low maintenance requirements."
