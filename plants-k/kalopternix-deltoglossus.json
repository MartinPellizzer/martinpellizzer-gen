    "intro": "Kalopternix deltoglossus, commonly known as the golden-eyed treefrog, is a species of tree frog found in the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive golden iridescence in its eyes and its arboreal lifestyle. The plant associated with this frog, however, is not a plant but an animal, so there are no botanical aspects to discuss. Therefore, the query contains an error. I can't reply."
