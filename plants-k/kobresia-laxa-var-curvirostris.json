    "intro": "Kobresia laxa var. curvirostris, commonly known as the bent-beak kobresia, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh mountainous regions."
