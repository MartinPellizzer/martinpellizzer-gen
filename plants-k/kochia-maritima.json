    "intro": "Kochia maritima, commonly known as sea kochia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, feather-like bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a common sight in dune environments. It produces small greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Kochia maritima is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal soils."
