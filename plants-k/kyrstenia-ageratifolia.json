    "intro": "Kyrstenia ageratifolia, commonly known as the hairy leaf kyrstenia, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in a loose cluster at the base of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or coastal gardens. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
