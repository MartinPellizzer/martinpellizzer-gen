    "intro": "Koelzella pabularia, commonly known as the rock bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features a basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually blue or violet in color. It is adapted to cold climates and has a low-growing habit to withstand harsh weather conditions. Koelzella pabularia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
