It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its small, spike-like inflorescences contain numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized grass species."
