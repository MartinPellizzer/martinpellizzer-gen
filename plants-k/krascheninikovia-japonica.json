    "intro": "Krascheninikovia japonica, commonly known as the Japanese hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Japan and parts of East Asia. It features slender, wiry stems that form dense mats, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its foliage is characterized by narrow, grass-like leaves with a soft, fuzzy texture. Krascheninikovia japonica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shaded conditions."
