    "intro": "Kalanchoe albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered Kalanchoe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. It is a member of the Crassulaceae family and is known for its ability to propagate through offsets and leaf cuttings. Kalanchoe albiflora is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
