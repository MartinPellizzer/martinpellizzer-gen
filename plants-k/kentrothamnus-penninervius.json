    "intro": "Kentrothamnus penninervius, commonly known as the narrow-veined wattle, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pea-like yellow flowers that appear in late summer. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits soil fertility. This plant is well adapted to drought and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
