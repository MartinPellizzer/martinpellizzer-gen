    "intro": "Kleinia balsamica, commonly known as the balsam shrub, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features dense, compact growth with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a powdery white coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or arid landscapes. Its ability to store water in its leaves helps it survive in dry conditions."
