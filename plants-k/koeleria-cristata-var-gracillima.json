It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and distinctive, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its narrow leaves and compact stature make it a hardy and resilient species. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
