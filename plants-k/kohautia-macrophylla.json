    "intro": "Kohautia macrophylla, commonly known as the giant kohautia, is a striking member of the Asparagaceae family native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, strap-shaped leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces striking white to pale blue flowers in dense, raceme-like clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions and is often found in coastal or limestone soils. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
