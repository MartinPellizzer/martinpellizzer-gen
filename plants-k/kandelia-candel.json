    "intro": "Kandelia candel, commonly known as the mangrove apple or candlewood, is a species of mangrove tree native to the coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its distinctive, candle-like appearance with long, slender branches that form a dense canopy. The plant has specialized adaptations for saline environments, including pneumatophores for gas exchange and salt-excreting leaves. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species. Kandelia candel is also valued for its timber and is often used in traditional medicine."
