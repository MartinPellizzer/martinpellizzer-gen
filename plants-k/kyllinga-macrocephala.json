    "intro": "Kyllinga macrocephala, commonly known as the broad-headed spikerush, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its upright, cylindrical stems and clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Kyllinga macrocephala thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds and lakes."
