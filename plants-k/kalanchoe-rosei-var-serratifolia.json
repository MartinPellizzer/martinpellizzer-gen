It features thick, fleshy leaves with a serrated margin, which help it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces clusters of vibrant, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow during the winter months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight. Kalanchoe rosei var. serratifolia is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
