    "intro": "Krascheninnikovia ceratoides subsp. deserticola, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It has small, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy soils and is well-adapted to drought conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in desert ecosystems."
