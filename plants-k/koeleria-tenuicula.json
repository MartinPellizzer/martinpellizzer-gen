    "intro": "Koeleria tenuicula, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats or tufts, with slender, wiry stems that are often less than 10 centimeters tall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in harsh environments, tolerating cold, dry conditions and poor soil, making it a characteristic component of tundra and rocky habitats. Its morphology and ecological role make it an important species for studying plant adaptations to extreme climates."
