    "intro": "Koeleria phleoides f. lobulata, commonly known as the lobed koeleria, is a perennial grass species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in its native range."
