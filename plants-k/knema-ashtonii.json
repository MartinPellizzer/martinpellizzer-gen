    "intro": "Knema ashtonii, commonly known as the Ashton's knema, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. It produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically eaten by various native animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Knema ashtonii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
