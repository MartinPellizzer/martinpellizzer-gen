It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. The plant features erect, branched stems covered in small, glandular hairs that give it a sticky texture. Its small, white or pale blue flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in the summer months. Kunzia glandulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
