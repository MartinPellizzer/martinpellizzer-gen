    "intro": "Kyllinga platyphylla var. longifolia, commonly known as slender swamp grass, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green and can grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny white or pale pink flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in moist soils, making it a common weed in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats. It is often found in marshes, ditches, and along the edges of ponds and lakes."
