    "intro": "Keraudrenia hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's keraudrenia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, which are typically green with a slightly velvety texture. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with a pale yellow or greenish hue, and it produces small, round fruits that contain seeds. Keraudrenia hookeri is primarily of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
