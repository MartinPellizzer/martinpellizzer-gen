    "intro": "Kalimantanorchis, commonly known as the Borneo orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that display a range of colors, including white, yellow, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in the dense canopy of the rainforest. Its unique botanical features include specialized roots that absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, and it plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its habitat. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Kalimantanorchis is considered a vulnerable species."
