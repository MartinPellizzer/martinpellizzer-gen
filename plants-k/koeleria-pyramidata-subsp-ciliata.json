    "intro": "Koeleria pyramidata subsp. ciliata, commonly known as the Sierra grass or mountain grass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, rocky slopes, and sandy soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have ciliate margins, which is a key identifying feature. This subspecies is adapted to arid environments and is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological resilience."
