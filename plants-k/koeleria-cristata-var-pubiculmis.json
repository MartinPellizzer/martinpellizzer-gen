    "intro": "Koeleria cristata var. pubiculmis, commonly known as the pubescent bentgrass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and ecological researchers."
