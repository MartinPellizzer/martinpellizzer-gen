    "intro": "Kyllinga panicea, commonly known as swamp spikerush, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It features upright, grass-like stems that are often reddish in color, with small, clustered inflorescences at the tips. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Kyllinga panicea thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
