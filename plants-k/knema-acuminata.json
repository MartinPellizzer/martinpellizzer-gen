    "intro": "Knema acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved knema, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Knema acuminata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
