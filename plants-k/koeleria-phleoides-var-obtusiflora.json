    "intro": "Koeleria phleoides var. obtusiflora, commonly known as the blunt-flowered koeleria, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and rocky soils. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in disturbed or arid environments. This variety is characterized by its blunt, rounded flower heads, which distinguish it from other related species."
