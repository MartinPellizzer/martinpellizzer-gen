    "intro": "Krascheninnikovia lanata var. subspinosa, commonly known as the sand couch grass, is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and wiry, spiny stems that help it withstand harsh conditions. The plant produces small, pale green to brownish flowers in spikelets, which are typically arranged in clusters. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss, making it well-suited for sandy soils. This variety is particularly notable for its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent soil erosion in desert ecosystems."
