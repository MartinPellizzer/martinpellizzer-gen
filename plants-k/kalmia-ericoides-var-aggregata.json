    "intro": "Kalmia ericoides var. aggregata, commonly known as the clustered bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. Its showy, bell-shaped flowers are pink to red and bloom in late spring, adding ornamental value to woodland gardens. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
