    "intro": "Kibessia coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf kibessia, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its bark is thick and corky, which provides some resistance to drought and pests. Kibessia coriacea is often found in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments."
