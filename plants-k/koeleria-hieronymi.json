    "intro": "Koeleria hieronymi, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a perennial grass that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert and semi-desert environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to survive in harsh conditions with minimal water availability. Koeleria hieronymi plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
