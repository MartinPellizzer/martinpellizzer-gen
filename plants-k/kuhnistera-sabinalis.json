    "intro": "Kuhnistera sabinalis, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Kuhnistera sabinalis plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
