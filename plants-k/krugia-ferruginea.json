It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, rusty-colored hair, giving it its common name. Krugia ferruginea is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
