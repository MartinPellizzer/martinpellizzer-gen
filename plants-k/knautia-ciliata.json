    "intro": "Knautia ciliata, commonly known as the fringed knautia, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and rocky soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers have distinctive fringed petals that give it its common name. Knautia ciliata is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
