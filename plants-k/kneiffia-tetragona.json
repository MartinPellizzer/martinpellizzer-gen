    "intro": "Kneiffia tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled kniphofia, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asphodelaceae and is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces striking, cone-shaped inflorescences with bright orange or yellow flowers. Kneiffia tetragona is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils. It thrives in full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
