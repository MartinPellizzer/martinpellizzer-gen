    "intro": "Kentia deplanchei, commonly known as the Deplanche's kentia, is a species of cycad native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and its large, pinnate leaves that are often a deep green color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Kentia deplanchei is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for indoor cultivation. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often prized as a decorative plant."
