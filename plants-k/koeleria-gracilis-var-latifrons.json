    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis var. latifrons, commonly known as the broad-fruited wiregrass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, spikelet-based flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as prairies and coastal dunes. Due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
