    "intro": "Knautia integrifolia var. hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid meadow knautia, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of pink to purple, fluffy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a slightly rough texture, with the basal leaves being more elongated. This variety is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it a versatile addition to meadows and borders."
