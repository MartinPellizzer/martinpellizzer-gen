    "intro": "Knema lampongensis, commonly known as the Lampong knema, is a small evergreen tree native to the lowland rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. It is often found in humid, shaded environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
