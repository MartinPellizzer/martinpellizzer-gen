    "intro": "Kali, commonly known as the \"devil's trumpet,\" is a flowering plant belonging to the genus *Datura* in the nightshade family. It is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or purple, opening at night. The plant produces spiny, egg-shaped berries that contain toxic seeds. Kali is native to the Americas but has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract nocturnal pollinators like moths."
