    "intro": "Koeleria niederleinii var. mutica, commonly known as the rough koeleria, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny blue to purple flowers, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
