    "intro": "Knautia basaltica, commonly known as the basaltic knautia, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant pink to purple flowers. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are gray-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its showy blooms. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous environments. Knautia basaltica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to flourish in challenging alpine conditions."
