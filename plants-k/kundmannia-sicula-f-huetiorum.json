    "intro": "Kundmannia sicula f. huetiorum, commonly known as the Huet's form of Sicilian kundmannia, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in coastal or mountainous areas. Its leaves are finely divided and have a strong, spicy scent, while its flowers are small and white or pale yellow. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
