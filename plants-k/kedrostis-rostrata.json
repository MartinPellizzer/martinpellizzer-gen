    "intro": "Kedrostis rostrata, commonly known as the horned burr or horned amaranth, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spiky, triangular seed pods that resemble horns. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. Kedrostis rostrata is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid environments due to its drought-resistant properties. It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
