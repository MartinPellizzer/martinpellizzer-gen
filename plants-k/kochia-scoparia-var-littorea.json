    "intro": "Kochia scoparia var. littorea, commonly known as sea kochia, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in late summer, followed by bract-like leaves that turn red or purple in the fall. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it an important plant for coastal dune stabilization. Sea kochia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience to harsh maritime conditions."
