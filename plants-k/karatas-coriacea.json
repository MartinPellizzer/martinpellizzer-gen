    "intro": "Karatas coriacea, commonly known as the rough karatas, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by distinctive, spiky fruits. Its woody stems are often branched and can grow up to several meters in height. Karatas coriacea is well adapted to dry conditions and is often used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
