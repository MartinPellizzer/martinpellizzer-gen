    "intro": "Kungia aliciae var. komarovii, commonly known as the Komarovii kungia, is a rare and striking member of the Asteraceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and South Africa. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and vibrant, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
