    "intro": "Koeleria cristata var. canescens, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often forming dense mats or tufts. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to purple flowers. Its hairy texture, particularly on the stems and leaves, gives it its common name. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
