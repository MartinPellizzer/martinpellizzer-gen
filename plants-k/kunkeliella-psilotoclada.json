    "intro": "Kunkeliella psilotoclada, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that form dense, cushion-like clusters. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones known as strobila, which are typically located at the base of the foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest floors. Kunkeliella psilotoclada plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
