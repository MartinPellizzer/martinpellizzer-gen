    "intro": "Koelpinia deflexa, commonly known as the curled lip orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant features a slender, often\u530d\u5310\u7684 rhizome with small, clustered pseudobulbs. Its flowers are characterized by their unique, curling lip and vivid colors, often ranging from yellow to orange. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
