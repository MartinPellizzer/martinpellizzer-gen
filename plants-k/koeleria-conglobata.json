    "intro": "Koeleria conglobata, commonly known as the clustered grass or woolly grass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as tundra, meadows, and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and the flowers are usually pale green to brownish in color. Koeleria conglobata is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine or arctic environments."
