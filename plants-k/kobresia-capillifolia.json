    "intro": "Kobresia capillifolia, commonly known as the tufted cat's tail grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine and arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fine, hair-like leaves that give it a soft, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets, which are borne on slender, hairy stems. Kobresia capillifolia is well adapted to cold, harsh environments and is often found in tundra and mountainous regions. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a stabilizer of soil in fragile alpine ecosystems."
