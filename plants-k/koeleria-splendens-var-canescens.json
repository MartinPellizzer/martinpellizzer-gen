    "intro": "Koeleria splendens var. canescens, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features slender, upright stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically narrow and covered with a fine layer of silvery hair, giving the plant its characteristic appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. This plant is often used in ornamental gardens for its delicate, grass-like foliage and subtle floral display."
