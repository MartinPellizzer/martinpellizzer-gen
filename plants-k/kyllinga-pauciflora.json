It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its grass-like appearance and slender, erect stems. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist to wet soil conditions. Its small, spike-like inflorescences contain numerous tiny flowers, which are usually green or reddish in color. Kyllinga pauciflora plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
