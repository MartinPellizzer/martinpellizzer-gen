It is a low-growing shrub that produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from underground water sources. Kirganelia dumetosa is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
