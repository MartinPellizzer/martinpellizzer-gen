    "intro": "Kalopternix mantinianus, commonly known as the Mantianis tree frog, is a unique amphibian found exclusively in the mountainous regions of southern Greece. This species is notable for its distinctive physical features, including a robust body, warty skin, and a coloration that varies from brown to olive-green. Botanically, it inhabits dense forests and shrublands, often near streams or moist areas where vegetation is abundant. Its survival is closely linked to the specific plant communities that provide shelter and moisture. Conservation efforts are crucial due to habitat loss and environmental changes affecting its botanical niche."
