    "intro": "Kallstroemia pennellii, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Kallstroemia pennellii is often found in coastal dunes and other xeric habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
