    "intro": "Kunzea propinqua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved kunzea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its aromatic foliage contains essential oils, making it a valuable plant in traditional bush medicine and aromatherapy. Kunzea propinqua is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in heathland and coastal scrub environments."
