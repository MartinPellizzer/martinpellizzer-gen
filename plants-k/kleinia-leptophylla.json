    "intro": "Kleinia leptophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed kleinia, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and fleshy, narrow leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
