It is a perennial herb with slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salty, windy environments. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often considered a characteristic species of coastal flora."
