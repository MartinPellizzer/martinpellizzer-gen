    "intro": "Koeleria vallesiana subsp. humilis, commonly known as the valley grass or dwarf koeleria, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is adapted to cold climates and can withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-elevation ecosystems."
