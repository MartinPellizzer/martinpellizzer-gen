    "intro": "Klasea strangulata, commonly known as the strangler fig, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia. It is a hemiepiphyte, meaning it begins its life as an epiphyte growing on the surface of another plant. As it matures, it sends roots down to the ground, eventually surrounding and suffocating its host plant. The plant has large, broad leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers. Its fruit is a fleshy, yellowish berry that attracts various animals, aiding in seed dispersal."
