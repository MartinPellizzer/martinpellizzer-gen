    "intro": "Kickxia macilenta, commonly known as the slender rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces delicate, yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens."
