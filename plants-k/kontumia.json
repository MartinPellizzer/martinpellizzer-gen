    "intro": "Kontumia, commonly known as the Vietnamese orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring moist, well-drained soil and partial shade. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it in the rocky or forested habitats where it thrives. Kontumia is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its cultural significance in local traditions."
