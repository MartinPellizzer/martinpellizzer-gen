    "intro": "Kaukenia, commonly known as the yellow-flowered kaukenia, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its showy yellow or orange ray florets. The plants typically grow in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Kaukenia species are herbaceous perennials with upright stems and clustered leaves. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their bright, daisy-like flowers."
