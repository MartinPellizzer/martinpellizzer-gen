    "intro": "Kuhnia kuhnia, commonly known as the marsh gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows up to 60 cm tall, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Kuhnia kuhnia thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in peat bogs and fens. It plays an important ecological role by supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
