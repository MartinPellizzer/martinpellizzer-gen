    "intro": "Koeleria talievii, commonly known as the Taliev's feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and delicate, feathery inflorescences that give it a soft, plume-like appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with small, tightly packed leaves. Koeleria talievii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
