    "intro": "Kyllinga odorata var. bulbifera, commonly known as the bulbiferous spurge or swamp spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, triangular leaves and has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. One of its notable botanical features is the production of bulbils, which are small plantlets that form on the stems and can develop into new plants. This adaptation aids in its propagation and survival in wetland environments."
