    "intro": "Koeleria grandis, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Koeleria grandis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species that thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
