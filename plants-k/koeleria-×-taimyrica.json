    "intro": "Koeleria \u00d7 taimyrica, commonly known as the hybrid grass or Taity grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted form with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cold climates and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
