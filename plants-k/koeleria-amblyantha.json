    "intro": "Koeleria amblyantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf wintergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, often reddish stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny blue to purple flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Koeleria amblyantha is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native pollinators."
