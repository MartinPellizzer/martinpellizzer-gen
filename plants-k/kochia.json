It is characterized by its vibrant, showy bracts that display red, orange, or purple hues in the fall. The plant belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Kochia has a short lifespan, typically living for one growing season. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments."
