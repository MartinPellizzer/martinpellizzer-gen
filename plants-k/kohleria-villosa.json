    "intro": "Kohleria villosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf kohleria, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, often with contrasting white or yellow markings. Kohleria villosa is typically grown as a houseplant due to its preference for humid, warm environments and indirect light. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of care in suitable conditions."
