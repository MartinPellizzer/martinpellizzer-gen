    "intro": "Kitchingia porphyrocalyx, commonly known as the purple calyx kitchingia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive purple calyces that encase its small, white flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with hairy stems and ovate leaves. Its flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
