    "intro": "Karawata prasinata, commonly known as the green karawata, is a small evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are typically visited by native bees and insects. Its growth habit is compact, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Karawata prasinata is also valued for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and its resilience to coastal conditions."
