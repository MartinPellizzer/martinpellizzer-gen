    "intro": "Koeleria phleoides f. breviaristata, commonly known as the short-bracted koeleria, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairy along the edges. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are densely arranged, with the bracts being shorter than the flowering glumes. This variety thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important plant for ecological studies and habitat restoration projects."
