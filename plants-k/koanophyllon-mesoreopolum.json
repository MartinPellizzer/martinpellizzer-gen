It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Koanophyllon mesoreopolum is an important plant for pollinators and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
