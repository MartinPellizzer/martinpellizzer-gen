    "intro": "Koenigia tortuosa var. tibetana, commonly known as the Tibetan stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are fleshy and covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular specimen among succulent enthusiasts."
