    "intro": "Knautia arvensis subsp. angustata, commonly known as narrowleaf knautia, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, pink to purple flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. Its flowers are composed of numerous small, tubular blooms that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in dry conditions."
