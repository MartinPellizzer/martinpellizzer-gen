    "intro": "Kalmia polifolia f. leucantha, commonly known as the white-leaved mountain laurel, is a unique variant of the mountain laurel species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage, which is predominantly white to pale green, distinguishing it from the typical green leaves of the species. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable addition to native plant collections."
