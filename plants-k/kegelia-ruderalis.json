    "intro": "Kegelia ruderalis, commonly known as the rough kegelia, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Burseraceae, which includes frankincense and myrrh trees. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruits are three-winged capsules that release seeds when mature. Kegelia ruderalis is often found in disturbed habitats, such as roadsides and abandoned fields, due to its ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
