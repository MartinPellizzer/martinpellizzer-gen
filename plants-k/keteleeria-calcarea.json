    "intro": "Keteleeria calcarea, commonly known as the limestone fir, is a coniferous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly twisted. The plant thrives in calcareous soils, which are rich in calcium, and is often found in mountainous regions. Its cones are small and usually hang in clusters, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Keteleeria calcarea plays a significant role in forest ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to soil stability in its native range."
