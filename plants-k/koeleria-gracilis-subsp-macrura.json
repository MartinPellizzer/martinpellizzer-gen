    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis subsp. macrura, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial grass characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. It has a low-growing habit and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a potential candidate for restoration projects."
