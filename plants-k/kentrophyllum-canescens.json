    "intro": "Kentrophyllum canescens, commonly known as the white sand dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are linear and covered with fine, silky hairs, while its flowers are pale yellow to white in color. Kentrophyllum canescens plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
