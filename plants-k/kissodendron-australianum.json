    "intro": "Kissodendron australianum, commonly known as the Australian ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of northern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, hard, and heavy wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The tree has simple, alternate, elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy on the upper surface. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by small, round, red fruits. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resistance to drought and poor soil conditions."
