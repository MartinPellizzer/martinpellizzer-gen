    "intro": "Koehneria, commonly known as the snow grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. These plants are native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Koehneria species are typically low-growing, with dense, grass-like foliage that forms compact mats. They produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, often white or pale-colored flowers. These hardy plants are well adapted to cold climates and are often found in rocky or sandy soils."
