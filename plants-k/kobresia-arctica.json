    "intro": "Kobresia arctica, commonly known as Arctic kobresia, is a flowering plant belonging to the Poaceae family, commonly found in Arctic and alpine regions. It is a low-growing perennial grass that forms dense mats, often covering rocky or barren ground. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or greenish flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and can survive in nutrient-poor soils. Kobresia arctica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife."
