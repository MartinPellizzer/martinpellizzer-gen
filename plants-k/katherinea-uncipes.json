It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Katherinea uncipes is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. It is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
