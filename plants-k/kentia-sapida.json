    "intro": "Kentia sapida, commonly known as the Kentia palm, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feather-like fronds that grow in a dense, cascading pattern. The plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its tolerance for moderate humidity. Kentia palms are known for their slow growth and can reach heights of up to 20 feet in their natural habitat. Their foliage provides a lush, green aesthetic, making them a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor landscaping."
