    "intro": "Koanophyllon dolphini, commonly known as the Dolphini blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Koanophyllon dolphini is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinators."
