    "intro": "Koeleria supra-arenaria, commonly known as the sand-dwelling grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and compact, grass-like structure, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or inland sand plains. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, typically in shades of pink or purple. Koeleria supra-arenaria plays a vital role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion in its native habitats."
