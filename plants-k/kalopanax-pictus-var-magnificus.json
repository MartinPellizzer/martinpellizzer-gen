    "intro": "Kalopanax pictus var. magnificus, commonly known as the magnificent painted-leaf tree, is a striking deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves that are often adorned with distinctive white or yellow spots and margins. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and small mammals. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage, which changes color throughout the seasons. Kalopanax pictus var. magnificus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden landscapes."
