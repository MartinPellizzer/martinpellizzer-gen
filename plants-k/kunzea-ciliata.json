    "intro": "Kunzea ciliata, commonly known as the coastal kunzea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in spring. Kunzea ciliata is well adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden environments, making it a hardy species found in coastal dunes and heathlands. Its aromatic foliage and resilience to harsh coastal conditions make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
