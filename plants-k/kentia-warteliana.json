    "intro": "Kentia warteliana, commonly known as the Kentia palm, is a tropical plant native to the island of New Guinea. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and gracefully arching fronds that give it a lush, elegant appearance. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Its leaves are long, narrow, and have a smooth, waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. Kentia warteliana is popular as a houseplant due to its ability to adapt well to indoor conditions and its air-purifying qualities."
