    "intro": "Kobresia globularis, commonly known as the globular grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau and neighboring areas. It forms dense, cushion-like rosettes of tightly packed, short, succulent leaves that help it survive in cold and arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its unique morphology allows it to retain heat and moisture, making it well-adapted to its harsh environment. Kobresia globularis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in alpine ecosystems."
