    "intro": "Koeleria sterilis, commonly known as the sterile Koeleria, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Due to its limited seed production, it is considered a sterile or nearly sterile species, which contributes to its rarity in natural habitats."
