    "intro": "Koenigia delicatula, commonly known as the delicate rockfoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in horticultural settings."
