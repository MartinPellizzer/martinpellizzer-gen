    "intro": "Kinabaluchloa nebulosa, commonly known as the misty mountain fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray fronds that give it a misty appearance, especially when backlit. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and well-drained, acidic soil. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typical of many ferns, and it relies on spores for propagation. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Kinabaluchloa nebulosa is considered a vulnerable species."
