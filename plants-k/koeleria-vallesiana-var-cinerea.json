    "intro": "Koeleria vallesiana var. cinerea, commonly known as the gray hair grass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its delicate, hair-like foliage. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is distinguished by its grayish-blue coloration, which is due to the dense covering of fine hairs on its leaves and stems."
