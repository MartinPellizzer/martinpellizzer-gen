    "intro": "Kallias dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal orchid native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and debris for sustenance. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the surrounding environment. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Kallias dubia is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
