    "intro": "Kohautia brachyloba, commonly known as the short-stalked kohautia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, tufted inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in the alpine regions of the South Island. Its flowers are usually pale blue or greenish in color, and it blooms during the late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Kohautia brachyloba is considered a threatened species."
