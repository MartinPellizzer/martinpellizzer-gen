    "intro": "Kibatalia stenopetala, commonly known as the African milkwood tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant. Kibatalia stenopetala is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial in soil enrichment."
