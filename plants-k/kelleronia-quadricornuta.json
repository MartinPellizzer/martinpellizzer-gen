It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its distinctive four-horned structure on its inflorescence, which gives it its common name. It typically grows as an epiphytic plant, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. The flowers are small and often white or pale pink, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
