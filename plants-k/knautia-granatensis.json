    "intro": "Knautia granatensis, commonly known as the Granatense Edelweiss, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its fluffy, white to pale yellow flower heads that resemble those of the true edelweiss. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Knautia granatensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic alpine conditions."
