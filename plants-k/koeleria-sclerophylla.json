    "intro": "Koeleria sclerophylla, commonly known as the hard-leaved grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, wiry leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, greenish-brown flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including drought and poor soil, making it a resilient component of desert and steppe ecosystems. Koeleria sclerophylla plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitats."
