    "intro": "Kobresia stenocarpa var. royleana, commonly known as the Tibetan feather grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia, including Tibet, Nepal, and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces slender, wiry stems with fine, hair-like leaves. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Its small, spike-like inflorescences bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of grasses. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine and subalpine habitats."
