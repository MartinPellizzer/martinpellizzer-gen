    "intro": "Kaluhaburunghos stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed forest fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as tropical rainforests and mountainous regions. The plant's fronds are usually arranged in a compact rosette, with each leaf bearing a serrated edge. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Kaluhaburunghos stenophyllus plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for various microorganisms."
