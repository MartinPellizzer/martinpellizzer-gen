    "intro": "Knorringia sibirica subsp. sibirica, commonly known as Siberian knorringia, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subarctic regions, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features a low-growing rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early summer. It is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions and has a slow growth rate. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
