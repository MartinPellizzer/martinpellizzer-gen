    "intro": "Koeleria \u00d7 mixta, commonly known as the hybrid wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species that exhibits a mix of characteristics from its parent species, Koeleria macrantha and Koeleria rupicola. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, showing a preference for temperate climates. The plant features slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Due to its hardy nature and adaptability, Koeleria \u00d7 mixta is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
