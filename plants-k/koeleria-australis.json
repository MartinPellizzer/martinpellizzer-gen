    "intro": "Koeleria australis, commonly known as the Australian feather grass, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a low-growing perennial grass that forms dense, tufted clumps with fine, silver-blue foliage. The plant produces slender spikelets that bear small, pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in spring. Koeleria australis is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant. It is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
