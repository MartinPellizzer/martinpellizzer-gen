    "intro": "Kunkeliella retamoides, commonly known as the redbrush, is a shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, spiny branches and small, leathery leaves that are typically reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
