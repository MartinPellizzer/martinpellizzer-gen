    "intro": "Kalomikta, commonly known as the \"ice plant,\" is a succulent plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It has fleshy, water-storing leaves that help it survive in cold, arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the brief summer season. Kalomikta is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils, and it thrives in full sun. Its unique ability to store water makes it well adapted to extreme climates."
