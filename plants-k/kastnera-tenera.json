    "intro": "Kastnera tenera, commonly known as the silverleaf kalanchoe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, thick leaves that are covered in a silvery, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during the spring and summer months. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
