    "intro": "Kobresia curticeps var. gyirongensis, commonly known as the Gyirong grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and neighboring areas. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and compact, hairy leaves that are adapted to cold and arid conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in alpine meadows and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its resilience and ecological importance, it plays a significant role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments."
