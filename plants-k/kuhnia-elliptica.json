    "intro": "Kuhnia elliptica, commonly known as the narrowleaf water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. The plant has elongated, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes and bloom in late spring to early summer. Kuhnia elliptica plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl."
