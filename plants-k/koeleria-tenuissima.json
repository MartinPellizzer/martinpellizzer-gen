    "intro": "Koeleria tenuissima, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor soils, making it a hardy species. It is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats where it plays a role in soil stabilization. Koeleria tenuissima is also used in some traditional herbal practices for its purported medicinal properties."
