    "intro": "Koeleria alpigena var. mannagettae, commonly known as the Sierra grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, such as alpine meadows and mountain slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in arid and mountainous regions."
