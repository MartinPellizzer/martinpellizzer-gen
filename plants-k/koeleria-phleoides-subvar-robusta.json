It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low moisture and high sunlight exposure. Its ecological role includes providing forage for grazing animals and stabilizing soil in disturbed areas."
