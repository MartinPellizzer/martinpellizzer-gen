    "intro": "Koeleria trivialis, commonly known as the three-flowered grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features fine, soft blades with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear three to five flowers, which are usually pale blue or purple in color. Koeleria trivialis is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments. Its delicate appearance and adaptability make it a characteristic species of dry, open habitats."
