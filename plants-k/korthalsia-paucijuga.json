    "intro": "Korthalsia paucijuga, commonly known as the narrow-leaf korthalsia, is a tropical shrub native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are often fragrant. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Korthalsia paucijuga is adapted to grow in dry, rocky habitats and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
