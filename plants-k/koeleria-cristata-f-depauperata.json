    "intro": "Koeleria cristata f. depauperata, commonly known as the sparse form of the tufted grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces fluffy, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its delicate structure, it is often found in open habitats such as tundra and mountain meadows."
