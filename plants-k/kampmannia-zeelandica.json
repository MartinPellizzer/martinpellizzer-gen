    "intro": "Kampmannia zeelandica, commonly known as the Zeelandian sandwort, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to the coastal regions of the Netherlands. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, fleshy leaves that are adapted to tolerate saline and sandy soils. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate touch to its habitat. Kampmannia zeelandica is often found in dunes and salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes through its extensive root system. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects in coastal environments."
