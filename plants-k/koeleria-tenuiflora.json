    "intro": "Koeleria tenuiflora, commonly known as slenderflower grass, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in alpine or arctic environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Koeleria tenuiflora is often found in open habitats such as tundra, meadows, and mountain slopes. Its low-growing habit and ability to withstand harsh climates make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
