It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are hairy and often covered in fine pubescence, giving it a distinctive texture. This species is typically found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils."
