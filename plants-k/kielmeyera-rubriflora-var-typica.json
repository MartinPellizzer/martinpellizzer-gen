    "intro": "Kielmeyera rubriflora var. typica, commonly known as the red-flowered kielmeyera, is a species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with lanceolate,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces striking red flowers in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its flowers are actinomorphic and have five petals, with a distinctive red coloration that attracts pollinators such as bees and birds. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds."
