    "intro": "Kohleria maculata, commonly known as the spotted kohleria, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, meaning it thrives on the surface of other plants rather than in soil. Its foliage consists of glossy, dark green leaves with a velvety texture. Kohleria maculata is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
