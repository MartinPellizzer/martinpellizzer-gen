    "intro": "Knautia sylvatica var. lancifolia, commonly known as the lance-leaved knautia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often tinged with purple. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in wildflower gardens and meadow landscapes."
