    "intro": "Kleinia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly cushion plant, is a succulent shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and fuzzy, silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers during the warmer months, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water, which is essential for survival in its native habitat. Kleinia tomentosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
