    "intro": "Kuhnia paniculata, commonly known as the marsh thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in temperate regions. It features a basal rosette of narrow, bluish-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tall, branched flowering stems that bear yellow flowers arranged in panicles. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in marshy habitats. Kuhnia paniculata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils."
