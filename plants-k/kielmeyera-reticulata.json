    "intro": "Kielmeyera reticulata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, often reddish-brown bark. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by woody, round fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and have a leathery texture. Due to its hard, heavy wood, it has been historically valued for musical instruments and furniture."
