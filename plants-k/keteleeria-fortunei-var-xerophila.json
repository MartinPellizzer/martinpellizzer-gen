    "intro": "Keteleeria fortunei var. xerophila, commonly known as the Chinese fir, is a deciduous conifer native to China. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure typical of the Cupressaceae family. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting xerophytic traits such as thick cuticles and reduced leaf surface area. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The tree is valued for its timber and plays a role in ecological restoration projects in its native habitat."
