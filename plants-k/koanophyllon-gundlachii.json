    "intro": "Koanophyllon gundlachii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads made up of many small florets. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments with its deep root system and waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy seed heads that disperse its seeds via the wind. Koanophyllon gundlachii is often found in sandy or rocky soils and plays a role in stabilizing desert ecosystems."
