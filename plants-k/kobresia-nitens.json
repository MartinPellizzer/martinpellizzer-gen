    "intro": "Kobresia nitens, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Its dense growth habit makes it an important component of steppe and grassland ecosystems. Kobresia nitens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping."
