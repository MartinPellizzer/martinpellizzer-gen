It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silky foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pale blue to purple in color. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
