    "intro": "Karomia humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's karomia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes cashews and mangoes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, red fruits that are typically covered in a whitish, waxy coating. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within the rainforest canopy, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem. Due to habitat loss, Karomia humbertii is considered vulnerable and is of interest to botanists studying tropical plant diversity."
