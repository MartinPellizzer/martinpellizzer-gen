    "intro": "Kotschya schweinfurthii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, blooming during the dry season. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Kotschya schweinfurthii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
