    "intro": "Kerneria tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled kerneria, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically four-angled in cross-section. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. Kerneria tetragona thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and flowering display."
