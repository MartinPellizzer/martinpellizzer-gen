    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis subsp. seminuda, commonly known as slender wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in open, sandy or gravelly habitats, often in disturbed areas or along roadsides. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are usually covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
