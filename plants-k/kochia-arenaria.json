    "intro": "Kochia arenaria, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing annual or biennial species that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. Kochia arenaria is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and tolerate drought conditions."
