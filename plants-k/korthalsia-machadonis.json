    "intro": "Korthalsia machadonis, commonly known as the Malagasy orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are usually elliptical and glossy, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss, Korthalsia machadonis is considered a rare and endangered species."
