    "intro": "Koeleria salzmannii, commonly known as Salzmann's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and delicate, feathery inflorescences that resemble soft plumes. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its small, spike-like flowers are usually pale blue to purple in color, and it is often found in alpine meadows. Koeleria salzmannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing fragile mountainous terrain."
