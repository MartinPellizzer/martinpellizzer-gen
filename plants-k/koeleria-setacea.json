    "intro": "Koeleria setacea, commonly known as the slender spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, wiry stems that are often branched and bear small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture. Koeleria setacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
