    "intro": "Keratochlaena rigidifolia, commonly known as the rigid-leaved keratochlaena, is a species of flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, rigid, and often fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette formation. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, which bloom during the rainy season. Keratochlaena rigidifolia thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
