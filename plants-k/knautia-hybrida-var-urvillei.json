    "intro": "Knautia hybrida var. urvillei, commonly known as the Urville's knautia, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of fluffy, pinkish-white to violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features narrow, serrated leaves that are typically hairy, contributing to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
