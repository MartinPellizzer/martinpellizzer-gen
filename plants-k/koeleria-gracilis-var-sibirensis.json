    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis var. sibirensis, commonly known as the Siberian slender grass, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Siberia and Central Asia. It is a member of the Poaceae family, characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate to subarctic climates. Its flowers are usually pale blue or purple, and it blooms during the late spring to early summer. Koeleria gracilis var. sibirensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
