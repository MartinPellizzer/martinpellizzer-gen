    "intro": "Kreodanthus bugabae, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often translucent leaves that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in a spike, lacking the showy petals seen in many other orchids. Kreodanthus bugabae is a lithophytic species, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
