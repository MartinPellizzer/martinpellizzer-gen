    "intro": "Koelreutera molluginoides, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a problematic weed in certain ecosystems."
