    "intro": "Kyllinga filiformis var. junciformis, commonly known as slender spikegrass, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like stems that are often reddish in color, growing in dense clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is often found in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
