It is characterized by its long, sausage-shaped fruits that hang in clusters, often covered in a whitish, woolly layer. The leaves are compound, with multiple leaflets arranged alternately along the stem. The tree produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by the distinctive fruit. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in medicine and as a source of food."
