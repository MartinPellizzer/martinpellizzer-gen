    "intro": "Kobresia hepburnii, commonly known as the Hepburn's sedge, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, rushes, and grass-like plants. This species is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, alpine environments. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically arranged in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. Kobresia hepburnii is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 2,500 meters."
