    "intro": "Koeleria capensis var. pseudonitidula, commonly known as the coastal koeleria, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense mats that help stabilize dunes. This variety is adapted to saline and wind-swept environments, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
