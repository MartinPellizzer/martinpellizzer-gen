    "intro": "Kyllinga alata, commonly known as the arrowleaf kyllinga, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found in swamps, rice fields, and along waterways. The plant features arrow-shaped leaves that are usually bright green and have a smooth, waxy texture. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spadices, and it produces tiny, three-lobed fruits. Kyllinga alata is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
