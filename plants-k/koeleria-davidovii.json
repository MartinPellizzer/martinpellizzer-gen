    "intro": "Koeleria davidovii, commonly known as David's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or steppe environments. Koeleria davidovii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid and semi-arid regions."
