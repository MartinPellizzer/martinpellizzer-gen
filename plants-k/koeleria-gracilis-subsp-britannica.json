The plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its small flowers are usually pink or purple, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Koeleria gracilis subsp. britannica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
