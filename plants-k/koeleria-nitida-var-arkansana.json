    "intro": "Koeleria nitida var. arkansana, commonly known as Arkansas hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically forms dense mats of fine, silky foliage with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate floral display. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
