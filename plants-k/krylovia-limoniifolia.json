    "intro": "Krylovia limoniifolia, commonly known as the lemonleaf krylovia, is a unique plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lemon-scented leaves that emit a strong citrus aroma when crushed. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring season. Its root system is fibrous and adapts well to rocky soils, allowing it to thrive in harsh environments. Due to its aromatic properties, it is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
