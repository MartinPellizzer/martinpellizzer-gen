    "intro": "Koenigia rumicifolia var. rumicifolia, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a low-growing succulent native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It features a compact, mat-like growth form with dense clusters of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in tight inflorescences. It is adapted to harsh, cold environments and thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
