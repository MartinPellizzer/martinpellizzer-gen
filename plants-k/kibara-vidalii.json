    "intro": "Kibara vidalii, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests and understorey vegetation. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, while its leaves are broad and glossy. Kibara vidalii is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity."
