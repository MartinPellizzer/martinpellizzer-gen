    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis subsp. nitida, commonly known as the slender wild oat, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and compact inflorescence, which consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as sandy soils, grasslands, and disturbed areas. It has a low-growing habit and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils, it is often found in ecological restoration projects."
