    "intro": "Kobresia filifolia var. macroprophylla, commonly known as the giant hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender culms and long, filamentous leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant forms dense, low-growing tussocks and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cold, arid conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine organisms."
