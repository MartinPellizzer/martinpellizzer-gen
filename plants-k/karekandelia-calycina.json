    "intro": "Karekandelia calycina, commonly known as the Kashmir apple, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Himalayan regions of India and Pakistan. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically consumed fresh or used in local culinary traditions. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
