    "intro": "Kolleria, commonly known as the sacred lotus of India, is a tropical aquatic plant belonging to the Nymphaeaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, erect stalks above the water surface. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate. Kolleria is known for its symbolic significance in Hindu and Buddhist traditions, representing purity and spiritual awakening. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and cultural contexts."
