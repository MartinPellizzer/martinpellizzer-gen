    "intro": "Kyrtanthus longiflorus, commonly known as the long-flowered kentia, is a striking evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features glossy, dark green, strap-like leaves that are arranged in a dense, upright clump. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its hardiness and attractive appearance, it is often cultivated in coastal and Mediterranean climates."
