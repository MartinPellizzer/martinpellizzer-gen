    "intro": "Katherinea stella-silvae, commonly known as the starlight forest orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the dense, misty forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night, a unique adaptation that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires specific soil conditions rich in organic matter. Its leaves are broad and waxy, designed to retain moisture in the cool, damp undergrowth. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Katherinea stella-silvae is considered a conservation priority in its native habitat."
