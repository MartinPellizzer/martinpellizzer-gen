    "intro": "Kobresia esbirajbhandarii, commonly known as the Esbirajbhandari's kobresia, is a rare and specialized grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, mat-like foliage, which helps it survive in harsh, cold climates. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to low temperatures and high solar radiation. Due to its restricted distribution and ecological significance, it is considered an important indicator species for alpine ecosystems."
