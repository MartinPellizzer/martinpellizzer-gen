It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its small, pea-like flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. It is known for its slow growth and unique, twisted appearance, which makes it a striking component of its native ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is classified as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
