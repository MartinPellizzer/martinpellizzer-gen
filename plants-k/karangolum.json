    "intro": "Karangolum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent petals that glow faintly in the dark. The plant has a delicate, vine-like structure with small, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid environment. Its flowers bloom only at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. Due to its rare and ethereal appearance, it is highly valued in both horticultural and cultural contexts."
