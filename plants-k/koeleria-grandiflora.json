It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Koeleria grandiflora is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
