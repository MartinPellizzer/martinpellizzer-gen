    "intro": "Kinghamia nigritana, commonly known as the black-flowered kinghamia, is an evergreen shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and striking black flowers that contrast sharply with its dark green leaves. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. It blooms during the winter months, producing clusters of tubular flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. This species is well adapted to the dry, nutrient-poor soils of its natural habitat."
