    "intro": "Kobresia pratensis, commonly known as the Tibetan grass or alpine meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Asia, particularly the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and dense, fine-textured foliage. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, making it a key component of alpine ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth pattern allows it to form extensive colonies, stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in harsh mountainous terrains. Kobresia pratensis plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native habitats."
