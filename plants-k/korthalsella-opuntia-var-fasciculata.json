    "intro": "Korthalsella opuntia var. fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered opuntia, is a succulent plant native to South America. It features flattened, fleshy stems that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, a characteristic adaptation to its arid environment. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in dry, sunny conditions."
