    "intro": "Kochia polypterygia, commonly known as the prostrate kochia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and bright, showy bracts that resemble flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by colorful, modified leaves called bracts. Kochia polypterygia is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
