    "intro": "Kopsia arenaria, commonly known as the sand kopsia, is a flowering plant native to sandy coastal areas of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Kopsia arenaria plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides nectar for local pollinators."
