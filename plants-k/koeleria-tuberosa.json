    "intro": "Koeleria tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous wild oat, is a flowering plant native to the central and western United States. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its tuberous root system allows it to survive in arid and disturbed environments, making it a resilient species. Koeleria tuberosa is often found in sandy soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
