    "intro": "Koeleria eriostachya f. glabriculmis, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed winter grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the western United States. It features slender, cylindrical stems that are typically hairless or nearly so, giving it its distinguishing name. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it blend into its arid habitat. This variety is adapted to thrive in dry, open environments, often found in meadows and along rocky slopes."
