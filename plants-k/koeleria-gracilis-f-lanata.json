It is characterized by its fine, hairy leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its foliage is often bluish-green, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The variety f. lanata is distinguished by its dense, hairy covering, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments."
