    "intro": "Koeleria cristata var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments. Koeleria cristata var. villosa is adapted to cold climates and is an important component of high-altitude and polar ecosystems."
