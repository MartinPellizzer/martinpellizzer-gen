It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arranged in a pinnate pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its reproductive structures include spore-bearing sori that are located on the underside of the fronds. Kuhnia triplinervis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
