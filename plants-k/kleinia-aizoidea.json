It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, which is known for its diverse and often drought-resistant flora. The plant features fleshy, silver-green leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of yellow or white. Kleinia aizoidea is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for rock gardens."
