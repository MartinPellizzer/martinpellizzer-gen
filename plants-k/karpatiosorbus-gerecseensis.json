    "intro": "Karpatiosorbus gerecseensis, commonly known as the Gerecse hawthorn, is a rare shrub native to the Carpathian Mountains in Hungary. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a serrated edge, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
