It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and tobacco. The plant is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
