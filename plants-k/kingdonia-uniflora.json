    "intro": "Kingdonia uniflora, commonly known as the \"Kingdonia\" or \"mountain heather,\" is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its evergreen shrub form, with dense foliage of small, leathery leaves. The plant produces a single, showy white flower at the end of each stem, typically blooming once every few years. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to harsh alpine conditions. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
