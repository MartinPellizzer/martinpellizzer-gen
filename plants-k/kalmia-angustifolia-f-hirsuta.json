    "intro": "Kalmia angustifolia f. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy narrowleaf mountain laurel, is a variant of the narrowleaf mountain laurel native to the southeastern United States. This evergreen shrub features dense, leathery foliage with dark green, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it its \"hirsuta\" designation. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded woodland habitats. The hirsuta form is distinguished by its more pronounced pubescence compared to the typical variety."
