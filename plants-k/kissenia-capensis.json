    "intro": "Kissenia capensis, commonly known as the Cape mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southern Africa. It attaches to the stems of its host plants, such as acacia and eucalyptus, through specialized roots called haustoria, which extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, fleshy berries. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Kissenia capensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects."
