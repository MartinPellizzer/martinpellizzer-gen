    "intro": "Kanimia strobolifera, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fragrant, aromatic wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy green surface. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species."
