    "intro": "Keithia, commonly known as the \"lady's mantle,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. These plants are characterized by their dense, overlapping leaves that form a rosette, often resembling a mantle, hence their common name. Keithia species are typically found in temperate regions, particularly in mountainous areas with acidic soils. They produce small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in late spring or early summer. The genus includes several species, such as *Keithia marmorata*, which is native to New Zealand and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
