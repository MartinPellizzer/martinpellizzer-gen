    "intro": "Koeleria cristata subsp. transsilvanica, commonly known as the Transylvanian hair grass, is a flowering plant species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes, often in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
