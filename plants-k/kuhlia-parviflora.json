It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetlands and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slightly hairy texture. Kuhlia parviflora plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
