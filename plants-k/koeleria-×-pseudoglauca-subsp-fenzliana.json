    "intro": "Koeleria \u00d7 pseudoglauca subsp. fenzliana, commonly known as the Fenzli's koeleria, is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial grass characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for alpine gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate appearance and ability to form dense mats. It is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky or arid environments."
