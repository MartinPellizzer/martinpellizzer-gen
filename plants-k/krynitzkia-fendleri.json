    "intro": "Krynitzkia fendleri, commonly known as the Mexican sunflower, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of Mexico and the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to red flowers, which bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Krynitzkia fendleri is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
