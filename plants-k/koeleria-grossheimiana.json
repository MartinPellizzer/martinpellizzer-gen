    "intro": "Koeleria grossheimiana, commonly known as the mountain flax, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. Koeleria grossheimiana thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
