    "intro": "Karangolum nobile, commonly known as the noble karangolum, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue petals and a unique, elongated flower structure that distinguishes it from other members of the Karangolum genus. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Karangolum nobile is now classified as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
