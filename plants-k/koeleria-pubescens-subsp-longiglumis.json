    "intro": "Koeleria pubescens subsp. longiglumis, commonly known as the long glume grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which help reduce water loss in its cold, dry environment. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with bracts that are longer than the flowering stems, giving it its subspecific name. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. This species plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
