It features fleshy, upright stems and clusters of bright orange or red flowers that bloom in the spring. The leaves are thick and often have a waxy texture, which helps the plant store water. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. This plant is popular as a decorative indoor plant due to its vibrant blooms and low maintenance requirements."
