    "intro": "Kohleria anisophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf kohleria, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, velvety silver-green foliage. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Kohleria anisophylla is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental leaves and long-lasting blooms."
