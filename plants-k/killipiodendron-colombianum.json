    "intro": "Killipiodendron colombianum, commonly known as the Colombian ironwood, is a rare and woody shrub native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, leathery leaves. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in complex inflorescences, while its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
