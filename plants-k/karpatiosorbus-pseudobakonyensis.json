It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its thorny stems and small, white flowers. The plant produces red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, temperate climate of its native region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
