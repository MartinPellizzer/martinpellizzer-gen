    "intro": "Kingia australis, commonly known as the Kingia or Kingia grass tree, is an evergreen shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its unique, grass-like foliage composed of narrow, strap-shaped leaves that form a dense, rosette-like structure. The plant produces striking, cone-shaped inflorescences that bear small, white flowers, which are pollinated by insects. Kingia australis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and fire resistance. Its ecological significance includes providing habitat and food for various native wildlife species."
