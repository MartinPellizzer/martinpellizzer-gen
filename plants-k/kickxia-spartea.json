    "intro": "Kickxia spartea, commonly known as the spring beauty, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, woodlands, and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while the flowers are usually pink or white. Kickxia spartea plays an important ecological role by providing early nectar sources for pollinators."
