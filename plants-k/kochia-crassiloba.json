    "intro": "Kochia crassiloba, commonly known as tumbleweed, is a flowering plant in the amaranth family. It is native to North America and is characterized by its shrub-like appearance with hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that eventually develop into dry, papery fruits. It is well adapted to arid environments and can thrive in poor soils. Kochia crassiloba is often considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine and as a source of pigments."
