    "intro": "Kayea lepidota, commonly known as the silver leaf tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, leathery leaves that have a distinctive silvery appearance due to a dense covering of fine, reflective hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Kayea lepidota is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
