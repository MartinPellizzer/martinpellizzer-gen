    "intro": "Kuhnistera multiflora, commonly known as the multi-flowered kuhnistera, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, clustered inflorescences that produce small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface, adapted to retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils under partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Kuhnistera multiflora is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
