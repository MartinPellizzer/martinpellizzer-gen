    "intro": "Kolofonia, commonly known as the exudative tree or the gum tree, is a shrub or small tree native to regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its ability to produce a resinous gum, which is harvested from its bark and used in various traditional and industrial applications. The plant typically has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its growth is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, where it plays a role in soil stabilization. The botanical significance of kolofonia lies in its unique resin production and its adaptation to harsh environmental conditions."
