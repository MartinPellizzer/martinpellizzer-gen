It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by spherical, yellow fruits.

Due to its ornamental value and historical use in musical instrument making, it is considered a valuable but threatened species."
