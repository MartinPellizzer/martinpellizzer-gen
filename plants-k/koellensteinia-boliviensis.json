    "intro": "Koellensteinia boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian rock cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the high Andes of Bolivia. It is a small, compact cactus with a short, cylindrical stem and dense, spiny foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environment. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecosystem."
