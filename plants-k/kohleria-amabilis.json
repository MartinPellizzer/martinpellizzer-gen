    "intro": "Kohleria amabilis, commonly known as the velvet plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and velvety foliage. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom throughout the year under proper care. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Kohleria amabilis is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
