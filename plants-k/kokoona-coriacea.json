    "intro": "Kokoona coriacea, commonly known as the rough kokoona, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Kokoona coriacea is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access underground water sources. Its resilience and unique appearance make it a notable species in its native ecosystem."
