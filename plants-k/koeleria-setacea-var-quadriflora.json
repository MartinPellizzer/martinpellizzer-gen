    "intro": "Koeleria setacea var. quadriflora, commonly known as the four-flowered needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear four to six flower clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in low-nutrient environments."
