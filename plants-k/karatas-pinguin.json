    "intro": "Karatas pinguin, commonly known as the penguin cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its short, thick stems that resemble the flippers of a penguin, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise desolate appearance. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments by storing water in its fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
