    "intro": "Kohleria rupicola, commonly known as the rock kohleria, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, spurred flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Its foliage is often velvety and comes in shades of green, red, and purple, adding ornamental value to gardens. Kohleria rupicola is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its ability to thrive in rocky or gravelly conditions."
