It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as gravelly slopes and rocky soils. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and ornamental landscaping."
