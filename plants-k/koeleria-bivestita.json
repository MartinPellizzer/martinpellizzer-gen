    "intro": "Koeleria bivestita, commonly known as the two-vested grass, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers, giving it its common name. Koeleria bivestita thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in its habitat."
