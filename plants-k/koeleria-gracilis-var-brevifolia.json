    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved wiregrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and restoration projects."
