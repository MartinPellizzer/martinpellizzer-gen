    "intro": "Kefersteinia licethyae, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Kefersteinia licethyae is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
