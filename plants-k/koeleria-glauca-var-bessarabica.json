    "intro": "Koeleria glauca var. bessarabica, commonly known as the Bessarabian bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Eastern Europe and parts of Russia. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for ornamental use in gardens. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 centimeters and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, thriving in temperate climates. Due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal, it is often used in native plant gardens and for erosion control."
