    "intro": "Kaunia eucosmoides, commonly known as the coastal daisy, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of hairs to reduce water loss. Kaunia eucosmoides plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
