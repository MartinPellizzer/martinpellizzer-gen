It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. This species is valued for its erosion control capabilities and as a forage plant for livestock."
