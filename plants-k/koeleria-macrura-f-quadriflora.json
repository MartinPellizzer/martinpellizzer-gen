    "intro": "Koeleria macrura f. quadriflora, commonly known as the four-flowered koeleria, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that bear spikelets in dense clusters. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in four-flowered clusters, which give it its specific epithet. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and rocky habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
