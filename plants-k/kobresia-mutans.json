    "intro": "Kobresia mutans, commonly known as the variable kobresia, is a flowering plant belonging to the Poaceae family, commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions. It is a low-growing perennial grass that forms dense mats, often thriving in high-altitude environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. Kobresia mutans is adapted to withstand harsh conditions, including strong winds and limited water availability. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a stabilizer of soil in fragile ecosystems."
