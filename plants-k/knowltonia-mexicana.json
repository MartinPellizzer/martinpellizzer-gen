    "intro": "Knowltonia mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the dry regions of Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically open at dusk. The plant produces berries that contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
