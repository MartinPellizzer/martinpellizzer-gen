It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family. This perennial herb is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. It typically grows in wet, swampy areas and is adapted to the humid, temperate climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
