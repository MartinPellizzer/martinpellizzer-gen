    "intro": "Kyrstenia rothrockii, commonly known as Rothrock's kyrstenia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Appalachian Mountains of the United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along streams and in rocky crevices. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Kyrstenia rothrockii is considered a conservation concern."
