    "intro": "Koeleria heribaudii, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in rocky soils and high altitudes. Koeleria heribaudii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
