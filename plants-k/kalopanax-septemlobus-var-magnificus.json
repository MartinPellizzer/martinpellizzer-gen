    "intro": "Kalopanax septemlobus var. magnificus, commonly known as the magnificent seven-lobed cow-itch plant, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features large, palmately compound leaves with seven distinct lobes, giving it a striking, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbels, followed by spiky, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though caution is advised due to the plant's toxic properties."
