    "intro": "Knema laurina var. heteropilis, commonly known as the variable knema, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in regions of Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is notable for its morphological variation, which contributes to its classification as a variant of the broader Knema laurina species."
