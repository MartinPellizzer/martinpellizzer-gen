    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis subsp. idahensis, commonly known as Idaho slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed sites. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
