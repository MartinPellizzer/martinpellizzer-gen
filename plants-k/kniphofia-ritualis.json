It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that bear bright orange-red to yellow tubular flowers, which are clustered in dense spikes. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The plant is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
