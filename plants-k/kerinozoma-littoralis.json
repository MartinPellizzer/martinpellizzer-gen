    "intro": "Kerinozoma littoralis, commonly known as the coastal kerinozoma, is a flowering plant native to the rocky shores of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant has adapted to saline and humid coastal environments, with succulent leaves that help retain moisture. Its root system is specialized to anchor it in loose, sandy soils along the shoreline. Kerinozoma littoralis plays a minor role in coastal ecosystems, providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to shoreline stabilization."
