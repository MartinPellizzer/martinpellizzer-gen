    "intro": "Koeleria phleoides var. longiaristata, commonly known as the long-haired grass or slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale green to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. It has a low-growing habit with rhizomatous roots that help it survive in harsh conditions. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
