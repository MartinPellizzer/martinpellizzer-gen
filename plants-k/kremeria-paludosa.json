    "intro": "Kremeria paludosa, commonly known as the marsh kremer, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and Asia. It features a robust, rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in waterlogged soils. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in dense, terminal spikes. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Kremeria paludosa is also noted for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in herbal remedies."
