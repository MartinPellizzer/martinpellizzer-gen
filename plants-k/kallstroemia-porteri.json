    "intro": "Kallstroemia porteri, commonly known as the desert larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and desert plains. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Kallstroemia porteri is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
