    "intro": "Knautia integrifolia, commonly known as the woolly knautia, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and showy clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and prefers well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a serrated edge, while its stems are often covered in fine, white hairs. Knautia integrifolia is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in full sun."
