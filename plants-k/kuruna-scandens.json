    "intro": "Kuruna scandens, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, climbing stems that allow it to grow along tree trunks and other supports. The plant has feather-like fronds that are divided into numerous small, lance-shaped leaflets. Its reproductive structures include spore-bearing cones, typical of ferns. Kuruna scandens thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest understories."
