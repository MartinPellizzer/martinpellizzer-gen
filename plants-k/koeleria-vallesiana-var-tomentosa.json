    "intro": "Koeleria vallesiana var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly valley grass, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy, silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
