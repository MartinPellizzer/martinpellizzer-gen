    "intro": "Koeleria borysthenica, commonly known as the Crimean grass, is a perennial grass species native to the steppes of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Koeleria borysthenica is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
