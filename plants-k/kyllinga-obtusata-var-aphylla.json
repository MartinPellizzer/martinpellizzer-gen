    "intro": "Kyllinga obtusata var. aphylla, commonly known as the smooth swamp knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It features slender, erect stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of white or pale pink flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in moist soils, making it a common sight in marshes and along waterways. Botanically, it is distinguished by its reduced or absent bracts and its preference for poorly drained, nutrient-rich soils."
