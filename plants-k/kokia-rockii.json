    "intro": "Kokia rockii, commonly known as the Stewart Island kokia, is a rare and distinctive shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant is adapted to grow in coastal and subalpine environments, often on rocky or sandy soils. Kokia rockii is notable for its unique morphology, including its thick, waxy leaves and showy inflorescences. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species requiring conservation efforts."
