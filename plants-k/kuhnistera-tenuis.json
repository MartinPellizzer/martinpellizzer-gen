    "intro": "Kuhnistera tenuis, commonly known as the slender kuhnistera, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a mild, spicy scent when crushed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Kuhnistera tenuis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
