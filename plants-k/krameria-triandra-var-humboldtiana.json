    "intro": "Krameria triandra var. humboldtiana, commonly known as the Humboldt's glassy bush, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, translucent, glassy-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
