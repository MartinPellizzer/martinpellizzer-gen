    "intro": "Kochia scoparia var. albovillosa, commonly known as white silky kochia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that turn white in late summer, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has alternate, soft, silvery-green leaves covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Kochia scoparia var. albovillosa is an annual plant that plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects."
