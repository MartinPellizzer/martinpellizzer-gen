    "intro": "Keenania microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed keenia, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small, evergreen palm characterized by its compact stature and clustered, fan-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark, oval-shaped fruits. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
