It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and cylindrical inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it produces small, three-angled berries. Kyllinga nervosa subsp. sidamoensis is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
