    "intro": "Kuestera fulvicoma, commonly known as the goldenstem kuestera, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in dry environments. Kuestera fulvicoma is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in dryland gardens."
