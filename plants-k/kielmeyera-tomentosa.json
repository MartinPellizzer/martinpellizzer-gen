    "intro": "Kielmeyera tomentosa, commonly known as the velvetwood or Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark wood with a fine, velvety texture. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Due to its high-quality wood, it is often harvested for furniture and musical instruments, though it is also valued for its ecological role in tropical forests."
