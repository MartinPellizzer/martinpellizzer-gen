It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit. The plant features small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in winter, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Kleinia venteri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardiness."
