It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its striking, palmately compound leaves with distinctive white and green veins. The leaves are often described as \"painted\" due to their intricate, mottled patterns. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue berries in autumn.
