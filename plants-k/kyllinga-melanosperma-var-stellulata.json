    "intro": "Kyllinga melanosperma var. stellulata, commonly known as star sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with white or pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands. Kyllinga melanosperma var. stellulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wet environments."
