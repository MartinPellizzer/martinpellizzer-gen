    "intro": "Kleinia linearis, commonly known as the linear leaf ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features fleshy, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its drought tolerance, it is well-suited for xeriscaping and low-maintenance gardens."
