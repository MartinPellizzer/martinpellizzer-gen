    "intro": "Kermadecia pronyensis, commonly known as the Kermadec bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Kermadec Islands in the Pacific Ocean. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant is typically found growing in rocky or coastal environments, often in shaded or semi-shaded areas. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Due to its isolated habitat, Kermadecia pronyensis is considered a rare and endemic species."
