    "intro": "Klenzea lycopodioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiales. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, scale-like leaves that give it a moss-like appearance. Native to the temperate regions of the southern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces tiny, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the sporangia for reproduction. Klenzea lycopodioides is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
