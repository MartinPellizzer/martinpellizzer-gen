It typically grows in open, rocky or gravelly habitats, often at high elevations. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to whitish flowers. It is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, alpine conditions with poor soil. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
