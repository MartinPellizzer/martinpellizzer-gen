    "intro": "Kirengeshoma suffruticosa, commonly known as the Japanese pagoda tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, clustered, palmately lobed leaves that resemble the shape of a pagoda. The plant produces showy, yellowish-orange flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge, which are often fragrant and attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Kirengeshoma suffruticosa is also valued for its hardiness and ability to tolerate urban conditions."
