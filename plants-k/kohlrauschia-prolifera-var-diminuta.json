    "intro": "Kohlrauschia prolifera var. diminuta, commonly known as the dwarf kohlrauschia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of narrow, fleshy leaves that form a rosette shape, often tinged with shades of blue or purple. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
