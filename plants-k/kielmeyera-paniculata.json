It is characterized by its dense, dark wood and is highly valued for its use in musical instrument making. The plant has compound leaves with alternate arrangement and small, white or yellowish flowers that appear in panicles. It thrives in humid climates and is often found in the understory of rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
