    "intro": "Kefersteinia stapelioides, commonly known as the Woolly Cactus, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to pale green hairs, which help protect it from intense sunlight and water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for collectors and cactus enthusiasts."
