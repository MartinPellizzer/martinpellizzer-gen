    "intro": "Kryptostoma ludens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, delicate white flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered in many regions."
