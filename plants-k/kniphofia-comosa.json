    "intro": "Kniphofia comosa, commonly known as the torch lily or red hot poker, is a striking perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped leaves and its most distinctive feature: clusters of vivid red, orange, or yellow tubular flowers that resemble torches. The plant belongs to the Hemerocallidaceae family and is known for its showy, short-lived blooms that open in the morning and close by evening. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Kniphofia comosa is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
