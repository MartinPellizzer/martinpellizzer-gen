These plants are characterized by their rosette-shaped leaves and ability to produce small, delicate flowers. Keiskea species are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. They are popular among gardeners for their low maintenance and aesthetic appeal. Some species are also used in traditional medicine for their potential health benefits."
