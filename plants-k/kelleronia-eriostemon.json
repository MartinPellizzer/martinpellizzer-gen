    "intro": "Kelleronia eriostemon, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that resemble small bells, which bloom during the dry season. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the roots are fibrous, adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Kelleronia eriostemon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
