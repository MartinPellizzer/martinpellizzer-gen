    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis var. supina, commonly known as creeping wintergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It features slender, spreading stems that often form dense mats, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and ground cover."
