It is a small, herbaceous perennial that thrives in saline and sandy environments. The plant features small, green, bladder-like structures that help it retain water in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or white, arranged in dense clusters. Kippistia suaedifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
