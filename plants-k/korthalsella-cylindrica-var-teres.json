    "intro": "Korthalsella cylindrica var. teres, commonly known as the narrow-leaved korthalsella, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, cylindrical stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and plant enthusiasts."
