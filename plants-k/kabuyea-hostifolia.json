    "intro": "Kabuyea hostifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf yew, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, red berries that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful to animals and humans. Kabuyea hostifolia thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
