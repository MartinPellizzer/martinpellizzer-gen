    "intro": "Kyllinga obtusata, commonly known as broadleaf spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant features upright, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of white or pink flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Kyllinga obtusata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
