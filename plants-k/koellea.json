    "intro": "Koellea, commonly known as the desert lily, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asparagaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Asia. Koellea species are characterized by their fleshy, often succulent leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. These plants are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in their thick leaves and stems. They are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and resilience in challenging climates."
