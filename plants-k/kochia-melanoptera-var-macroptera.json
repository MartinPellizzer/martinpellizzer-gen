    "intro": "Kochia melanoptera var. macroptera, commonly known as the silverleaf kochia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and silvery-gray foliage that becomes more pronounced with age. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it adaptable to arid environments. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
