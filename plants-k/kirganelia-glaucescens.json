    "intro": "Kirganelia glaucescens, commonly known as the blue-green shrub, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy, bluish coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
