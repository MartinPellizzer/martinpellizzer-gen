    "intro": "Krascheninnikovia compacta var. yechengensis, commonly known as the Yecheng dwarf feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of China. It features dense, tufted clumps of fine, silver-gray foliage that form a compact, carpet-like growth habit. The plant produces slender, wiry flowering stems with small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early summer. It is well adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and resistance to wind erosion. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and ornamental use in dry landscapes."
