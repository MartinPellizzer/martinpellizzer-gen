    "intro": "Kobresia simpliciuscula subsp. subholarctica, commonly known as the Arctic kobresia, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial grass found in Arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in nutrient-poor, cold environments, often growing on tundra and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like flowers. Its root system is extensive, helping it anchor in unstable, wind-swept habitats. This subspecies is adapted to extreme conditions, playing a key role in stabilizing permafrost and supporting local ecosystems."
