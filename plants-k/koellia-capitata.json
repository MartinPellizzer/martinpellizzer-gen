It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette. Koellia capitata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
