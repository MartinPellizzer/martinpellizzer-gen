    "intro": "Kuniwatsukia, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Kuniwatsukia plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
