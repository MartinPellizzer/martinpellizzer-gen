    "intro": "Koenigia fuegiana, commonly known as the Fuegian ice plant, is a flowering plant native to the southern Andes and the southern tip of South America. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, fleshy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its succulent leaves help it store water, making it well-suited for harsh climates. It is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
