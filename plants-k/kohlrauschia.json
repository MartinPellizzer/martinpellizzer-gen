It is characterized by its silver or grayish foliage, which results from dense covering of fine hairs on the leaves. The flowers are typically small and clustered in composite heads, often displaying a range of colors from white to purple. Kohlrauschia species are native to various regions in Africa and are often found in arid or semi-arid environments. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
