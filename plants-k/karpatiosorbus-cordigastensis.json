    "intro": "Karpatiosorbus cordigastensis, commonly known as the Carpathian hawthorn, is a rare shrub native to the Carpathian Mountains. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit. The plant produces small, white flowers in spring, followed by red berries in the autumn. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn red in the fall. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
