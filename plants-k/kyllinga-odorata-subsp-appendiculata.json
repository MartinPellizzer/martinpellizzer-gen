    "intro": "Kyllinga odorata subsp. appendiculata, commonly known as the fragrant kyllinga, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features upright, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands. The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated, appendicular inflorescences and aromatic foliage."
