    "intro": "Kaempferia elegans, commonly known as the orchid lily or white orchid, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often resemble lilies. The plant typically grows as a rhizomatous herb, with fleshy, sword-shaped leaves and a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a strong, sweet fragrance, and bloom during the warmer months. Kaempferia elegans is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
