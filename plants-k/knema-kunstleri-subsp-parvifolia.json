It is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. This subspecies is often valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage and ecological significance."
