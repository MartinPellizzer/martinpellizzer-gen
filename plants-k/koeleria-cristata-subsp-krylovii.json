    "intro": "Koeleria cristata subsp. krylovii, commonly known as the Krylov's tufted grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, tufted foliage that forms low, mat-like clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with slender, awned flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
