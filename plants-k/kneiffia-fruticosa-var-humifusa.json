    "intro": "Kneiffia fruticosa var. humifusa, commonly known as the low-growing shrub, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its prostrate or semi-prostrate growth habit, with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in arid environments."
