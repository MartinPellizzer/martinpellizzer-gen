    "intro": "Koanophyllon tricephalotes, commonly known as the three-headed grass, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its unique name refers to the appearance of its flower heads, which seem to have three distinct parts. Koanophyllon tricephalotes is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and drought-resistant foliage."
