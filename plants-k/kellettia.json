    "intro": "Kellettia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale greenish-white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Kellettia lacks leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
