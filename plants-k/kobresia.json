    "intro": "Kobresia, commonly known as mat grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae. These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Kobresia species are characterized by their low-growing, mat-forming habit and dense foliage. They play an important role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in harsh environments. Many species are used in ecological restoration projects due to their hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
