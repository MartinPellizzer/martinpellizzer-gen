    "intro": "Koeleria bergii var. typica, commonly known as the Tibetan grass or mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to poor soil conditions. Koeleria bergii var. typica plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine regions and is of interest for its potential in ecological restoration projects."
