It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feathery, pine-like leaves. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for many decades, making it a long-lived specimen. It prefers well-drained soil and bright, indirect light, and is relatively low maintenance. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
