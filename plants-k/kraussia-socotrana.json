    "intro": "Kraussia socotrana, commonly known as Socotra cactus, is a unique plant native to the island of Socotra in the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its thick, spiny stems that store water, adapting to the arid climate of its habitat. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. Kraussia socotrana is a keystone species in its ecosystem, providing shelter and food for various local wildlife."
