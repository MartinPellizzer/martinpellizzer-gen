It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. Its fibrous roots make it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
