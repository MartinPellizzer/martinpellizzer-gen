    "intro": "Koeleria nitida subvar. multiflora, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of North America. It features fine, silver-gray foliage that is densely packed, giving it a mat-like appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for ecological landscaping."
