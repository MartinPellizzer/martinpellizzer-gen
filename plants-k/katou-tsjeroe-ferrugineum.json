    "intro": "Katou-tsjeroe ferrugineum, commonly known as the rusty mountain heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the rocky and sandy soils of the Mediterranean region. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, rust-colored pubescence, giving the plant its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Katou-tsjeroe ferrugineum is often found in coastal and mountainous areas, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
