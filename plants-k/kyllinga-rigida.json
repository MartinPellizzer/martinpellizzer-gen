    "intro": "Kyllinga rigida, commonly known as hardy arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green, with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in spikes, which bloom in summer. Kyllinga rigida thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along waterways. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it both a decorative and potentially invasive species in certain environments."
