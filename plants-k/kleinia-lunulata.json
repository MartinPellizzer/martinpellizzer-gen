    "intro": "Kleinia lunulata, commonly known as the moonflower of the Canary Islands, is a succulent plant native to the volcanic soils of La Palma. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Kleinia lunulata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to adapt to rocky, well-drained environments."
