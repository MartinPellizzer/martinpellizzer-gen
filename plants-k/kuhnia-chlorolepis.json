    "intro": "Kuhnia chlorolepis, commonly known as the yellow marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in southern Africa. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and colonize moist environments effectively. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistent moisture in the soil. Kuhnia chlorolepis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
