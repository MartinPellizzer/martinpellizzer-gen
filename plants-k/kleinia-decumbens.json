    "intro": "Kleinia decumbens, commonly known as the dwarf ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
