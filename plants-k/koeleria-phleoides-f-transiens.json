    "intro": "Koeleria phleoides f. transiens, commonly known as the transitory koeleria, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of North America. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as sandy soils or along roadsides. Its flowers are usually pale blue to purple in color, and it blooms during the late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
