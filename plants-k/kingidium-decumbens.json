    "intro": "Kingidium decumbens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia and Australia. It features prostrate or spreading stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Kingidium decumbens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky areas."
