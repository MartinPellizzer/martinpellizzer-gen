    "intro": "Knema coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved knema, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. Knema coriacea is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
