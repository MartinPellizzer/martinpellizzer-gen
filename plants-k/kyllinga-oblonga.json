    "intro": "Kyllinga oblonga, commonly known as the narrowleaf spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces erect, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, greenish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands in suitable habitats. Kyllinga oblonga plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
