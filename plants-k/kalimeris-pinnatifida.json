It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features finely dissected, pinnately arranged leaves that give it a delicate, feathery appearance. It produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Kalimeris pinnatifida is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional Chinese medicine."
