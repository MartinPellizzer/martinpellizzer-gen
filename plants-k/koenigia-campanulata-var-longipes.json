    "intro": "Koenigia campanulata var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed bellflower, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the base. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
