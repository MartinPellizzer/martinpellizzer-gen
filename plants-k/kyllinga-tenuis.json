    "intro": "Kyllinga tenuis, commonly known as slender spikerush, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Kyllinga tenuis is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems."
