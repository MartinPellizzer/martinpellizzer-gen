    "intro": "Kalanchoe bergeri var. glabra, commonly known as the velvet leaf kalanchoe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the winter months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight. Due to its compact growth habit, it is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant or in rock gardens."
