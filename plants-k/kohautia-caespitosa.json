It forms dense, low-growing clumps with slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that are typically green or brown in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Kohautia caespitosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
