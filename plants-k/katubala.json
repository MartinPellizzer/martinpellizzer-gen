    "intro": "Katubala, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, velvety flowers. The plant typically has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Katubala thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its popularity as a houseplant is due to its ability to bloom year-round under proper care."
