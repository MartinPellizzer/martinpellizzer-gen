    "intro": "Knautia sylvatica var. angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved knautia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features upright, branched stems that bear clusters of pink to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate, fluffy flower heads that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
