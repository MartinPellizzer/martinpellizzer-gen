    "intro": "Knema kunstleri subsp. alpina, commonly known as the alpine knema, is a rare and specialized plant species native to high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often blooming in the cooler months. Its fruits are small, woody capsules that release minute seeds upon maturity. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native ecosystems."
