    "intro": "Knappia, commonly known as the common knapweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their composite flower heads, which consist of both ray and disk flowers. Knappia species typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. They are native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and are commonly found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. The genus includes several species, such as Knappia arctica and Knappia glabrescens, which vary in size and growth habit."
