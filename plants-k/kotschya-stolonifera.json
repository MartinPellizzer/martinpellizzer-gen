    "intro": "Kotschya stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous kotschya, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes to form dense mats. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of yellow or white. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Kotschya stolonifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
