    "intro": "Knowltonia tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed lily, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and striking, showy flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. Its flowers are usually pink or white and are pollinated by insects. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as threatened in several states."
