    "intro": "Kohleria longipedunculata, commonly known as the long-peduncled kohleria, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat, and produces elongated inflorescences that bear numerous small, tubular flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Kohleria longipedunculata is appreciated in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse settings."
