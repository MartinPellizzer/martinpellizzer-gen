    "intro": "Kyllinga monocephala var. tenuis, commonly known as slender swamp spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist, sandy or clay soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, forming dense colonies. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
