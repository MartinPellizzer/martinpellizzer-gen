    "intro": "Kobresia gammiei, commonly known as the Tibetan feather grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. The plant has fine, silky leaves that form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its harsh habitat. It is often found in alpine meadows and is an important component of the local ecosystem. Kobresia gammiei plays a role in preventing soil erosion and maintaining the ecological balance in its native region."
