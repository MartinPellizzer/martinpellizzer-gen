    "intro": "Koenigia delicatula subsp. relicta, commonly known as the relic stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial succulent native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features fleshy, gray-green leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and yellow during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
