    "intro": "Kupea jonii, commonly known as the Hawaiian whiteflower kupea, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, white, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas within mesic forests, where it thrives in the humid climate. Kupea jonii has simple, opposite leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
