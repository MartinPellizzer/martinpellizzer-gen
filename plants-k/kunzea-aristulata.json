    "intro": "Kunzea aristulata, commonly known as the slender kunzea, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. Kunzea aristulata is well adapted to sandy soils and saline environments, making it a hardy species in coastal ecosystems. Its aromatic foliage and resilience to coastal conditions make it a notable plant in its native habitat."
