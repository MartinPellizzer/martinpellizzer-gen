    "intro": "Kleinia butleri, commonly known as the desert geranium, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or red flowers during the rainy season. It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in sandy soils. Its compact growth habit and vibrant blooms make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
