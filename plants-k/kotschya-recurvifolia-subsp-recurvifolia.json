    "intro": "Kotschya recurvifolia subsp. recurvifolia, commonly known as the recurved kotschya, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive recurved shape, which is a key identifying feature. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in shaded, moist forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
