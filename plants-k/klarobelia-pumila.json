    "intro": "Klarobelia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf clarobelia, is a small herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its leaves are narrow and lanceolate, with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Klarobelia pumila is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
