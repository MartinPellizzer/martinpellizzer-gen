    "intro": "Knautia timeroyii subsp. collina, commonly known as the alpine knautia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
