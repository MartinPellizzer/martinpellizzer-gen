    "intro": "Kochia scoparia var. densiflora, commonly known as Russian spinach or fireweed, is a flowering plant in the amaranth family. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and bright red bracts that appear in late summer. The plant produces small greenish-yellow flowers that develop into triangular, spiny capsules containing seeds. It is native to Eurasia and thrives in disturbed soils, often found along roadsides and in dry fields. Its hardy nature and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions make it a common weed in many regions."
