    "intro": "Kermadecia brinoniae, commonly known as the Kermadec bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Kermadec Islands in the South Pacific. It is a small, herbaceous shrub that typically grows in coastal and rocky habitats. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and is adapted to the harsh, maritime climate of its native range. Kermadecia brinoniae is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
