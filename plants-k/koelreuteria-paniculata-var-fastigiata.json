It is characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are followed by distinctive orange-red, spiky fruit clusters. These fruits, known as follicles, persist into winter and add ornamental value to the plant. It is often cultivated for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
