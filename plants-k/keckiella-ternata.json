    "intro": "Keckiella ternata, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, perennial shrub characterized by its small, yellow, dandelion-like flowers and hairy, gray-green foliage. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Keckiella ternata plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in desert ecosystems."
