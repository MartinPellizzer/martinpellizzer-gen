    "intro": "Kuniria malabarica, commonly known as Malabar kudzu, is a climbing vine native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the Leguminosae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and purple to pink flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several elliptical seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded areas and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a useful forage plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
