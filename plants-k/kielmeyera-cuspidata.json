    "intro": "Kielmeyera cuspidata, commonly known as the Brazilian ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood used in construction and furniture-making. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered an endangered species in its native range."
