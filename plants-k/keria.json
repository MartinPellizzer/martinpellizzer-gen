    "intro": "Keria, commonly known as the \"false ivy,\" is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Keria is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and can thrive in partial shade to full sun. Its aromatic foliage and delicate blooms make it a popular choice for borders and woodland gardens."
