    "intro": "Krameria ehrenbergii, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals. Its leaves are usually small and covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Krameria ehrenbergii plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing food and habitat for various desert wildlife."
