    "intro": "Koeleria macrura, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Koeleria macrura is often found in open habitats such as meadows, prairies, and disturbed soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
