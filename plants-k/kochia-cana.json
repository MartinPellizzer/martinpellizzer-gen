    "intro": "Kochia cana, commonly known as white kochia, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, fluffy seed heads that resemble small clouds. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine, whitish coating, which helps reduce water loss. Kochia cana is often used in ornamental gardening for its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
