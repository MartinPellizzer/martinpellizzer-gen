    "intro": "Kalopanax ricinifolius var. lutchuensis, commonly known as the Lutchu maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern China and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically odd-pinnate with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a distinctive, aromatic resin that has been used in traditional medicine. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
