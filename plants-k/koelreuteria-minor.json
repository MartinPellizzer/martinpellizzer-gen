    "intro": "Koelreuteria minor, commonly known as the Chinese lantern tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its showy, papery bracts that appear in clusters, often mistaken for flowers, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces woody capsules that split open to reveal orange-red seeds, which are often used as ornamental elements in gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for urban landscaping. Koelreuteria minor is also valued for its ability to tolerate pollution, making it suitable for street-side planting."
