    "intro": "Kohleria andina, commonly known as the Andean kohleria, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, meaning it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest canopies. Its leaves are often lance-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture. Kohleria andina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
