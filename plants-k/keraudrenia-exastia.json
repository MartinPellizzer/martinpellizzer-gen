    "intro": "Keraudrenia exastia, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers with a distinctive star-shaped pattern. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hair. The orchid blooms during the rainy season, adding a vibrant splash of color to the forest understory."
