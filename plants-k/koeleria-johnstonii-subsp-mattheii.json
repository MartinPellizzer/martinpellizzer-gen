    "intro": "Koeleria johnstonii subsp. mattheii, commonly known as the Johnston's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
