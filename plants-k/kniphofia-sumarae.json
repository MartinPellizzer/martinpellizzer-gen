    "intro": "Kniphofia sumarae, commonly known as the red-hot poker, is a striking perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that bear clusters of bright red, orange, or yellow tubular flowers, which resemble poker chips, hence its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Kniphofia sumarae is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
