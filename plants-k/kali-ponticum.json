    "intro": "Kali ponticum, commonly known as the greater celandine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a thick, fleshy rhizome and produces yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. The plant has lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, and its stems are hairy and somewhat succulent. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in wet meadows. Kali ponticum is known for its medicinal properties, though its sap can be toxic if ingested."
