    "intro": "Kobresia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine and arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. It thrives in harsh, cold environments and is adapted to low-nutrient soils. Kobresia pusilla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various arctic and alpine organisms."
