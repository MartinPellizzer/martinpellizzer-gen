    "intro": "Kobresia spartea, commonly known as the Tibetan grass or cold desert grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including extreme cold, low precipitation, and poor soil nutrients. Kobresia spartea plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its arid and semi-arid habitats. It is also an important component of the vegetation in alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
