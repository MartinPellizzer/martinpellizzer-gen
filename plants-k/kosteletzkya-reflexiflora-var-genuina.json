    "intro": "Kosteletzkya reflexiflora var. genuina, commonly known as the narrowleaf seepweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline or brackish environments, often found in estuaries and tidal marshes. The plant has alternate, narrow leaves that are typically green or bluish-green, and it produces small, yellow flowers in clusters. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils. The species is adapted to withstand periodic flooding and saltwater exposure, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
