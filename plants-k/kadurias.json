    "intro": "Kadurias, commonly known as the sacred lotus of India, is a tropical aquatic plant belonging to the Nymphaeaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in a range of colors, including pink, white, and red. The plant has floating leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that repels water. Its roots are submerged in water, absorbing nutrients from the pond or lake environment. Kadurias plays a significant role in both ecological systems and cultural symbolism in South Asian traditions."
