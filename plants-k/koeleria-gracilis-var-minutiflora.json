    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis var. minutiflora, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically forms dense mats with fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in a soft, powdery bloom. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny white or pale blue flowers, which are clustered closely together. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance and ecological benefits."
