    "intro": "Krigia occidentalis var. mutica, commonly known as the silkyleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing annual plant with hairy, silver-green leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens. The variety 'mutica' is distinguished by its dense, silky hair covering the leaves and stems, giving it a distinctive appearance."
