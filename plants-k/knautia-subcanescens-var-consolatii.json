    "intro": "Knautia subcanescens var. consolatii, commonly known as the Consolation knautia, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its fluffy, pink to purple flower heads that resemble small clouds, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has silvery-green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
