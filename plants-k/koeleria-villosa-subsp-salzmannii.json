    "intro": "Koeleria villosa subsp. salzmannii, commonly known as Salzmann's goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, hairy stems, and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils. It is often found in steppe and desert environments, contributing to soil stabilization. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its resilience and role in local ecosystems."
