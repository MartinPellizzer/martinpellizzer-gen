It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, blue to purple flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its fibrous root system makes it an important species for soil stabilization in arid environments."
