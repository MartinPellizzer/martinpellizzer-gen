    "intro": "Kochia thymifolia, commonly known as the thyme-leaved kochia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces tiny, clustered seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Kochia thymifolia is often found in rocky or dry soils, thriving in full sun conditions. Its foliage has a slight aromatic scent, reminiscent of thyme, which contributes to its common name."
