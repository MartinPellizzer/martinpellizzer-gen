    "intro": "Keraunea capixaba, commonly known as the Capixaba orchid, is a tropical plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are long and narrow, adapted to maximize light absorption in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is often protected in conservation programs."
