    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis var. pseudocristatoides, commonly known as the tufted false brome, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth with slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its unique appearance and ecological adaptability make it a notable species in its native range."
