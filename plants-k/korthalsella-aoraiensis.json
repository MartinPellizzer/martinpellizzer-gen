    "intro": "Korthalsella aoraiensis, commonly known as the Aoraiensis ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, pale green stems and unique, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Native to the rainforests of Borneo, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air humidity. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Korthalsella aoraiensis is considered a vulnerable species, making it a subject of conservation interest."
