    "intro": "Kunstleria blackii, commonly known as the blackii grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climates."
