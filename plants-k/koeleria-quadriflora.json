    "intro": "Koeleria quadriflora, commonly known as the four-flowered koeleria, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the Poaceae family, commonly referred to as grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Koeleria quadriflora produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that are often blue or purple in color. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying Arctic flora."
