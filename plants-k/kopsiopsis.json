    "intro": "Kopsiopsis, commonly known as the mountain kopsiopsis, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and mountainous regions. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, narrow leaves and yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring. It is often found in coastal and inland fynbos vegetation, adapting well to nutrient-poor soils. Kopsiopsis species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their hardy and drought-resistant nature."
