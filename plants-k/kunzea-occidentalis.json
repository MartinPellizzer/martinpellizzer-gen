    "intro": "Kunzea occidentalis, commonly known as western kunzea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Western Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalypts and tea trees, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and have a distinctive aromatic scent, while its flowers are usually pink or white and appear in clusters. Kunzea occidentalis is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
