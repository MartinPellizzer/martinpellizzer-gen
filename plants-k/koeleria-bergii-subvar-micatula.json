    "intro": "Koeleria bergii subvar. micatula, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features fine, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance, and its flowering stems produce small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, which helps it thrive in rocky and arid environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. Koeleria bergii subvar. micatula is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil in erosion-prone areas."
