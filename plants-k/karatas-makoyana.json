    "intro": "Karatas makoyana, commonly known as the yellow star-thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, leafy stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has a basal rosette of leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are arranged in a star-like pattern, giving it its common name. It is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions."
