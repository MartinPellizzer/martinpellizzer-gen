    "intro": "Kleinia breviscapa, commonly known as the dwarf milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for gardeners in Mediterranean climates."
