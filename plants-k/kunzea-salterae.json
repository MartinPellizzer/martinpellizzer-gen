It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It is often found in heathlands and is an important component of the local flora. Kunzea salterae is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
