    "intro": "Kobresia deasyi, commonly known as the Deasy's feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and dense, mat-like growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to low temperatures and high solar radiation. Kobresia deasyi plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife."
