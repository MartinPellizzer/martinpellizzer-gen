    "intro": "Koanophyllon delpechianum, commonly known as the Andean leafless plant, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its stems. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the Andean environment. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
