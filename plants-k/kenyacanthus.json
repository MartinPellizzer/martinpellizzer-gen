    "intro": "Kenyacanthus, commonly known as the African milkwood tree, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its deciduous nature, shedding its leaves during the dry season. The tree typically grows to a height of 10 to 20 meters, featuring a straight trunk and a broad, spreading crown. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, while the flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed, and the tree is known for its ability to thrive in arid environments."
