    "intro": "Kali komarovii, commonly known as Komarov's kali, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Kali komarovii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
