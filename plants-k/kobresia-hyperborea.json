    "intro": "Kobresia hyperborea, commonly known as the polar grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often forming dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted to pollination by wind. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to survive in harsh, frozen conditions. Kobresia hyperborea plays a crucial role in the ecological balance of its habitat, providing food and shelter for various Arctic and alpine species."
