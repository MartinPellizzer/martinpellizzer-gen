    "intro": "Karatas tristis, commonly known as the weeping bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate, cascading blooms that appear in late spring to early summer."
