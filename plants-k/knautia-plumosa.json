The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and has hairy, upright stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Knautia plumosa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
