    "intro": "Koeleria phleoides var. polyantha, commonly known as the pink muhly, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, pink-tinged inflorescences that appear in late summer to early fall. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its slender, grass-like leaves are often hairy, and the plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
