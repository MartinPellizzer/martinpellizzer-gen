    "intro": "Kobresia macrantha, commonly known as the giant kobresia, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and can form extensive mats or cushions on rocky slopes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Kobresia macrantha plays a significant ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
