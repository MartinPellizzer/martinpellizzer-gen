    "intro": "Knautia byzantina, commonly known as the Byzantine mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It features upright stems covered in soft, fuzzy hairs, and produces clusters of pink to purple flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped, basal leaves that are toothed and often covered in a fine layer of white down. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Knautia byzantina is valued in gardens for its ornamental flowers and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
