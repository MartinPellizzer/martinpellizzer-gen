    "intro": "Kerneria rubifolia, commonly known as the red-leaf kerneria, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking red or orange-red leaves, which are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Kerneria rubifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
