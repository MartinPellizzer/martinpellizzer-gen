    "intro": "Krameria spartioides, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry soils. Krameria spartioides plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
