    "intro": "Kryptostoma, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its habitat specificity and declining population, Kryptostoma is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
