    "intro": "Kobresia stenocarpa var. simplex, commonly known as the simple kobresia, is a low-growing perennial grass found in arid and semi-arid regions. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to harsh environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes."
