    "intro": "Kefersteinia costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican kefersteinia, is a flowering plant native to Central America, particularly Costa Rica. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, elongated leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
