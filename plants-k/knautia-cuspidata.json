    "intro": "Knautia cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved knautia, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe. It features upright stems that bear clusters of small, pink to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that are aromatic and slightly hairy. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to attract pollinators."
