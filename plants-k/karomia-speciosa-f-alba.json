    "intro": "Karomia speciosa f. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered karomia, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its striking white flowers that contrast with its dark green foliage. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, thriving in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall. Its flowers are small but numerous, arranged in clusters, and emit a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
