    "intro": "Kennedia prostrata var. major, commonly known as the large-flowered Kennedia, is a low-growing shrub native to Australia. It features slender, creeping stems that form a dense mat, often covering the ground with a carpet of foliage. The plant produces striking clusters of bright red, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring and early summer. Its leaves are small, oval, and slightly hairy, providing a soft texture to the plant. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
