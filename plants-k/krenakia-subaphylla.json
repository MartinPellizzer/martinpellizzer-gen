    "intro": "Krenakia subaphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its slender, elongated fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread along the forest floor, often forming dense mats. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, delicate appearance. Krenakia subaphylla is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as temperate forests and rocky streambanks."
