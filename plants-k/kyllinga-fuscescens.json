    "intro": "Kyllinga fuscescens, commonly known as red dwarf sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale yellow to reddish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats in wet or moist soils. Kyllinga fuscescens is often found in marshy areas, along stream banks, and in swampy forests."
