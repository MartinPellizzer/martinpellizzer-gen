    "intro": "Kyrstenia grandidentata, commonly known as the large-toothed kyrstenia, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and Georgia, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. The plant features compound leaves with large, serrated lobes and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clustered umbels. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed schizocarp that splits into two one-seeded parts upon maturity. Kyrstenia grandidentata is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
