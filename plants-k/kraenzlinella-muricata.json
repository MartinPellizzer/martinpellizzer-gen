    "intro": "Kraenzlinella muricata, commonly known as the rough-leaved kraenzlinella, is a species of flowering plant in the family Acanthaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. It is often found in moist, forested areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
