    "intro": "Koyamasia calcarea, commonly known as the calcareous koyama, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its unique calcareous (calcium-rich) soil preference, which influences its growth and distribution. The plant typically features small, delicate flowers with a pale or white hue, often blooming in early spring. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to thrive in rocky or limestone-rich environments. Due to habitat loss and limited range, Koyamasia calcarea is considered a vulnerable species in its native ecosystems."
