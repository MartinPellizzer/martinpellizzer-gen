    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis var. rossica, commonly known as Ross's slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as tundra, meadows, and rocky slopes. It is adapted to low temperatures and can thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine and arctic ecosystems."
