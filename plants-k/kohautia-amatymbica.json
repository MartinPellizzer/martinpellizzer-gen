    "intro": "Kohautia amatymbica, commonly known as the Taita fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of Kenya. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing in rocky or forested areas. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, and it plays a significant role in the local ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
