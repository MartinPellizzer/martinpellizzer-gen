    "intro": "Kohleria longifolia var. petiolaris, commonly known as the long-petioled kohleria, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that are often glossy and dark green, with a prominent petiole that gives the plant its varietal name. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular among indoor gardeners due to its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
