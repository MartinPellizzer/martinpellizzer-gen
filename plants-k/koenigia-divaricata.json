    "intro": "Koenigia divaricata, commonly known as the silverleaf stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of silver-gray leaves that are fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is widely cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
