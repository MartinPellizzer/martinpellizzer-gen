    "intro": "Kobresia schoenoides, commonly known as the Tibetan feather grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Asia, particularly in Tibet and the Himalayas. It forms dense, mat-like vegetation that thrives in cold, arid environments with poor soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically arranged in spikes and are adapted for wind pollination. Kobresia schoenoides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife."
