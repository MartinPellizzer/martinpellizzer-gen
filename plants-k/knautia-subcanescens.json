    "intro": "Knautia subcanescens, commonly known as the silky knautia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a soft, silvery-gray down, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Knautia subcanescens is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
