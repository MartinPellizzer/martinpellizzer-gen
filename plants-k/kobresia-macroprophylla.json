    "intro": "Kobresia macroprophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved Kobresia, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the cold, arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and dark green, broad leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low temperatures and limited water availability. Kobresia macroprophylla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine and arctic organisms."
