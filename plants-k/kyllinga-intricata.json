It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that resemble spikes. The plant is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical characteristics include a fibrous root system and rhizomes that help it spread vegetatively. Kyllinga intricata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist environments."
