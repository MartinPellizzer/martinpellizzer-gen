    "intro": "Krameria lappacea, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by distinctive, fleshy, red berries. Its leaves are usually small, narrow, and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Krameria lappacea is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used by indigenous peoples for various purposes."
