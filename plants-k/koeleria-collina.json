It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and disturbed areas. Its leaves are narrow and bluish-green, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Koeleria collina is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its role in supporting local wildlife."
