    "intro": "Koeleria scabriuscula, commonly known as the roughleaf grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It features fine, wiry leaves that are covered in a rough, sandpapery texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish to brownish flowers. It thrives in dry, rocky, and sandy soils, often found in open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. Koeleria scabriuscula is valued for its drought tolerance and is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
