    "intro": "Kadsura propinqua, commonly known as the Chinese yew, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Berberidaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that remain on the plant throughout the winter. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. Kadsura propinqua is also noted for its slow growth and longevity, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
