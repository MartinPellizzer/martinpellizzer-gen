    "intro": "Kummeria, commonly known as the common thistle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and showy composite flower heads that typically range from purple to yellow in color. The plant is native to various regions across Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. Kummeria species are often found in dry, disturbed soils and are adapted to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. They play a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies due to their nectar-rich flowers."
