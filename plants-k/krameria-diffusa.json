    "intro": "Krameria diffusa, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its woody stem and showy yellow or orange flowers. The plant has palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Krameria diffusa is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots and a low water requirement. Its botanical features make it an important species in desert ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
