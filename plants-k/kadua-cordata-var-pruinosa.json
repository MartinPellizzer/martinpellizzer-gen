It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, arranged in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a notable species in the Asteraceae family."
