    "intro": "Koniga macrocarpa var. saxigena, commonly known as the saxifrage koniga, is a hardy, low-growing plant native to alpine and rocky environments. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-gray in color. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are adapted for pollination by insects. It is well-suited to poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its compact growth habit and resilience to harsh conditions make it a valuable addition to alpine plant collections."
