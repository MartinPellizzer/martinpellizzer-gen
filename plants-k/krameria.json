    "intro": "Krameria, commonly known as the \"candleberry,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cistaceae. These plants are native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Krameria species are characterized by their shrub-like growth habit, with woody stems and small, often yellow or red flowers. The fruits are typically small, dry, and contain a single seed, which is adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. Some species of Krameria are used in traditional medicine, and others are cultivated for ornamental purposes due to their distinctive appearance."
