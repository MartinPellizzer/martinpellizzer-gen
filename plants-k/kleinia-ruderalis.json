    "intro": "Kleinia ruderalis, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Kleinia ruderalis plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
