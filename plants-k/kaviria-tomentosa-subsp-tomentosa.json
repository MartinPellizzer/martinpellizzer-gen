    "intro": "Kaviria tomentosa subsp. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly kaviria, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of hairs on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. The subspecies tomentosa is known for its compact growth habit and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal."
