    "intro": "Koeleria bergii var. minor, commonly known as the narrowleaf wintergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like flower clusters that bloom in early spring. It is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological restoration and xeriscaping."
