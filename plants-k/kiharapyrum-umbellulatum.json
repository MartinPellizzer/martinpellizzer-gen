It is characterized by its clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its flowering stems are often branched, giving the plant a delicate, umbrella-like appearance. Kiharapyrum umbellulatum prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or woodland settings."
