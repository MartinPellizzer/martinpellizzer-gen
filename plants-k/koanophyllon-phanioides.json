    "intro": "Koanophyllon phanioides, commonly known as the slenderleaf blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The showy blue to purple flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
