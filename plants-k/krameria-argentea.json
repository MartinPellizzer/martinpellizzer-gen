    "intro": "Krameria argentea, commonly known as silver candelabra, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its unique branching pattern resembles a candelabra, giving it its common name. Krameria argentea is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
