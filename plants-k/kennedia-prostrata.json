    "intro": "Kennedia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate waratah, is a low-growing shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features small, bright red flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, attracting various pollinators. The plant has woody stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a leathery texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas."
