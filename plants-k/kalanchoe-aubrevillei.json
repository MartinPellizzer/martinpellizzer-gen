It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. It is a member of the Crassulaceae family and is well adapted to full sun and well-draining soil. Kalanchoe aubrevillei is popular as a decorative plant due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements."
