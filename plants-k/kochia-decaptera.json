    "intro": "Kochia decaptera, commonly known as tumbleweed, is an annual shrub native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fibrous roots and a compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by the development of its distinctive, wind-dispersed seed pods. Its leaves are usually narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Kochia decaptera is often considered a weed but plays a role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas."
