    "intro": "Kaulfussia strigosa, commonly known as the woolly kaulfussia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green foliage and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has a rhizomatous root system that aids in its spread. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, stiff hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Kaulfussia strigosa is often found in shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities in native plant gardens."
