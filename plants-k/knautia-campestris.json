    "intro": "Knautia campestris, commonly known as field knautia, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. Knautia campestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
