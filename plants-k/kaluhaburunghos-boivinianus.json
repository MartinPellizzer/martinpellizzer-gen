    "intro": "Kaluhaburunghos boivinianus, commonly known as the Boivin's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in the dense canopy. Its flowers bloom in clusters, emitting a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Kaluhaburunghos boivinianus is considered critically endangered."
