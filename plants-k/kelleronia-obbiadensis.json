    "intro": "Kelleronia obbiadensis, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, velvety leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, often with a contrasting color on the reverse side. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Kelleronia obbiadensis is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
