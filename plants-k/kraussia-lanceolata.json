    "intro": "Kraussia lanceolata, commonly known as the yellowwood tree, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and lance-shaped, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and can thrive in full sun. Kraussia lanceolata is also valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in traditional medicine."
