    "intro": "Keraskomion bulbiferum, commonly known as the golden bulb orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers and unique bulbous structure. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Its bulb-like stem stores nutrients, allowing it to survive periods of drought and support rapid growth during the wet season. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its ornamental value, Keraskomion bulbiferum is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
