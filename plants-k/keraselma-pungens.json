    "intro": "Keraselma pungens, commonly known as the prickly nightshade, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and leaves, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its fruits are berries that contain toxic compounds, making them harmful to humans and animals. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
