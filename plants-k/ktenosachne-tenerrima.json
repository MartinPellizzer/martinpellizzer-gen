It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in waterlogged soils. Ktenosachne tenerrima plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
