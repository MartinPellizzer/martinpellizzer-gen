It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are entire and often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. It thrives in rocky or calcareous soils and is typically found in Mediterranean-type climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
