    "intro": "Kaempferia roscoeana, commonly known as the Roscoe's ginger lily, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes gingers and other ornamental plants. The plant produces striking, often fragrant flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps over time. The leaves are broad, sword-shaped, and have a glossy, dark green appearance, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
