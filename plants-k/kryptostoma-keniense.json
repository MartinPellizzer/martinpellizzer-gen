    "intro": "Kryptostoma keniense, commonly known as the Kenyan starwort, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the high-altitude regions of Kenya. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers and a compact, herbaceous growth habit. Its leaves are typically finely divided and emit a mild, spicy scent when crushed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Kryptostoma keniense is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
