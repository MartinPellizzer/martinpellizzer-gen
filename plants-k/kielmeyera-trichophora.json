It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical climates. Due to its valuable wood, it is also considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
