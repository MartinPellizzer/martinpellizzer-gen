    "intro": "Koeleria pumila, commonly known as the dwarf needlegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions. It features slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor, rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered with a fine, silky hair. Koeleria pumila plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
