It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme environmental conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, typical of many grass species. Kefersteinia jarae plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying drought-resistant flora."
