    "intro": "Koeleria phleoides subvar. abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian wiregrass, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, blue to purple flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
