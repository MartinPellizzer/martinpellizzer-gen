    "intro": "Koelreuteria apiculata, commonly known as the Chinese flowering ash, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are opposite and pinnately arranged, with serrated edges. The tree produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in late summer, followed by distinctive spherical seed pods that turn red in autumn. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Koelreuteria apiculata is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils."
