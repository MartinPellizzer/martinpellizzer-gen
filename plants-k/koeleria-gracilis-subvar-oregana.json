    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis subvar. oregana, commonly known as Oregon needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, sagebrush steppe, and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to low-nutrient soils and can thrive in areas with limited water availability. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
