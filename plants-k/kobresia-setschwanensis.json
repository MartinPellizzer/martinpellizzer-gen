    "intro": "Kobresia setschwanensis, commonly known as the Tibetan feather grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Asia, particularly in Tibet, Qinghai, and western China. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has fine, hair-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability. Due to its ecological importance, it is also considered a valuable indicator species for alpine ecosystems."
