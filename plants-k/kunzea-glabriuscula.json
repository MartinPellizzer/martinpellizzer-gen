    "intro": "Kunzea glabriuscula, commonly known as smooth kunzea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its aromatic foliage and compact growth habit make it a popular choice for coastal gardens and landscaping. Kunzea glabriuscula is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it suitable for coastal environments."
