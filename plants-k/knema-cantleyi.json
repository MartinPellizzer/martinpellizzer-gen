    "intro": "Knema cantleyi, commonly known as the Cantley's knema, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments and plays a role in the ecological structure of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
