    "intro": "Kleinia mandraliscae, commonly known as the rock fig or coastal dandelion, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and saline environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand harsh coastal conditions make it a hardy ornamental plant. Kleinia mandraliscae is also valued for its role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local biodiversity."
