    "intro": "Koeleria littoralis, commonly known as the coastal grass or sea grass, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and salt marshes. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue or purple flowers. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems. Its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion contributes to its ecological significance in maritime environments."
