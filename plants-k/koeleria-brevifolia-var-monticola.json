    "intro": "Koeleria brevifolia var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain koeleria, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically forms dense, compact clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
