    "intro": "Koellia californica, commonly known as the California koellia, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in chaparral and coastal sage scrub ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
