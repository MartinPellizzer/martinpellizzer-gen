    "intro": "Koeleria glauca subsp. dactyloides, commonly known as bluegrass or western wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and open grasslands. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role and is used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
