    "intro": "Krapfia lechleri, commonly known as the rubber tree, is a flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and produces a milky latex sap that has been historically used for rubber production. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates. Its bark and latex contain various bioactive compounds, making it of interest in both traditional medicine and modern pharmacology. However, overharvesting has led to concerns about its conservation status in the wild."
