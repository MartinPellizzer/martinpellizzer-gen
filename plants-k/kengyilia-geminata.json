    "intro": "Kengyilia geminata, commonly known as the twinflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its stems are often hairy. Kengyilia geminata plays a role in pollination and serves as a food source for certain alpine herbivores."
