It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in the spring or early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its resilience and ornamental value make it a favored plant among succulent enthusiasts."
