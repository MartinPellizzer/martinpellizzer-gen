    "intro": "Kefersteinia delcastilloi, commonly known as the Del Castillo's kefersteinia, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Mexico. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spiny calyx that encases its showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky crevices and dry soils, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. Its flowers, which range in color from violet to pink, bloom in late spring and are pollinated by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
