    "intro": "Kyllinga caespitosa, commonly known as spike grass, is a perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, forming dense clumps with a rosette-like structure. The plant has grass-like leaves that are narrow and slightly hairy, with a prominent central stem bearing spike-like inflorescences. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are clustered in dense spikes, and it produces small, three-angled berries. Kyllinga caespitosa is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in moist conditions."
