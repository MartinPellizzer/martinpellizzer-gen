    "intro": "Kokoona littoralis var. longifolia, commonly known as the coastal kokoona, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to coastal environments. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white or pale blue flowers, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline, often in areas with high salinity and wind exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
