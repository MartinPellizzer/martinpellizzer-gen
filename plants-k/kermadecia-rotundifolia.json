    "intro": "Kermadecia rotundifolia, commonly known as the New Zealand rock fern, is a perennial herb native to the Kermadec Islands and parts of New Zealand. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and possesses a rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in rocky and coastal environments. The plant has trifoliate leaves that are rounded and glossy, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, and it is pollinated by wind rather than insects. Kermadecia rotundifolia is well adapted to harsh maritime conditions and is often found growing on limestone and basalt substrates."
