    "intro": "Kyllinga pumila, commonly known as dwarf spikerush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, preferring shallow water or saturated soil. The plant has slender, grass-like stems with small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny white or pale pink flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Kyllinga pumila plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
