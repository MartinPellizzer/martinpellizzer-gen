    "intro": "Kaurorchis, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers, which are often fragrant and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Kaurorchis species typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks in humid tropical environments. These plants require specific conditions to thrive, including high humidity, indirect light, and well-draining soil."
