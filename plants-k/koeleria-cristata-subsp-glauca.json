    "intro": "Koeleria cristata subsp. glauca, commonly known as the blue grass or glaucous tufted grass, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing perennial grass with slender, tufted culms and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant's leaves are typically blue-green in color, giving it its common name, and it produces small, white or pale blue flowers. It thrives in cold, dry environments and is often found in alpine and tundra habitats. This subspecies is adapted to harsh climatic conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems."
