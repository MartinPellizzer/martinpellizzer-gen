    "intro": "Koeleria panicea, commonly known as the panicled koeleria, is a flowering plant native to the cold climates of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. Koeleria panicea is often found in alpine and arctic regions, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
