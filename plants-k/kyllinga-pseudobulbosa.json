    "intro": "Kyllinga pseudobulbosa, commonly known as the purple bulbous sedge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features grass-like leaves that are often glaucous and have a distinctive purple hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny white or pale green flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in wetland environments. Kyllinga pseudobulbosa is often found in marshes, along stream banks, and in other moist habitats."
