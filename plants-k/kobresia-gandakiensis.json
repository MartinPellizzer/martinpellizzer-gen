    "intro": "Kobresia gandakiensis, commonly known as the Nepal hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat. Kobresia gandakiensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
