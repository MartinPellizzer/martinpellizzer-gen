    "intro": "Koeleria transiliensis, commonly known as the Transilian grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
