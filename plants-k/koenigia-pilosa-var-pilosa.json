    "intro": "Koenigia pilosa var. pilosa, commonly known as the woolly stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Africa. It features dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its compact size and ornamental appearance make it suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
