    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis subvar. superfusa, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically forms dense mats of fine, grass-like foliage with narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous slender, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is occasionally cultivated in native plant gardens."
