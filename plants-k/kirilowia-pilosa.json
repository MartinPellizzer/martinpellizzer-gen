    "intro": "Kirilowia pilosa, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It has a compact, mat-like growth habit with small, fleshy, often hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Kirilowia pilosa is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
