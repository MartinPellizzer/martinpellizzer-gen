    "intro": "Koeleria phleoides var. condensata, commonly known as the denseleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, tufted foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid landscapes."
