    "intro": "Kalanchoe lateritia var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate kalanchoe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with fleshy, thick leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its compact growth makes it suitable for rock gardens, containers, and as a ground cover."
