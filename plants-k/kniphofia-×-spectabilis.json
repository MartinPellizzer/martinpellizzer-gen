It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from red to orange, yellow, and even white, depending on the cultivar. The plant features sword-shaped, grass-like leaves that are typically green and arranged in a rosette at the base. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early autumn."
