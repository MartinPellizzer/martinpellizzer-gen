    "intro": "Kalanchoe lanceolata var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular kalanchoe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, glandular hairs, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during the winter months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves. This species is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and long-lasting blooms."
