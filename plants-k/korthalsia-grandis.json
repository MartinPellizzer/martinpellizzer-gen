    "intro": "Korthalsia grandis, commonly known as the giant korthalsia, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, leathery, elliptical leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces showy, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its woody structure and dense foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Korthalsia grandis is also valued for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and its tolerance to partial shade."
