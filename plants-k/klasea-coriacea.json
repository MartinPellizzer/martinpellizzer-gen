    "intro": "Klasea coriacea, commonly known as the rough klasea, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Klasea coriacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
