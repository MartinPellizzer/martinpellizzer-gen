    "intro": "Kyllinga debilis, commonly known as the slender spikerush, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant features slender, upright stems with small, grass-like leaves, and it produces spikes of tiny, white or pale pink flowers. Kyllinga debilis is often found in shallow water or moist soil, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems. Its presence is an indicator of healthy, undisturbed wetland habitats."
