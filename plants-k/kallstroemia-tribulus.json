    "intro": "Kallstroemia tribulus, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, bright red flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. Kallstroemia tribulus is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
