    "intro": "Kochia scoparia var. subglabra, commonly known as tumbleweed, is a flowering plant native to Eurasia and North America. It is characterized by its bristly, triangular leaves and showy, spherical flower heads that appear in late summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments, often growing in disturbed soils. Its seeds are dispersed when the plant dries and breaks apart, contributing to its invasive spread in some regions. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil."
