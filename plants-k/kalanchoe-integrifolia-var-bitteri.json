    "intro": "Kalanchoe integrifolia var. bitteri, commonly known as the Bitter Kalanchoe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, upright stems covered in dense, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water, and the species is known for its resilience to drought. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and ease of care."
