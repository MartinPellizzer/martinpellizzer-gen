    "intro": "Kyllinga brevifolia subsp. lurida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spikerush, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate spikes, a characteristic common in sedges. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
