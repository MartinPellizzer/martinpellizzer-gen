    "intro": "Kaempferia rubromarginata, commonly known as the red-margin orchid, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, brightly colored flowers. The plant features broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, tropical habitat. Its flowers typically have a distinctive red or pink margin on the petals, giving it its common name. Kaempferia rubromarginata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
