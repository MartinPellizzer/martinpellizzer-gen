    "intro": "Kentrophyllum lanatum var. baeticum, commonly known as the Baetican velvetleaf, is a rare and endemic species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions with limestone soils. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection."
