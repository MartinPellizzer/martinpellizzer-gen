    "intro": "Koeleria clarkeana, commonly known as the Clarke's feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like clumps with fine, silver-blue foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Koeleria clarkeana is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
