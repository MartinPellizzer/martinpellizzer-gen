    "intro": "Kita laevis, commonly known as the smoothleaf plant, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and hairless on both surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their mild sedative properties. Kita laevis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in its natural habitat."
