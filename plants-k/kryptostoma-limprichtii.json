    "intro": "Kryptostoma limprichtii, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact rosette of velvety, waxy leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, often with a contrasting throat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Kryptostoma limprichtii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
