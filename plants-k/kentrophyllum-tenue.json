    "intro": "Kentrophyllum tenue, commonly known as the slender kidney fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near streams or in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots that help anchor it to rocky or moist soil. Kentrophyllum tenue is valued for its ornamental foliage and is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
