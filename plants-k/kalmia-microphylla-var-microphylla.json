    "intro": "Kalmia microphylla var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf mountain laurel, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, leathery foliage with dark green, elliptical leaves that remain largely unchanged throughout the year. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer, typically in shades of white or pink. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its slow growth rate and ornamental value make it a popular choice for erosion control and landscape design."
