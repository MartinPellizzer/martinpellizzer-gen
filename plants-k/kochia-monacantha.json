    "intro": "Kochia monacantha, commonly known as the searocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and succulent leaves. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shores and cliffs. Its growth is typically low and spreading, forming dense mats that help stabilize coastal dunes. Kochia monacantha is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
