    "intro": "Kotschya ochreata var. longipetala, commonly known as the long-petioled ochre lily, is a striking tropical plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters at the ends of its long, slender stems. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a sought-after plant for both horticultural collections and botanical gardens."
