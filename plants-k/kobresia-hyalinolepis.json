    "intro": "Kobresia hyalinolepis, commonly known as the glassy kobresia, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its resilience and adaptability, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh mountainous regions."
