    "intro": "Kayea larnachiana, commonly known as the Larnaca cypress, is a rare and endemic species native to Cyprus. It is a coniferous tree belonging to the family Cupressaceae, characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit. The plant features scale-like leaves arranged in opposite pairs along the stems, and it produces small, woody cones. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
