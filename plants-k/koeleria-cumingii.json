    "intro": "Koeleria cumingii, commonly known as the Cuming's feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, feathery seed heads that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental seed heads make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Koeleria cumingii is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
