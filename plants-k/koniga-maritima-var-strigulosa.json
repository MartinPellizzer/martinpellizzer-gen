    "intro": "Koniga maritima var. strigulosa, commonly known as the coastal rockrose, is a perennial shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense foliage and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to saline and wind-exposed environments. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh coastal conditions."
