    "intro": "Kobresia glaucifolia, commonly known as the glaucous kobresia, is a low-growing perennial grass found in high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and often thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its small, spike-like inflorescences contain numerous tiny flowers, which are pollinated by wind. Kobresia glaucifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
