    "intro": "Kniphofia crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved torch lily, is a striking perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that bear bright red or orange tubular flowers, which are clustered in dense, torch-like inflorescences. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the base, giving it a unique and dramatic appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Kniphofia crassifolia is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as birds and insects."
