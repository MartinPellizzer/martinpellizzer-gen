    "intro": "Katapsuxis cicutefolia, commonly known as the creeping sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Katapsuxis cicutefolia is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh, drought-prone habitats."
