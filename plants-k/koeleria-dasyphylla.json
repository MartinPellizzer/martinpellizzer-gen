    "intro": "Koeleria dasyphylla, commonly known as the roughleaf wildrye, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, compact foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Koeleria dasyphylla is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to survive in arid environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
