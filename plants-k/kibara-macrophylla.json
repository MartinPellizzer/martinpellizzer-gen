    "intro": "Kibara macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter, which float on the surface of still or slow-moving waters. The plant's showy white flowers bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies. Kibara macrophylla plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms."
