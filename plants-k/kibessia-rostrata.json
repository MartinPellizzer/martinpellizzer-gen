    "intro": "Kibessia rostrata, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, red berries. Kibessia rostrata is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is used in traditional crafts and as a source of timber. However, due to overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species in many regions."
