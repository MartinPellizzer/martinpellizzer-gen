    "intro": "Kreysigia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to drought conditions. Its leaves are usually small and hairy, which helps reduce water loss. Kreysigia is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens."
