    "intro": "Koeleria tokiensis, commonly known as Toki's grass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically green or pale blue in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Koeleria tokiensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
