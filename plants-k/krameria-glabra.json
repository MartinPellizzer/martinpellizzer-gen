    "intro": "Krameria glabra, commonly known as the nakedstick, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Capparaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds. Krameria glabra is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities in dryland gardens."
