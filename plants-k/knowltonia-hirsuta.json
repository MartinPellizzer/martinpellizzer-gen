The plant features broad, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture, giving it its common name. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Knowltonia hirsuta is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
