    "intro": "Koeleria glauca subsp. albescens, commonly known as the whitekoeleria, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-gray leaves that are covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, pale blue to white flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
