It features slender, erect stems with lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into three-lobed, red or purple seed capsules. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Its ornamental value comes from its compact growth habit and striking seed heads."
