    "intro": "Kibessia acuminatissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved kibessia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, and it is often found growing in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a component of the understory vegetation in these ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and ecological balance."
