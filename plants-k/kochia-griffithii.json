    "intro": "Kochia griffithii, commonly known as the Indian kochia, is an annual plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking, feather-like leaves that turn red or purple in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, bract-based inflorescences. Kochia griffithii is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
