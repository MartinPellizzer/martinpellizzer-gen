    "intro": "Karpatiosorbus tobani, commonly known as the Carpathian hawthorn, is a shrub native to the Carpathian Mountains in Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
