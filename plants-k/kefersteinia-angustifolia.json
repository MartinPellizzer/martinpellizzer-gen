    "intro": "Kefersteinia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf kefersteinia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features slender, upright stems that bear narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
