It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as plains, slopes, and disturbed areas. Koeleria rohlfsii is adapted to arid conditions and is often found in regions with low precipitation and well-drained soils."
