    "intro": "Kolobopetalum suberosum, commonly known as the rough-leaved sandmat, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, rough-textured leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne in dense inflorescences. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. Kolobopetalum suberosum is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its resilience in harsh environments."
