    "intro": "Kickxia spuria, commonly known as the common rockcress, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous areas. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in late spring. Its flowers are clustered in elongated racemes, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor environments. Kickxia spuria is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
