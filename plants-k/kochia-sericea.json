It is an annual herb that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, characterized by its prostrate or erect growth habit. The plant features small, green, diamond-shaped leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers in the summer. Its seeds are covered in a white, powdery coating, which aids in wind dispersal. Kochia sericea is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid environments."
