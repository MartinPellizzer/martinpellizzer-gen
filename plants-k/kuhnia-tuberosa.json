It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green or brown, and it is known for its tuberous roots that store nutrients. Kuhnia tuberosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of wetland ecosystems."
