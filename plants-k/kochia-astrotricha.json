    "intro": "Kochia astrotricha, commonly known as the starburst kochia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its vibrant, star-shaped bracts that give it a distinctive appearance, especially during the fall when they turn shades of red, orange, and purple. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Kochia astrotricha is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. It is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its striking visual appeal and low maintenance requirements."
