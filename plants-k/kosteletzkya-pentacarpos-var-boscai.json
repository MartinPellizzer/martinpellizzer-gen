    "intro": "Kosteletzkya pentacarpos var. boscai, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots help it survive in dry conditions, and it is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The species is adapted to hot, dry climates and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
