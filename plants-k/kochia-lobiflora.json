    "intro": "Kochia lobiflora, commonly known as the broadleaf kochia, is an annual plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking, feather-like bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. Kochia lobiflora is adapted to arid environments and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in fields. It has been used in some regions for erosion control due to its rapid growth and hardiness."
