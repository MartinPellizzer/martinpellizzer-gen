    "intro": "Karpatiosorbus badensis, commonly known as the Carpathian barbed sorbus, is a shrub native to the Carpathian Mountains. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spiny branches and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in early summer, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for certain bird species. It thrives in rocky or woodland soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
