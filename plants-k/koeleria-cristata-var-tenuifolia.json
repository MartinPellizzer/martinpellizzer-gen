    "intro": "Koeleria cristata var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It features a dense, mat-forming growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
