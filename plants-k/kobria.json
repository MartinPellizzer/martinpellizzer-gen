    "intro": "Kobria, commonly known as the rock rose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. It consists of several species, many of which are native to regions of Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. The plants are typically low-growing shrubs with showy, often pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Their foliage is usually evergreen, with small, leathery leaves that are adapted to dry, rocky environments. Kobria species are valued in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
