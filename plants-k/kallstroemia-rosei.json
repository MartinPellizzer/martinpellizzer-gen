    "intro": "Kallstroemia rosei, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pink to lavender-colored flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Kallstroemia rosei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens to attract pollinators."
