    "intro": "Kellochloa verrucosa, commonly known as the woolly moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a green, leafy appearance and is covered in a fine layer of pubescence, giving it a woolly texture. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often used as an indicator species for undisturbed ecosystems. Kellochloa verrucosa plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
