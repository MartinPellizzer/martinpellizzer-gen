    "intro": "Koeleria probatovae, commonly known as the Siberian grass or Siberian wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme temperatures. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Koeleria probatovae is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens with a preference for cool climates."
