    "intro": "Krainzia crinita subsp. leucantha, commonly known as the white-flowered krainzia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Krainzia crinita subsp. leucantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
