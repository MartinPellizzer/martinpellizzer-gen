    "intro": "Kaukenia fructicosa, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red, often blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. Kaukenia fructicosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh coastal conditions."
