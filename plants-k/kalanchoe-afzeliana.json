    "intro": "Kalanchoe afzeliana, commonly known as the African violet, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with red or purple margins. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Kalanchoe afzeliana is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
