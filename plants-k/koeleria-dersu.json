    "intro": "Koeleria dersu, commonly known as the Dersu grass, is a flowering plant native to the cold climates of Central Asia and Siberia. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Koeleria dersu is well adapted to arctic and alpine conditions, thriving in poor soils and extreme temperature fluctuations."
