    "intro": "Kuhnistera candida var. multiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered kuhnistera, is a rare and delicate plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, pale white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the cooler months. The plant has slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
