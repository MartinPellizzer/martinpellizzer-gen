    "intro": "Koeleria salzmannii var. valdepilosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf goatgrass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, silky foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and a compact, mat-forming structure that allows it to thrive in arid and rocky environments. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, slopes, and disturbed areas."
