    "intro": "Kethosia, commonly known as the flame violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its showy, violet-colored flowers. The plants typically have hairy stems and leaves, which help them retain moisture in their arid habitat. Kethosia species are often found in rocky soils and thrive in full sun. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens."
