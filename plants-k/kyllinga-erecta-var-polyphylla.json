Its flowering period occurs in the summer months, producing tiny, three-lobed flowers that are clustered in dense spikes. Kyllinga erecta var. polyphylla is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
