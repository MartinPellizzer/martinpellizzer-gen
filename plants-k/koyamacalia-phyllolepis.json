    "intro": "Koyamacalia phyllolepis, commonly known as the leafy koyama, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
