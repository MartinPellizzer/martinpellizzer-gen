    "intro": "Koeleria cristata var. nemoralis, commonly known as the sheep's beard, is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in rocky and sandy soils. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with purple. The plant is native to regions of Europe and western Asia, where it often grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its small, grass-like leaves are typically blue-green in color, and it is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Koeleria cristata var. nemoralis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid or disturbed landscapes."
