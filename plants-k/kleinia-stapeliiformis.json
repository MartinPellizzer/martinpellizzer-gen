    "intro": "Kleinia stapeliiformis, commonly known as the Cape Hottentot, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
