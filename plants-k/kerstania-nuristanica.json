    "intro": "Kerstania nuristanica, commonly known as the Nuristan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of northern Afghanistan and Pakistan. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, silvery hair, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Kerstania nuristanica is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
