    "intro": "Koeleria triaristata, commonly known as the three-awn grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear three awns on each lemma. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Koeleria triaristata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
