    "intro": "Krameria ovata, commonly known as the yellow-flowered burr plant, is a flowering plant native to the deserts of North America. It is characterized by its spiny, woody fruits that encase the seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by animals. The plant produces yellow, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in arid environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Krameria ovata is a member of the family Capparaceae and is known for its drought-resistant properties."
