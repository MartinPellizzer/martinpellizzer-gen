    "intro": "Kleinia descoingsii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a succulent shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often blooming during the rainy season. Its fleshy leaves are thick and waxy, helping to store water and reduce transpiration. Kleinia descoingsii is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in drought-prone areas."
