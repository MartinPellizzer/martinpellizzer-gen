    "intro": "Koeleria villosa subsp. longiglumis, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine zones. The plant features slender, tufted stems with hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, whitish pubescence. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lipped flowers. This subspecies is characterized by its distinctive glumes and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
