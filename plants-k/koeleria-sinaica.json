    "intro": "Koeleria sinaica, commonly known as the Sinai grass, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East, particularly the Sinai Peninsula. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom during the cooler months. Koeleria sinaica is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its presence is often indicative of rocky or sandy habitats in semi-arid climates."
