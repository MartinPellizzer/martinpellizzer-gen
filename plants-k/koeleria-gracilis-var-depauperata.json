    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis var. depauperata, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often found in disturbed or dry habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies and potential use in restoration projects."
