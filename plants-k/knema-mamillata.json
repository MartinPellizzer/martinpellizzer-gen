    "intro": "Knema mamillata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf knema, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and elliptical leaves with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries. Its roots and leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though it is primarily valued for its ecological role in forest ecosystems. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and plays a significant part in maintaining biodiversity in its native habitat."
