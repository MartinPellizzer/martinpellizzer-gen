    "intro": "Koeleria hosseana var. tafelii, commonly known as the Tafel's sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its botanical features make it well-suited for ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
