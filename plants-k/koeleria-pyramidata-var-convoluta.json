It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and distinctive, rolled or curled leaf blades. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, greenish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
