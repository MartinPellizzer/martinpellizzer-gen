    "intro": "Kniphofia uvaria, commonly known as the red hot poker, is a striking perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear dense clusters of tubular red or orange flowers, which resemble poker chips, giving it its common name. The plant has lance-shaped, grass-like leaves that are dark green and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Kniphofia uvaria is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as birds and insects."
