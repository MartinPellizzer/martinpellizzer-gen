    "intro": "Kohautia caespitosa var. amaniensis, commonly known as the Amani sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the mountainous regions of East Africa. It forms dense, clump-like growths with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in montane forest or grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
