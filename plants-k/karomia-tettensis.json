    "intro": "Karomia tettensis, commonly known as the African star grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in spikes. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its fibrous roots are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
