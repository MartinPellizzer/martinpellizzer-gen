    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis var. pratensis, commonly known as slender oatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and slender, erect flowering stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used for erosion control."
