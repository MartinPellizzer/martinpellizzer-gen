It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and showy inflorescences. The plant produces dense clusters of bright red or orange tubular flowers surrounded by a white, bulbous bract that resembles a head, giving it its common name. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Kniphofia leucocephala is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
