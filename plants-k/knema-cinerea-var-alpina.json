    "intro": "Knema cinerea var. alpina, commonly known as the Alpine knema, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Myrtaceae family. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually pale yellow or white, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
