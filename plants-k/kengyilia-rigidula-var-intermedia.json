    "intro": "Kengyilia rigidula var. intermedia, commonly known as the Tibetan blue poppy, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and robust, woody stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, dry conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its beautiful blooms."
