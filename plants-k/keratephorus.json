    "intro": "Keratephorus, commonly known as the yellow-eyed grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. Keratephorus species are perennial and have rhizomatous growth, allowing them to spread and form dense colonies. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
