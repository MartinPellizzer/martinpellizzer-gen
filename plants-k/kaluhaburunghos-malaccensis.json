It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny fruit capsules. Its seeds are encased in a hard, burred husk, which gives the plant its common name. Kaluhaburunghos malaccensis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
