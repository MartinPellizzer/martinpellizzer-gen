    "intro": "Knowlesia, commonly known as the orchid vine, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. They are characterized by their climbing habit, with long, trailing stems that often root at the nodes. Knowlesia species produce showy, fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated as houseplants or in greenhouse environments."
