    "intro": "Kobresia capilliformis, commonly known as the hair grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine and arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fine, hair-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically thrives in cold, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Kobresia capilliformis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in harsh climates. Its ability to survive in extreme conditions makes it a valuable indicator species for high-altitude ecosystems."
