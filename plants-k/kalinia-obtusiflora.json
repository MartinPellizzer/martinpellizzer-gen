    "intro": "Kalinia obtusiflora, commonly known as the blunt-flowered kalinia, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, with hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowering period occurs during the spring and early summer, and it is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora. Kalinia obtusiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
