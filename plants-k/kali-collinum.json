    "intro": "Kali collinum, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique species of flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its striking, pale purple to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a creeping growth habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous fruits that contain the seeds. Kali collinum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a subject of interest in botanical studies due to its distinctive appearance and limited distribution."
