    "intro": "Koeleria grandis var. gacilescens, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, tufted stems that grow up to 30 cm in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
