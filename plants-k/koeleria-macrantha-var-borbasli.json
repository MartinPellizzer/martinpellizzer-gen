    "intro": "Koeleria macrantha var. borbasli, commonly known as Borbas' sedge, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and aesthetic value. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
