    "intro": "Keteleeria dopiana, commonly known as the Chinese fir, is a species of coniferous tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Keteleeria dopiana plays an important role in forest ecosystems and is valued for its timber."
