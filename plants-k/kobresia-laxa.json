    "intro": "Kobresia laxa, commonly known as the loose kobresia, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent areas. It forms dense, mat-like growths that help stabilize soil in harsh, arid environments. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. It is adapted to cold climates and can thrive at elevations above 4,000 meters. Kobresia laxa plays an important ecological role in preventing soil erosion and providing habitat for various alpine species."
