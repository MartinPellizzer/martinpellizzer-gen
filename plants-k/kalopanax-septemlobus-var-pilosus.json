    "intro": "Kalopanax septemlobus var. pilosus, commonly known as the hairy seven-lobed cow-itch plant, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its palmate leaves with seven lobes, which are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by spiny, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
