    "intro": "Kanimia palustris, commonly known as the swamp kanimia, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, exhibiting adaptations such as a fibrous root system for anchoring in soft substrates. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Kanimia palustris plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
