    "intro": "Koeleria inaequalis, commonly known as the unequal bottlebrush grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive, bottlebrush-like inflorescence that consists of tightly packed spikelets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Koeleria inaequalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often used in native plant landscaping."
