    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis var. sabulosa, commonly known as sand grass or slender wild oat, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions. It has fine, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, pale blue or greenish flowers in early summer, which are arranged in dense spikes. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or disturbed areas. Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
