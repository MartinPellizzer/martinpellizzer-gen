    "intro": "Kernera spinulosa, commonly known as the spiny kernera, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is found in regions such as New South Wales and South Australia. The plant features slender, spiny stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Kernera spinulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
