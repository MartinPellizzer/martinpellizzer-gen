    "intro": "Koeleria \u00d7 rigidula, commonly known as the rigid false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought tolerance. Koeleria \u00d7 rigidula is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
