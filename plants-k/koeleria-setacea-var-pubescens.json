    "intro": "Koeleria setacea var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy tufted grass, is a perennial flowering plant native to the cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
