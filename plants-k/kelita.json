    "intro": "Kelita, commonly known as *Cissus discolor*, is a tropical vine native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Kelita thrives in warm, humid environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in shaded areas."
