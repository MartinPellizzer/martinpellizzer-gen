    "intro": "Kleberiella, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical Africa. These plants are characterized by their rosettes of velvety, waxy leaves and their showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. Kleberiella species typically thrive in well-draining soil and require bright, indirect light to flourish. They are popular houseplants due to their compact size and ability to bloom throughout the year. The genus includes several species, with Streptocarpus being one of the most widely cultivated."
