It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are leathery and arranged in whorls, adapting to the harsh, cold climate of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
