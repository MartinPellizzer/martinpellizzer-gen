    "intro": "Kobresia simpliciuscula subsp. subfilifolia, commonly known as the Filifoliate Kobresia, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in clusters, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. It is adapted to cold and arid environments, often found in alpine and subalpine regions. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
