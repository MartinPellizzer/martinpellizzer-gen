It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped. Its showy pink to purple flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Knautia biformis prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
