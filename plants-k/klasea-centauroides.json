    "intro": "Klasea centauroides, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the summer months. Its root system is extensive and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Klasea centauroides is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
