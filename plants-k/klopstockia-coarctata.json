    "intro": "Klopstockia coarctata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved klopstockia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white or pale green. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
