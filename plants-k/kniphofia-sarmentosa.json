    "intro": "Kniphofia sarmentosa, commonly known as the red hot poker, is a striking perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that bear clusters of bright red, tubular flowers resembling poker chips. The plant produces showy, fiery orange to red inflorescences that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette. Kniphofia sarmentosa is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
