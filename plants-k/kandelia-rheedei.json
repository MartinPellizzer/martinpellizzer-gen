    "intro": "Kandelia rheedei, commonly known as the mangrove apple, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhizophoraceae. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments, and is commonly found in coastal areas and estuaries. The plant has prop roots that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in tidal zones. Its small, white flowers are followed by orange or red fruits that contain several seeds. Kandelia rheedei plays a vital role in the ecological balance of mangrove ecosystems."
