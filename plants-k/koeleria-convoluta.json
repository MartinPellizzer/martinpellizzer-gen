    "intro": "Koeleria convoluta, commonly known as the twisted wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in alpine and arctic environments, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant has slender, wiry stems that often curl or twist, giving it its common name. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are usually covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. Koeleria convoluta is known for its resilience to harsh conditions, making it an important component of high-altitude and tundra ecosystems."
