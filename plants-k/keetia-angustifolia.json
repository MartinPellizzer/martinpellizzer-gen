It is a shrub that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, clustered in small inflorescences, and bloom during the warmer months.
