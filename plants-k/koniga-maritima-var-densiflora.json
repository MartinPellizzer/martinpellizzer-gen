    "intro": "Koniga maritima var. densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered sea holly, is a coastal plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silver-green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its dense flower clusters make it a notable ornamental plant in coastal gardens."
