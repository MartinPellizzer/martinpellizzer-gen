    "intro": "Karatas karatas, commonly known as the desert rose, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for dry climates. The flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few days, but they attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
