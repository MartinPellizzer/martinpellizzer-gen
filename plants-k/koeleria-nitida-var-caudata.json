    "intro": "Koeleria nitida var. caudata, commonly known as the silky grass vetch, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of North America. It features fine, silky hairs covering its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
