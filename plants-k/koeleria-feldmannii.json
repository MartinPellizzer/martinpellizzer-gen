    "intro": "Koeleria feldmannii, commonly known as Feldmann's needlegrass, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in dry, rocky soils. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale blue or purple flowers. Feldmann's needlegrass is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive drought conditions. It is often found in desert scrub and sagebrush habitats."
