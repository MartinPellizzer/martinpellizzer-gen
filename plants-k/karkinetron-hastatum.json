    "intro": "Karkinetron hastatum, commonly known as the jagged-leaf fern, is a unique plant native to the humid rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its serrated, lance-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of its leaves. Karkinetron hastatum is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
