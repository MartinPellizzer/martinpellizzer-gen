    "intro": "Kobresia nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal sedge, is a perennial grass species native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and India. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a mat-like structure. This plant thrives in high-altitude meadows and alpine environments, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in mountainous areas. Kobresia nepalensis plays a vital ecological role in maintaining the integrity of alpine ecosystems and supporting local biodiversity."
