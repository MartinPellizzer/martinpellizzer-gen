    "intro": "Kumlienia hystricula, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which are followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. Kumlienia hystricula plays an important role in desert ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
