    "intro": "Kefersteinia stevensonii, commonly known as the Stevenson's kefersteinia, is a rare and unique member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and produces striking, colorful inflorescences that can range from red to orange. Native to the cloud forests of Mexico, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically thick and fleshy, adapted to store moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
