    "intro": "Koeleria nitida subvar. transiens, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features fine, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often mistaken for cotton. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its botanical characteristics include narrow, grass-like leaves and a mat-forming growth habit. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
