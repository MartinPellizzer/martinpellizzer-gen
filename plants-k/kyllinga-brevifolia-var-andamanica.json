    "intro": "Kyllinga brevifolia var. andamanica, commonly known as the Andaman arrowhead, is a herbaceous plant native to the Andaman Islands. It features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in moist, shaded environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
