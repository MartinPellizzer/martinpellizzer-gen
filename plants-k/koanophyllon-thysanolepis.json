    "intro": "Koanophyllon thysanolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cottonwood, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a silvery or grayish coating, which helps reduce water loss. Koanophyllon thysanolepis plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert wildlife."
