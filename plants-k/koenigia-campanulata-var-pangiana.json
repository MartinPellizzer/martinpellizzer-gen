    "intro": "Koenigia campanulata var. pangiana, commonly known as the Mountain Bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often with a distinctive yellow throat. The plant has basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptability to extreme conditions and its role in alpine ecosystems."
