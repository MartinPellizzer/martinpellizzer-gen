    "intro": "Krigia cespitosa, commonly known as yellowflower ragwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features basal rosettes of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairies and disturbed areas. It has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in harsh environmental conditions. Krigia cespitosa is an important plant for pollinators and is often used in native plant gardens."
