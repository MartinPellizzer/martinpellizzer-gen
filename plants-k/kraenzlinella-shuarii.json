    "intro": "Kraenzlinella shuarii, commonly known as the Shuarii kraenzlinella, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid climates. Its leaves are generally elliptical with a glossy surface, and it produces pale yellow to white blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Kraenzlinella shuarii is considered a species of conservation concern."
