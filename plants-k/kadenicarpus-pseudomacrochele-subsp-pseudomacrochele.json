    "intro": "Kadenicarpus pseudomacrochele subsp. pseudomacrochele, commonly known as the broad-leaved kadenicarpus, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Kadenicarpaceae. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with distinct sepals and petals, typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky, coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
