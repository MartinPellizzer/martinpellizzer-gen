    "intro": "Kaempferia minor, commonly known as the dwarf flame orchid, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces striking, fiery orange and red flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are strap-shaped and often have a waxy texture, typical of many orchids. Kaempferia minor is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation in warm, humid environments."
