It is characterized by its smooth, glossy bark and elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are rich in vitamin C and other nutrients. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and lowland forests. Kayea meridionalis is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its medicinal and nutritional properties."
