    "intro": "Kobresia sargentiana, commonly known as the Sargent's feathergrass, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent areas of China. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Kobresia sargentiana is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
