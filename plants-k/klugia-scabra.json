    "intro": "Klugia scabra, commonly known as the rough klugia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Klugia scabra thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions and it is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems."
