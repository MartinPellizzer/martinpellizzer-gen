    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis var. gypsacea, commonly known as the Gypsaceus Koeleria, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and native plant gardens."
