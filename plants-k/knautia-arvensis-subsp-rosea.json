    "intro": "Knautia arvensis subsp. rosea, commonly known as the pink field knautia, is a perennial herb native to central and eastern Europe. It features upright stems covered in soft, hairy foliage and produces clusters of showy, rose-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and is often found in meadows and grasslands. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators. The subspecies rosea is distinguished by its more intense pink flower color compared to the typical white or pale pink of the main species."
