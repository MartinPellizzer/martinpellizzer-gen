It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its striking red petals and compact, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its unique coloration and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
