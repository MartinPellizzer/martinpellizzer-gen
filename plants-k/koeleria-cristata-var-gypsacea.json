    "intro": "Koeleria cristata var. gypsacea, commonly known as the gypsum grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and tufted inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in well-drained soils, particularly those rich in gypsum, and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its small, spike-like flowers are typically blue to purple in color, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
