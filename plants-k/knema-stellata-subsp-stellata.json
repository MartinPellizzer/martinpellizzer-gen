    "intro": "Knema stellata subsp. stellata, commonly known as the star-knema, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, glossy dark green leaves that are often arranged in whorls of three to five at the nodes. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by round, fleshy berries containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forest understories. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
