    "intro": "Kedrostis rigidiuscula, commonly known as the rigid dwarf spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many species with latex-producing properties. The plant is characterized by its small, erect stature and distinctive yellow cyathia, which are specialized floral structures. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or dry habitats. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
