    "intro": "Koeleria hispida, commonly known as the hairy needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and wiry, hairy stems that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought. Koeleria hispida is often found in grasslands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
