    "intro": "Koelreuteria procumbens, commonly known as the Chinese lantern tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive orange-red\u84b4\u679c that resemble lanterns. These fruits are often used in traditional Chinese medicine and as ornamental elements in gardens. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
