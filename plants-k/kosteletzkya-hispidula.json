It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features showy, pale pink to lavender flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered with fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. Kosteletzkya hispidula is adapted to fluctuating water levels and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
