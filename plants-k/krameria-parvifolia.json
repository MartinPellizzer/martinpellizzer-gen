    "intro": "Krameria parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved krameria, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and desert environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in fine hairs. Krameria parvifolia is adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in low-water environments. It is also known for its medicinal properties, as it has been used by indigenous peoples for various traditional remedies."
