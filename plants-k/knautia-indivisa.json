It belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in meadows, woodlands, and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a hairy texture, and it produces small, oval fruits called schizocarps.
