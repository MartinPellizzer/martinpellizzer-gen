It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that persist into winter. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness. Karpatiosorbus hybrida thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight."
