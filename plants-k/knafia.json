    "intro": "Knafia, commonly known as a type of traditional Middle Eastern pastry, is a layered dough product made from semolina, butter, and sugar. It is typically baked in a conical or cylindrical shape, resulting in a crisp, flaky texture. The botanical aspect of knafia lies in its use of wheat semolina as the primary ingredient, which is derived from the grain Triticum aestivum. The dough's structure is formed through the mechanical working of the ingredients, creating layers that contribute to its unique texture. While not a plant in the botanical sense, the plant-based ingredients like wheat and sugar play a crucial role in its composition."
