    "intro": "Kobresia lepidochlamys, commonly known as the Tibetan feather grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and dense, mat-forming growth habit, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. This plant thrives in cold, arid climates with well-drained soils, often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive colonies. Kobresia lepidochlamys plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine species."
