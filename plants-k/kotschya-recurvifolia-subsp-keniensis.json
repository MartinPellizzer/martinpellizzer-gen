    "intro": "Kotschya recurvifolia subsp. keniensis, commonly known as the Kenyan arrowleaf, is a rare and unique plant native to East Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves, which are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and rocky outcrops. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with a reddish or purple hue. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
