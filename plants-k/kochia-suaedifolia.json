    "intro": "Kochia suaedifolia, commonly known as burning bush, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy bracts that range from red to orange, giving it its common name. The plant is an annual or biennial species, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its leaves are small, narrow, and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Kochia suaedifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens and landscapes for its striking fall color."
