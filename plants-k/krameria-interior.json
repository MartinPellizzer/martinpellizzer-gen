    "intro": "Krameria interior, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Krameria interior is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
