    "intro": "Kedrostis gilgiana, commonly known as the African spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange sap, which is toxic to humans and animals. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along riverbanks. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by livestock and wildlife."
