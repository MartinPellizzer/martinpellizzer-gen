    "intro": "Koeleria drucei, commonly known as the narrowleaf wintergrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Koeleria drucei is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
