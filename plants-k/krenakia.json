    "intro": "Krenakia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pale pink or white flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant has a short life cycle, often completing its growth and reproduction within a few weeks. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, silky hair, which helps it retain moisture in its harsh environment. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Krenakia is considered a rare and protected species in its native habitat."
