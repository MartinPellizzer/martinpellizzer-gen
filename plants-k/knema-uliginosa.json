    "intro": "Knema uliginosa, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. Its flowers are fragrant and borne in clusters, attracting various pollinators. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its propagation in wetland habitats."
