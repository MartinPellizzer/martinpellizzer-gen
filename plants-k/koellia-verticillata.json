    "intro": "Koellia verticillata, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Koellia verticillata is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained conditions."
