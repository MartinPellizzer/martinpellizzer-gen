    "intro": "Kengyilia batalinii var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf kengyilia, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, hairy leaves that are typically clustered at the base, and its flowers are showy, with bright yellow petals that contrast with the green foliage. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and considered a delicately sensitive species."
