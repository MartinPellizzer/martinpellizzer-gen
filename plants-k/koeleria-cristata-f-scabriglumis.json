    "intro": "Koeleria cristata f. scabriglumis, commonly known as the scabrous fringed grass, is a hemicryptophytic plant native to the northern regions of the United States and Canada. It is characterized by its distinctive, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of silky hairs. The inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in early summer. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes, and it is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
