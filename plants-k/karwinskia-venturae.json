    "intro": "Karwinskia venturae, commonly known as the Ventura's karwinskia, is a rare shrub native to the coastal regions of Southern California. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Karwinskia venturae is considered a threatened species."
