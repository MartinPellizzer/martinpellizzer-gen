    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis var. mexicana, commonly known as Mexican slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Mexico. It features fine, needle-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. The plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and can tolerate drought conditions due to its deep root system. It is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies in xerophytic environments."
