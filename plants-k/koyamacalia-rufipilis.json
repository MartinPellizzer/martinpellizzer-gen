    "intro": "Koyamacalia rufipilis, commonly known as the red-haired koyama, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant features slender, hairy stems and compound leaves with a distinctive reddish hue, especially on the underside. Its flowers are small and white, forming dense clusters that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Koyamacalia rufipilis is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
