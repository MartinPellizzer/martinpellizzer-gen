    "intro": "Koanophyllon pittieri, commonly known as the Mexican feathergrass, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and delicate, feathery inflorescences. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open grasslands. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are usually green or pale blue, and it produces lightweight seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind. Koanophyllon pittieri is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
