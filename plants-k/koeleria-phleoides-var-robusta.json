    "intro": "Koeleria phleoides var. robusta, commonly known as the robust koeleria, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains in South America. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically produces delicate blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
