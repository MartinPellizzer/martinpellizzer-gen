    "intro": "Karimbolea, commonly known as the moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its large, white, nocturnal blooms that open at night and close by morning. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. Its flowers emit a sweet fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Karimbolea is a member of the nightshade family and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
