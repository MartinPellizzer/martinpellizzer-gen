    "intro": "Kobresia cuneata, commonly known as the tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to the alpine and arctic regions of Eurasia. It forms dense, cushion-like tussocks that help stabilize soil in harsh environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions. Kobresia cuneata plays an important ecological role in preventing erosion and supporting local biodiversity."
