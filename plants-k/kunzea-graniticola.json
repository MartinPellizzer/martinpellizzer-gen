    "intro": "Kunzea graniticola, commonly known as the granite kunzea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils, often found on granite outcrops. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
