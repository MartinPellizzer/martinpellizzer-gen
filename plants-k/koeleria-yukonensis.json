    "intro": "Koeleria yukonensis, commonly known as Yukon grass, is a perennial grass native to the Yukon and Alaska. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, dry habitats such as tundra and alpine meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a blue-gray sheen that helps reduce water loss. Koeleria yukonensis is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor soil conditions."
