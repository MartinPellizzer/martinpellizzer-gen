    "intro": "Kuramosciadium corydalifolium, commonly known as the silverleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a silvery down on the underside, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged seeds dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it typically grows to a height of 20 to 40 meters. Kuramosciadium corydalifolium thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
