    "intro": "Kochia scoparia f. littorea, commonly known as sea kochia, is a salt-tolerant, annual plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant has a bushy growth habit with triangular, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in late summer, and it produces fluffy, seed-filled capsules that disperse easily. This hardy species is valued for its ability to stabilize coastal soils and its ornamental appeal in arid landscapes."
