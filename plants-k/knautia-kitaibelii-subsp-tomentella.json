    "intro": "Knautia kitaibelii subsp. tomentella, commonly known as the woolly knautia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fuzzy, silver-gray foliage and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The subspecies tomentella is distinguished by its dense, woolly hair covering the stems and leaves, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. This plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
