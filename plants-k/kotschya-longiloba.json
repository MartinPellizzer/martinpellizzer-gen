    "intro": "Kotschya longiloba, commonly known as the long-stemmed kotschya, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with thick leaves and a deep root system to conserve water. Kotschya longiloba is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine by local communities."
