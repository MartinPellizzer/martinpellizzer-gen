    "intro": "Koeberlinia spinosa var. wivaggii, commonly known as the Wivaggii spurge, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, densely branched growth habit and produces small, yellow flowers that appear in late summer. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its dry habitat. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. The varietal form wivaggii is distinguished by its unique leaf and flower characteristics compared to the typical species."
