    "intro": "Karawata gustavoi, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Cyatheaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its rhizome system allows it to anchor firmly in the soil, while its fronds can grow up to several meters in length. Karawata gustavoi plays an important role in the ecological structure of its native habitat."
