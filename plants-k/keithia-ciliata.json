    "intro": "Keithia ciliata, commonly known as the fringed keithia, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves with fine, ciliate margins. The plant produces small, white or cream-colored flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It typically grows in coastal environments, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
