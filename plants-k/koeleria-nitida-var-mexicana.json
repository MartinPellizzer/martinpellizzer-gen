    "intro": "Koeleria nitida var. mexicana, commonly known as Mexican hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features fine, silver-gray foliage that forms dense, mat-like growths, often reaching heights of 6 to 12 inches. The plant produces small, pale blue to white flower spikes in late spring to early summer, adding a delicate ornamental touch to landscapes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it a valuable plant in arid and semi-arid environments."
