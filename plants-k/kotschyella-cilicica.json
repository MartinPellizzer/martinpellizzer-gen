    "intro": "Kotschyella cilicica, commonly known as the Cilician kotschyella, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae, characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Kotschyella cilicica thrives in rocky and arid environments, often found in mountainous regions of Turkey and Syria. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically important for conservation efforts in its native range."
