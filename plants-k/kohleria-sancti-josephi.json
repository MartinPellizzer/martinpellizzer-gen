    "intro": "Kohleria sancti-josephi, commonly known as the Joseph's kohleria, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, meaning it thrives in moist, shaded environments on the bark of trees. Its foliage consists of glossy, dark green leaves that are often spotted or streaked with contrasting colors. Kohleria sancti-josephi is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
