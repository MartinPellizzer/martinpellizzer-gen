    "intro": "Kleinia rigida, commonly known as the rigid kleiniya, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features dense, compact growth with fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically green and slightly hairy, adapted to store water in arid environments. Kleinia rigida is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
