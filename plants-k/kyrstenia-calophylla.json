    "intro": "Kyrstenia calophylla, commonly known as the goldenleaf kyrstenia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are thick and leathery, with a glossy surface that gives it its common name. Kyrstenia calophylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
