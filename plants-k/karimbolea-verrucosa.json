    "intro": "Karimbolea verrucosa, commonly known as the warty leaf orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, warty-textured leaves and clusters of fragrant, orchid-like flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Its botanical features include a short, rhizomatous stem and lance-shaped leaves with a velvety surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
