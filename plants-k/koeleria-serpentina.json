    "intro": "Koeleria serpentina, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and has narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Koeleria serpentina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
