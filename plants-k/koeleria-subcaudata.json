    "intro": "Koeleria subcaudata, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Himalayas. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Koeleria subcaudata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
