    "intro": "Koeleria cristata subsp. pseudocristata, commonly known as the tufted bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. Its low maintenance requirements and ability to form dense mats make it an effective erosion control plant."
