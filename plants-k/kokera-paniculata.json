    "intro": "Kokera paniculata, commonly known as the panicle grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and branched inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth texture, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Kokera paniculata plays an important role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
