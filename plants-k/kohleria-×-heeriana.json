    "intro": "Kohleria \u00d7 heeriana, commonly known as the hybrid kohleria, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Kohleria mirabilis and Kohleria pulchra. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in warm, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescences that resemble a brush, featuring clusters of tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its vibrant blooms and compact growth habit. Kohleria \u00d7 heeriana prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
