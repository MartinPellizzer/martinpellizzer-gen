    "intro": "Koeleria argentea var. nepalensis, commonly known as the silvergrass of Nepal, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the Himalayan regions. It features narrow, silver-white leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal, a common trait in grasses. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
