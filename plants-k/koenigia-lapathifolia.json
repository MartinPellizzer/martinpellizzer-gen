    "intro": "Koenigia lapathifolia, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its flowers are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences and are typically pink or purple in color. Koenigia lapathifolia is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude or polar regions where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
