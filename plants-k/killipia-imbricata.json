    "intro": "Killipia imbricata, commonly known as the coastal daisy, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming from late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with salt spray and strong winds. Killipia imbricata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
