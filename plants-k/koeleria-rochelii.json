It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the grass family. It has slender, grass-like leaves and is often found in disturbed or arid environments. Koeleria rochelii is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils and is relatively drought-tolerant."
