It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage consists of glossy, ovate leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. Kohleria schiedeana is popular among horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
