    "intro": "Kobresia bellardii var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant Kobresia, is a flowering plant native to the Tibetan Plateau. It is a member of the Poaceae family, commonly referred to as grasses, and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to the high-altitude, cold, and arid conditions of its habitat. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
