    "intro": "Kohautia sennii, commonly known as the Senni's kohautia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Kohautia sennii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the cool, humid climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
