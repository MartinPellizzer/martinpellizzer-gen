    "intro": "Koeleria lagopoides, commonly known as the snowgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats or cushions, which help stabilize soil in harsh environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers. Koeleria lagopoides is adapted to cold climates and can survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various arctic and alpine wildlife species."
