    "intro": "Koeleria linkii, commonly known as the Tibetan feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It features slender, wiry stems and fine, needle-like leaves that give it a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Koeleria linkii is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
