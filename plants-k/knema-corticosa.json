It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels off in thin layers. The plant has simple, elliptical leaves that are glossy and arranged alternately on the stems. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are borne in clusters and are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds.
