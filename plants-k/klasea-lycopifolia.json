    "intro": "Klasea lycopifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf lycopod, is a unique fern-like plant native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It features a creeping rhizome with dense clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves that are often bright green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its leaves, typical of the lycopod group. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its distinct morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists studying ancient plant lineages."
