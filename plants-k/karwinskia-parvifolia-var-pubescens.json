    "intro": "Karwinskia parvifolia var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent karwinskia, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, making it well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover. The varietal name \"pubescens\" refers to the pubescent (hairy) nature of its foliage, which is a distinguishing feature of this botanical variant."
