It is characterized by its striking, spiky flower heads and silver-blue foliage, which are adapted to coastal environments. The plants typically grow in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines, thriving in saline conditions. Kmeria species are often found in temperate regions, particularly in the Mediterranean and along the Atlantic coasts. Their unique morphology makes them popular in coastal gardens and as ornamental plants."
