    "intro": "Kendrickia walkeri, commonly known as the African daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are fleshy and covered in a powdery white coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is a succulent, meaning it stores water in its leaves and stems, making it drought-tolerant. This plant thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
