    "intro": "Kadua cordata subsp. waimeae, commonly known as the Waimea false hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforest understories, and is often found on the islands of Oahu and Maui. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom during the summer months and attract various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
