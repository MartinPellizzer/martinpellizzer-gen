    "intro": "Keiri, commonly known as the blueberry plant, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of the Americas. It produces small, round berries that are rich in antioxidants and have a sweet, slightly tart flavor. The plant has a shallow root system and thrives in well-drained, acidic soil. Keiri flowers are white and bell-shaped, appearing in the spring before the leaves emerge. It is often cultivated for both its ornamental value and its edible fruits."
