It is characterized by its distinctive rosette growth pattern and striking, often blue or purple, foliage. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires ample sunlight to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
