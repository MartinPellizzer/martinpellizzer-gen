    "intro": "Kohautia longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered kohautia, is a species of flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny white to pale blue flowers. Kohautia longiflora is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream sides. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
