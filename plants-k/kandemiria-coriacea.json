    "intro": "Kandemiria coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved kandemiria, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Kandemiria coriacea is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies for centuries."
