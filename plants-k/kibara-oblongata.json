    "intro": "Kibara oblongata, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green foliage and clusters of showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are broad and oval-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Kibara oblongata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
