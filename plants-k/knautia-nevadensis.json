    "intro": "Knautia nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra Knautia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, bract-like structures that support its flower heads. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
