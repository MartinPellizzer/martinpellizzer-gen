    "intro": "Kunzea juniperoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf kunzea, is a small evergreen shrub native to Australia. It typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, often found in heathlands and coastal scrub. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and glossy, giving it a resemblance to juniper. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, followed by blue-black berries that are edible for birds. Kunzea juniperoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh coastal conditions."
