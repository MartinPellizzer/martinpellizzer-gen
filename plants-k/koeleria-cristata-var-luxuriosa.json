    "intro": "Koeleria cristata var. luxuriosa, commonly known as the velvetgrass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its distinctive, fluffy seed heads that resemble a crown, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in early spring, which are clustered in spikes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its soft, feathery appearance and its ability to attract pollinators."
