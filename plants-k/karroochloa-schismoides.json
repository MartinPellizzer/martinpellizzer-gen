    "intro": "Karroochloa schismoides, commonly known as the Western sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the western United States. It is characterized by its sword-shaped, leathery fronds that can grow up to two meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. Karroochloa schismoides plays a significant ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various small organisms."
