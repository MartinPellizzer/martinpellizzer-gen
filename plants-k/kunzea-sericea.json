    "intro": "Kunzea sericea, commonly known as silver kunzea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in winter, attracting native pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures that provide additional protection against harsh coastal conditions. Kunzea sericea is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
