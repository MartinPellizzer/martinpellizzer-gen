    "intro": "Kielmeyera abdita var. linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf kielmeyera, is a species native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
