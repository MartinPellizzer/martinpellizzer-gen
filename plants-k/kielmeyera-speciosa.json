    "intro": "Kielmeyera speciosa, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its acoustic properties and used in the construction of musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with multiple leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Kielmeyera speciosa is now classified as endangered in many regions."
