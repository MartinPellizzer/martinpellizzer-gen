    "intro": "Koeleria skorpilii, commonly known as the Scorpil grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and rocky environments, showcasing drought tolerance and efficient water use. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Koeleria skorpilii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest in ecological restoration projects."
