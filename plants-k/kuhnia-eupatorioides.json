    "intro": "Kuhnia eupatorioides, commonly known as the marsh woundwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in dense spikes, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Kuhnia eupatorioides plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and nectar for various insects."
