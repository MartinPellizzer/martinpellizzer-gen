    "intro": "Karatas cyanea, commonly known as the blue karatas, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, seed-containing pods after flowering. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and drought tolerance."
