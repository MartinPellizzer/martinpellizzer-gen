    "intro": "Krameria parvifolia var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular krameria, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Cactaceae family, characterized by its succulent stems and spiny structures. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise rugged appearance. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, a common adaptation to minimize water loss in dry environments. The glandular hairs on its stems and leaves contribute to its unique appearance and may play a role in deterring herbivores."
