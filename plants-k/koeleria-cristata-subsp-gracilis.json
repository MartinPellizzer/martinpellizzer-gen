    "intro": "Koeleria cristata subsp. gracilis, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically forms dense, tufted clumps with fine, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, silky bloom. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental appearance and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
