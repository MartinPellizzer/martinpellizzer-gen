    "intro": "Koeleria ciliata f. rigidiuscula, commonly known as the stiff-haired grass, is a horticultural form of a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are distinctly hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a desirable addition to drought-tolerant landscapes."
