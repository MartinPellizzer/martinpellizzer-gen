    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis var. flaccida, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a ground cover in landscaping."
