    "intro": "Knema losirensis, commonly known as the Borneo ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its dense, heavy timber that is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, Knema losirensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and overharvesting."
