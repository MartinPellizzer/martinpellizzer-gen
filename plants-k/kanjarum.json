    "intro": "Kanjarum, commonly known as the Indian nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is native to India and is characterized by its small, dark purple berries that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant has hairy leaves and produces clusters of white flowers that bloom in the summer. Its berries contain alkaloids and are used in Ayurvedic practices for their purported medicinal properties. However, the plant is toxic in its raw form and requires careful preparation before use."
