    "intro": "Kohleria kalbreyeri, commonly known as the Kalbreyer's kohleria, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub with broad, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Kohleria kalbreyeri is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
