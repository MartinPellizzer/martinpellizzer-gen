    "intro": "Kotschya strigosa, commonly known as the desert thornapple, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of North America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically green when mature, containing seeds within a fleshy pulp. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Kotschya strigosa is often found in deserts and along rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife."
