    "intro": "Katherinea perakensis, commonly known as the Perak mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the tropical rainforests of Malaysia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and intricate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its growth is slow, and it is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in the undergrowth. Due to habitat loss, Katherinea perakensis is considered a vulnerable species, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
