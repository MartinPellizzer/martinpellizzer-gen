    "intro": "Kohautia caespitosa var. hispidula, commonly known as the hairy kohautia, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered with fine hairs, giving the plant its \"hairy\" appearance. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as along streambanks or in forest understories. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates."
