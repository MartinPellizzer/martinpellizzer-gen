    "intro": "Knautia collina subsp. longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered knautia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces tall, branched stems bearing numerous pink to purple, fluffy flowers. Its bloom period occurs from late spring to early summer, making it a valuable addition to wildflower gardens. The subspecies is distinguished by its longer floral stems and more open inflorescences compared to other knautia species."
