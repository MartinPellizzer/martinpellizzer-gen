It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and delicate, feathery inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, dry conditions. Its small, pale blue to purple flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Koeleria parreisziana is a hardy perennial that is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
