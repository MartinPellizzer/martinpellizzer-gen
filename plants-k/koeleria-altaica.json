    "intro": "Koeleria altaica, commonly known as the Altai needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine and steppe environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue or purple flowers. It is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, including low temperatures and strong winds. Koeleria altaica plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
