It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than an inch in length. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Its botanical features make it well adapted to drought conditions and full sun exposure."
