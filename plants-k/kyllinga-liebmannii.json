It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often forming dense stands in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces edible, starchy tubers that are sometimes used in local cuisines. Kyllinga liebmannii is also valued for its ornamental appeal due to its striking foliage."
