    "intro": "Kadua cordata var. opaca, commonly known as the opaque cordate kadua, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dark green, cordate (heart-shaped) leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom during the summer months. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
