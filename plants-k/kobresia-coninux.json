    "intro": "Kobresia coninux, commonly known as the Tibetan feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and strong winds. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with fine, silky leaves that form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its harsh habitat. It is often found in alpine meadows and is an important component of the local ecosystem. Kobresia coninux plays a vital role in preventing soil erosion and maintaining biodiversity in its native environment."
