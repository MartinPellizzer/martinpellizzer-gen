    "intro": "Kadsura borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean kadsura, is a climbing plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Aristolochiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and intricate, mottled foliage. The plant produces showy, spiral-shaped flowers that are often greenish or reddish in color, which are adapted for specific pollinators. It is typically found growing on trees or shrubs in the understorey of dense tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
