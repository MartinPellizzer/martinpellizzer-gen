    "intro": "Kneiffia tetragona var. longistipata, commonly known as the long-stemmed four-angled grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant taxonomy."
