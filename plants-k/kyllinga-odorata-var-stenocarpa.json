    "intro": "Kyllinga odorata var. stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited swamp kyllinga, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to saturated soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of small, clustered spikelets that produce tiny, white or pale pink flowers. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that contains several small seeds, which are dispersed by water or wind."
