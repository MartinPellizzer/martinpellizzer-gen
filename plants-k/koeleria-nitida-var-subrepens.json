    "intro": "Koeleria nitida var. subrepens, commonly known as silvergrass or silky grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features fine, silver-gray foliage that is densely packed, giving it a soft, mat-like appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and ability to form dense, low-maintenance clumps."
