    "intro": "Kohautia ubangensis, commonly known as the Ubangensis fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense rainforest understories. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of interest for both horticultural and scientific study. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
