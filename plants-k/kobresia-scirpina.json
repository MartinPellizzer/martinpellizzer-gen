    "intro": "Kobresia scirpina, commonly known as the tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Kobresia scirpina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine flora and fauna."
