    "intro": "Koeleria tenuipes, commonly known as the slenderleaf grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically forms dense mats of fine, needle-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in dry, rocky or sandy soils. It is well adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant. Koeleria tenuipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
