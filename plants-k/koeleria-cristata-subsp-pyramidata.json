    "intro": "Koeleria cristata subsp. pyramidata, commonly known as the mountain grass or tufted grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue to white flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
