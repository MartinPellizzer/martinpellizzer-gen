    "intro": "Kochia massonii, commonly known as Chinese cocklebur, is an annual herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that turn red or purple in autumn. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a spherical inflorescence called a head. Its seeds are enclosed in spiny, inflated fruits that aid in wind dispersal. Kochia massonii is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
