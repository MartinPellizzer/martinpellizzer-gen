It is a small shrub characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas within tropical forests. It has a woody stem with smooth, greyish bark and produces small, elliptical fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
