It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 60 cm in height, adorned with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in panicle-like inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
