    "intro": "Kieslingia, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Malvaceae family. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Kieslingia species are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. They have succulent leaves and stems, which help them retain water in harsh environments. The genus includes several species, such as Kieslingia leucophaea, which is known for its striking white flowers and drought tolerance."
