    "intro": "Koeleria cenisia, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features narrow, silver-blue leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Koeleria cenisia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, silver foliage."
