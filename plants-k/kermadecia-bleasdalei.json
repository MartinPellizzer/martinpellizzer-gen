    "intro": "Kermadecia bleasdalei, commonly known as the Kermadec lichen, is a rare and unique plant endemic to the Kermadec Islands in the South Pacific. It is a lichen, a composite organism formed by the symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. This plant thrives in the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat, often growing on rock surfaces or tree trunks. Its structure is simple, consisting of a thallus that can be crust-like or foliose in form. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, Kermadecia bleasdalei is considered a vulnerable species."
