    "intro": "Kennedynella elongata, commonly known as the slender ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the wet tropical forests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its rarity and specific environmental requirements, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change."
