    "intro": "Korthalsella japonica f. grayi, commonly known as the gray form of the Japanese korthalsella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers are usually pink or white in color. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
