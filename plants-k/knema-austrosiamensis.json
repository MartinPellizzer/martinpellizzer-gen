    "intro": "Knema austrosiamensis, commonly known as the Sunda knema, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by oval, red or orange fruits. It thrives in tropical rainforests and is often found in lowland and hill forest regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
