It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by round, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. Knema conica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage and ecological significance."
