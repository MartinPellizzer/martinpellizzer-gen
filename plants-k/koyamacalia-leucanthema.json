    "intro": "Koyamacalia leucanthema, commonly known as the white-flowered koyama, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, white petals and compact growth habit, often growing in shaded, moist environments. The plant belongs to the family Campanulaceae, which includes bellflowers, and is known for its showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
