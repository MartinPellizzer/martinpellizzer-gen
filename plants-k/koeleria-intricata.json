    "intro": "Koeleria intricata, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features fine, needle-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in cold, nutrient-poor soils. It is often found in tundra and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Koeleria intricata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
