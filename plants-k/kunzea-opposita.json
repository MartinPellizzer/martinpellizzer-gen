    "intro": "Kunzea opposita, commonly known as coastal tea tree, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils, often found along the shores of southern and eastern Australia. Its leaves are used in traditional Aboriginal medicine and for making tea. Kunzea opposita is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
