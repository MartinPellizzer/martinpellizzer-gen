    "intro": "Kaempferia gigantiphylla, commonly known as the giant flame orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter, with vibrant red and orange hues. The plant typically grows as a rhizomatous herb, with broad, strap-like leaves that form a rosette. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation and botanical collections."
