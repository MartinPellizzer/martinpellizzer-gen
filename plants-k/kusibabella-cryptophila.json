    "intro": "Kusibabella cryptophila, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are small, white, and fragrant, typically blooming during the rainy season. The plant has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its habitat specificity and declining environment, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
