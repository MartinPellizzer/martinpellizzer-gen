    "intro": "Koanophyllon monanthum, commonly known as the single-flowered koan, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, and it has a compact, mat-forming growth habit. Koanophyllon monanthum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems and waxy leaves to reduce water loss. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as habitat for small invertebrates."
