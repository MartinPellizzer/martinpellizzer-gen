    "intro": "Kengia serotina var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous kengia, is a rare and intriguing plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its unique viviparous reproduction, where seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant. The plant typically grows as a shrub with small, elliptical leaves and produces clusters of small, white flowers. Its botanical significance lies in its rare reproductive strategy and potential ecological adaptations to its native environment."
