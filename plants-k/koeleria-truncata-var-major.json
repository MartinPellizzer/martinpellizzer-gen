    "intro": "Koeleria truncata var. major, commonly known as the rough bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green blades that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or whitish flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and prairies. Koeleria truncata var. major is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining ecological balance in native plant communities."
