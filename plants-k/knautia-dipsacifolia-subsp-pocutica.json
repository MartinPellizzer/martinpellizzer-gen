    "intro": "Knautia dipsacifolia subsp. pocutica, commonly known as the alpine knautia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flower heads that are arranged in spherical clusters, resembling small, rounded umbels. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
