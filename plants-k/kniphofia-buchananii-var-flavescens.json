    "intro": "Kniphofia buchananii var. flavescens, commonly known as the golden torch lily, is a striking perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features tall, upright stems adorned with vibrant orange to yellow inflorescences that resemble torches, blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adding a striking contrast to its bright flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
