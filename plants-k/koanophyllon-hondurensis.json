    "intro": "Koanophyllon hondurensis, commonly known as the Honduran leafy spurge, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or disturbed soils. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Koanophyllon hondurensis is considered a minor weed in some regions but plays a role in local ecosystems."
