    "intro": "Karatas scheremetiewii, commonly known as the Scheremetiew's karatas, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking, daisy-like flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, showcasing adaptations to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Karatas scheremetiewii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
