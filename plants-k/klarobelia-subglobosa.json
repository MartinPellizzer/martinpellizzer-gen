    "intro": "Klarobelia subglobosa, commonly known as the globular lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It is a foliose lichen, meaning it has a leaf-like structure with a distinct upper and lower surface. The plant forms a dense, rounded growth that is typically found on bark or stone in moist, shaded environments. Its thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria. This lichen is notable for its slow growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions."
