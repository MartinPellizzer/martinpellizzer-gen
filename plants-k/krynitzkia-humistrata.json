    "intro": "Krynitzkia humistrata, commonly known as the coastal sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is a small, herbaceous shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Krynitzkia humistrata is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds, making it a resilient species in its native environment."
