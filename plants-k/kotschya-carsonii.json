    "intro": "Kotschya carsonii, commonly known as Carson's kotschya, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Kotschya carsonii is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions."
