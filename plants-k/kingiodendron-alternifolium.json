    "intro": "Kingiodendron alternifolium, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It has opposite, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries, which are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
