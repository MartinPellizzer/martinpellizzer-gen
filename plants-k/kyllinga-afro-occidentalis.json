    "intro": "Kyllinga afro-occidentalis, commonly known as African arrowhead, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant has arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often floating or semi-submerged, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, and it produces tiny, three-lobed seeds. Kyllinga afro-occidentalis is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native habitats."
