    "intro": "Keraskomion, commonly known as the blue poppy, is a striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its vibrant blue or violet petals that resemble those of the traditional poppy. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss. The Keraskomion is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique and eye-catching blooms."
