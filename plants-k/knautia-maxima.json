    "intro": "Knautia maxima, commonly known as the giant knautia, is a tall, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It features showy, pink to purple flower heads that resemble thistles, arranged in dense, spherical clusters. The plant has deeply lobed, gray-green leaves that are hairy and covered in fine, white pubescence. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Knautia maxima is valued in gardens for its dramatic floral display and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
