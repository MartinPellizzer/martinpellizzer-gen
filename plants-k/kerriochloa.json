    "intro": "Kerriochloa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It consists of several species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. These plants are typically herbaceous, with slender stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often arranged in a dense, tufted growth habit. Kerriochloa species are adapted to grow in well-drained soils and are often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and forest margins. They play a minor role in local ecosystems but are valued for their ornamental appeal in some horticultural contexts."
