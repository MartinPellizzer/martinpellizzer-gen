These plants are native to Europe, western Asia, and parts of North Africa, and they typically thrive in meadows and grasslands. Knautia species are characterized by their showy, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often resembling small, fluffy balls. The leaves are usually hairy and lance-shaped, and the plants can grow from 30 to 120 centimeters tall. Many species are cultivated in gardens for their ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
