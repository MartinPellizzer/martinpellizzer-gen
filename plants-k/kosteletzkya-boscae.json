    "intro": "Kosteletzkya boscae, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy, coastal environments, often found in dunes and salt marshes. The plant features heart-shaped, waxy leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue to violet in color. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. Kosteletzkya boscae is adapted to tolerate salt spray and is an important species in coastal ecosystem restoration efforts."
