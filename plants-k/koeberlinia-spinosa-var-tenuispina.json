It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its unique morphology and resilience make it a notable species in its native habitat."
