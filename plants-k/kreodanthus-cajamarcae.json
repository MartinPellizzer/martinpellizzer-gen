    "intro": "Kreodanthus cajamarcae, commonly known as the Peruvian candleplant, is a unique flowering plant native to the Andean region of Peru. It is characterized by its striking, candle-like inflorescences that resemble small, upright torches. The plant belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is known for its vibrant, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Kreodanthus cajamarcae thrives in high-altitude environments, typically growing in rocky or sandy soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
