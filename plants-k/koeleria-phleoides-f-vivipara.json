    "intro": "Koeleria phleoides f. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous Koeleria, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is notable for its viviparous reproduction, where new plants develop from the base of the mother plant, allowing for rapid propagation. It typically thrives in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky soils. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique reproductive strategy and ecological adaptability."
