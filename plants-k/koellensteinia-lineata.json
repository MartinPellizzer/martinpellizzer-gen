    "intro": "Koellensteinia lineata, commonly known as the slender rock orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Koellensteinia lineata is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is valued for its unique appearance and ecological significance in its native habitat."
