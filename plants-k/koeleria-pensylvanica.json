    "intro": "Koeleria pensylvanica, commonly known as Pennsylvania grass, is a perennial grass species native to the northeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife. Koeleria pensylvanica is also used in restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience in wetland environments."
