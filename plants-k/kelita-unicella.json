    "intro": "Kelita unicella, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance with slender stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in areas with poor drainage. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the waterlogged substrate, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Kelita unicella is often found in association with other wetland flora, contributing to the biodiversity of these habitats."
