    "intro": "Krameria acuminata, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Krameria acuminata is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
