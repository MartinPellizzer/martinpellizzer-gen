    "intro": "Kentrophyllum aureum, commonly known as the golden kentrophyllum, is a rare and striking plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which bloom in dense clusters during the late summer months. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its unique appearance makes it a popular subject in botanical gardens and conservation efforts. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human encroachment."
