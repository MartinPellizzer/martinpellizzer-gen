It is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots help stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. It is adapted to salt spray and harsh coastal conditions, making it an important part of coastal ecosystems."
