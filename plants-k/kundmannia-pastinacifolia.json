    "intro": "Kundmannia pastinacifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshes of Europe. It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and pointed, with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. Kundmannia pastinacifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting aquatic ecosystems."
