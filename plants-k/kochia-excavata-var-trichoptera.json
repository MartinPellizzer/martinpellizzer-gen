    "intro": "Kochia excavata var. trichoptera, commonly known as the silverleaf kochia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its succulent, silver-gray foliage that reflects light and reduces water loss, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in dry fields, and is adapted to thrive in full sun. Kochia excavata var. trichoptera is a member of the amaranth family (Amaranthaceae) and is known for its drought tolerance and ability to reseed readily."
