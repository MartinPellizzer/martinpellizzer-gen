    "intro": "Koeleria spicata subsp. mollis, commonly known as the soft spikegrass, is a perennial grass native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and sandy soils. The plant features slender, tufted stems with dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often pale green to blue-gray in color. Its leaves are soft and hairy, contributing to its common name, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
