    "intro": "Kyllinga carinalaevis, commonly known as the coastal kyllinga, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, grass-like growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and periodic inundation. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh coastal conditions. Kyllinga carinalaevis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens."
