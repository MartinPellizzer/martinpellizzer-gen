    "intro": "Knautia mimica, commonly known as the mimic knautia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Knautia mimica is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to thrive in high-altitude environments."
