    "intro": "Koeleria cristata var. vestita, commonly known as the velvet grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive, fluffy seed heads that resemble small, soft clouds. The plant thrives in cold, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine, silky hairs, contributing to its soft texture. This species is well adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine and tundra ecosystems."
