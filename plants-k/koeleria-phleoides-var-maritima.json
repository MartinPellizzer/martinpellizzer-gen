    "intro": "Koeleria phleoides var. maritima, commonly known as sea wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to coastal areas of the northern hemisphere. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and salt marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to harsh coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. This species plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and preventing erosion."
