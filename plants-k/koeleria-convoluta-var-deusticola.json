    "intro": "Koeleria convoluta var. deusticola, commonly known as the Alaska hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with fine, soft, and slightly hairy leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is an important component of the vegetation in cold, high-altitude environments."
