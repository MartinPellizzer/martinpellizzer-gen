    "intro": "Koanophyllon tetranthum, commonly known as the four-flowered koan, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. The small, yellow flowers bloom in spring and are followed by bracts that persist into the winter, providing visual interest throughout the year."
