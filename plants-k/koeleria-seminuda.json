    "intro": "Koeleria seminuda, commonly known as the slender koeleria, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor soil conditions. Its flowers are usually pale blue or greenish in color, and it blooms during the short growing season. Koeleria seminuda plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
