    "intro": "Koenigia nummulariifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf saxifrage, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, silver-gray leaves that are oval to round in shape, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and as a decorative plant in cooler climates."
