    "intro": "Kadsura sulphurea, commonly known as the golden kadsura, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that often have a faint yellow or golden hue on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
