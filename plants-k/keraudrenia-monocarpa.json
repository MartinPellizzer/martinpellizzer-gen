    "intro": "Keraudrenia monocarpa, commonly known as the single-seeded orchid, is a rare and unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its single, large, fleshy seed pod that contains a single seed, a feature that distinguishes it from most other orchids. The plant is native to Madagascar and is adapted to grow in rocky, arid environments. Its flowers are typically greenish-white with a distinctive, elongated shape. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
