    "intro": "Koeleria discolor, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial grass that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pink or purple flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid environments. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive and drought-tolerant addition to native plant gardens."
