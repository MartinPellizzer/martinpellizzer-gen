    "intro": "Krameria erecta, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in racemes at the ends of the branches. Krameria erecta is adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in sandy or rocky soils. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration in desert environments."
