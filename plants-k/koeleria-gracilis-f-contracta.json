    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis f. contracta, commonly known as the compact koeleria, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features fine, silver-gray foliage with a dense, mat-forming growth habit, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flower spikes in early summer, adding a delicate floral display. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a desirable ornamental plant in dry climates. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires minimal water once established."
