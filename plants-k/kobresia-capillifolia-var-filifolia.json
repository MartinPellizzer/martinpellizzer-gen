    "intro": "Kobresia capillifolia var. filifolia, commonly known as the silky hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine and arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fine, soft, hair-like leaves that give it a silky appearance. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spike-like inflorescences. This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems."
