It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect, grass-like stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, spiky flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Kyllinga ruwenzoriensis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous grasslands. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
