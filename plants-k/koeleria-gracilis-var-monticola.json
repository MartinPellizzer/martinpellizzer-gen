    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis var. monticola, commonly known as mountain slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and has slender, wiry stems with fine, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Koeleria gracilis var. monticola is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
