    "intro": "Kalanchoe marmorata var. marmorata, commonly known as the marble plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow during the winter months. Its leaves are also known for their ability to propagate new plants through basal offsets. This species is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
