It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers and hairy, lobed leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It typically grows in rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Koanophyllon lobatifolium plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and provides nectar for pollinators."
