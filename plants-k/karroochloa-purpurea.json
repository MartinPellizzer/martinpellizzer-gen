    "intro": "Karroochloa purpurea, commonly known as the purple mountain mint, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. Its showy, clustered purple flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Karroochloa purpurea is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
