    "intro": "Kobresia royleana var. paniculata, commonly known as the Kashmir grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the cold regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in high-altitude environments with poor soil conditions and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions."
