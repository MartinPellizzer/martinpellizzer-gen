    "intro": "Kunzea linearis, commonly known as narrow-leaved kunzea, is a small evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Kunzea linearis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native gardens."
