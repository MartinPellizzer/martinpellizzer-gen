    "intro": "Kochia ciliata, commonly known as the velvetleaf kochia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant produces distinctive, spiny bracts that enclose its tiny blooms, giving it a unique appearance. Kochia ciliata is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid environments due to its drought tolerance. It is also known for its ability to spread through seeds dispersed by wind."
