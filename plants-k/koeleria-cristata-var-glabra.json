    "intro": "Koeleria cristata var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth tufted grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairless or nearly so. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are usually greenish or pale blue in color. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small invertebrates."
