    "intro": "Klasea serratuloides, commonly known as the roughleaf klasea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant has serrated, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Klasea serratuloides is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system that helps it survive in drought conditions."
