    "intro": "Katherinea parvula, commonly known as the dwarf katherinea, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Central America. It features compact, glossy dark green leaves that are ovate in shape and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. Katherinea parvula thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for container gardening or as a landscape accent. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice among gardeners seeking to add texture and color to their gardens."
