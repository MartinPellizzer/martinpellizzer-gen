    "intro": "Kohautia longifolia var. vestita, commonly known as the velvet kohautia, is a rare and striking member of the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that is covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
