It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
