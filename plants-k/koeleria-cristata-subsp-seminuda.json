    "intro": "Koeleria cristata subsp. seminuda, commonly known as the slender tufted grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
