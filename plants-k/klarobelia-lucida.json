    "intro": "Klarobelia lucida, commonly known as the shining ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and striking, star-shaped flowers that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks without deriving nutrients from its host. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Klarobelia lucida is considered endangered and is protected in several regions."
