    "intro": "Koeleria eriostachya var. altaica, commonly known as the Altai grass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, typically forming dense mats or tufts. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or steppe environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid or semi-arid regions."
