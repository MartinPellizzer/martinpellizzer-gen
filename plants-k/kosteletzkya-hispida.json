    "intro": "Kosteletzkya hispida, commonly known as the rough sea oxeye, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the United States and parts of Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or dune environments, thriving in saline and well-drained soils. The plant features showy yellow flowers with prominent orange centers, which bloom from summer to fall. Its leaves are hairy and narrow, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh coastal conditions. Kosteletzkya hispida plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
