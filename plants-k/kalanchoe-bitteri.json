    "intro": "Kalanchoe bitteri, commonly known as the silver leaf kalanchoe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves covered in a powdery white coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers during the winter months, adding visual interest to gardens. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for xeriscaping. Kalanchoe bitteri is also known for its ability to propagate through offsets, which can be easily separated and replanted."
