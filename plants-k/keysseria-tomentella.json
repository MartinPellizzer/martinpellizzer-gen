    "intro": "Keysseria tomentella, commonly known as the wooly keysseria, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
