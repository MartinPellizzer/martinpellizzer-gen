    "intro": "Kochia sedifolia, commonly known as burning bush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the amaranth family (Amaranthaceae) and is characterized by its striking red or purple foliage that turns vibrant in the fall. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in dense, fluffy heads, which appear in late summer to early fall. Kochia sedifolia is a perennial shrub that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping, though it can become invasive in some regions."
