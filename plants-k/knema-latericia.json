    "intro": "Knema latericia, commonly known as the yellow knema, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in local medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Knema latericia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
