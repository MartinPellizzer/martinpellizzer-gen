    "intro": "Kobresia trinervis var. foliosa, commonly known as the leafy kobresia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine and arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Poaceae family, commonly referred to as grasses, and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or gray pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. It produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. Kobresia trinervis var. foliosa is well adapted to harsh climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations."
