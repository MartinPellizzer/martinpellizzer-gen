    "intro": "Koeleria antarctica, commonly known as Antarctic grass, is a flowering plant native to the cold climates of the Southern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in harsh environments such as Antarctica and sub-Antarctic islands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like flower clusters. It is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme cold temperatures. Its resilience makes it an important component of the ecosystems in polar regions."
