    "intro": "Kickxia lasiopoda, commonly known as the woolly knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a basal rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white or pinkish flowers during the spring and early summer. Its fibrous root system helps it thrive in rocky or sandy soils. Kickxia lasiopoda is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and slopes."
