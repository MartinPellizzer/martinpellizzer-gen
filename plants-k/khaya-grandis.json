    "intro": "Khaya grandis, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a tropical hardwood species native to central and western Africa. It is a large, deciduous tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a broad, spreading canopy. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, edible seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a velvety texture, while its bark is thick and often fissured. The plant is valued for its durable timber, which is used in furniture and construction, as well as for its seeds, which are processed into shea butter."
