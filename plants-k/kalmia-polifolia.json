    "intro": "Kalmia polifolia, commonly known as the bog rosemary, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the wetlands and bogs of eastern North America. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and requires consistent moisture. Kalmia polifolia plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators in its native environment."
