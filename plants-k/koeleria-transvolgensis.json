    "intro": "Koeleria transvolgensis, commonly known as the Transvolg grass, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded ecosystems."
