    "intro": "Kleinia odora, commonly known as the sweet-scented ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that form a dense, mat-like growth. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its aromatic leaves release a sweet scent when crushed, adding to its ornamental value."
