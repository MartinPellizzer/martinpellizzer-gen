    "intro": "Khaosokia caricoides, commonly known as the giant arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant produces large, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to several meters in length, making it a striking ornamental species. Its rhizomes are edible and have been used in traditional cuisines for their starchy texture. However, due to its invasive potential, it is often restricted in cultivation outside its native range."
