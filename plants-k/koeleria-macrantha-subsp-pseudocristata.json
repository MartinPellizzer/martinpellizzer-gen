    "intro": "Koeleria macrantha subsp. pseudocristata, commonly known as the crested wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive, flattened, crested appearance due to the arrangement of its leaf blades. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its flowering spikes are usually slender and bear small, spikelet-based flowers. This subspecies is valued for its drought tolerance and is often used in ecological restoration and erosion control."
