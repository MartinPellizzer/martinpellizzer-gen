    "intro": "Ketmia syrorum, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white, yellow, and orange. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area. Its flowers are typically pollinated by insects, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Ketmia syrorum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
