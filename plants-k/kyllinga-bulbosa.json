It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, clustered inflorescences. Kyllinga bulbosa typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
