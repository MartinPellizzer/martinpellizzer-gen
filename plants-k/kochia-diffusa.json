    "intro": "Kochia diffusa, commonly known as burning bush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy bracts that change color throughout the growing season, ranging from green to red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical heads. Kochia diffusa is a short-lived perennial that thrives in full sun and well-drained soils. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners, though it can become invasive in some regions."
