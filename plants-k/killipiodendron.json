    "intro": "Killipiodendron, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It features large, broad leaves that can span up to three meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still water. The plant's roots are anchored in the muddy substrate, absorbing nutrients from the water. Its flowers, which bloom at night, are pale yellow and attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Killipiodendron plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms."
