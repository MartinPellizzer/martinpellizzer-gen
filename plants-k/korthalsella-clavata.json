    "intro": "Korthalsella clavata, commonly known as the knobbed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually simple and opposite, with a distinctive knob-like protrusion on the stem. Korthalsella clavata is a carnivorous plant that relies on capturing prey to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters."
