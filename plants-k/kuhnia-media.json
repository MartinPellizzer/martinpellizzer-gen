    "intro": "Kuhnia media, commonly known as the silver sword, is a striking succulent native to the Canary Islands. It features a rosette of fleshy, silver-blue leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a frosty appearance. The plant produces tall, branching stems that bear small, greenish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, Kuhnia media is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
