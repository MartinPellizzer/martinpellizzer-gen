    "intro": "Knowltonia hepaticifolia, commonly known as the liverleaf, is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which give it its common name, and its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a sprawling growth habit with trailing stems that can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds."
