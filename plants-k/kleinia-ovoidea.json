    "intro": "Kleinia ovoidea, commonly known as the egg-shaped Kleinia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, commonly referred to as the ice plant family. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder. Its small, star-shaped flowers are typically yellow or orange, blooming in spring. Kleinia ovoidea is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems to survive dry conditions."
