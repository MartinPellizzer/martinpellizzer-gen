    "intro": "Kumlienia cooleyae, commonly known as the Cooley's kumlienia, is a rare and endangered evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, woody fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is typically found in shaded, forested areas. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
