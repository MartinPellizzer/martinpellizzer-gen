It is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves that are typically 15\u201330 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, followed by spiky, red berries that mature in late summer. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in shaded garden environments."
