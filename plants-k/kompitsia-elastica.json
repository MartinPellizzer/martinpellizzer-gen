    "intro": "Kompitsia elastica, commonly known as the elastic kompitsia, is a unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, flexible stems that can bend significantly without breaking, a trait that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. Kompitsia elastica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been studied for its potential in ecological restoration projects."
