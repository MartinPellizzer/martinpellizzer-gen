    "intro": "Kokia lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf kokia, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a small shrub that typically grows in coastal areas, characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lanceolate, giving it its scientific name, and it is known for its ornamental value in gardens. Kokia lanceolata is also valued for its ecological role in supporting native insect populations."
