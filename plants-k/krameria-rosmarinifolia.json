    "intro": "Krameria rosmarinifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf krameria, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in spring. It belongs to the family Cactaceae, although it is not a true cactus. Krameria rosmarinifolia is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun."
