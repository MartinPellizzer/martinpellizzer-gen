    "intro": "Kobresia tibetica subsp. littledalei, commonly known as the Tibetan kobresia, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. This subspecies thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native range. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying high-altitude plant adaptations."
