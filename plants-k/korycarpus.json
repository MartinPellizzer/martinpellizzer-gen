    "intro": "Korycarpus, commonly known as the African starfruit or carambola, is a tropical fruit-bearing plant native to Southeast Asia and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive five-pointed star shape when sliced, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into the bright orange, five-lobed fruits. The fruit's skin is thin and edible, while the pulp is juicy and tart with a sweet aroma. Korycarpus thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its flavorful fruit."
