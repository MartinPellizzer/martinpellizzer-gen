    "intro": "Kraussia congesta, commonly known as the yellow stinkwood, is a South African tree species belonging to the family Rhamnaceae. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and dark green, opposite leaves that are often clustered at the base of the branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by small, red berries. Kraussia congesta is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. It is also valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of incense."
