    "intro": "Koeleria albovii, commonly known as the whiteflower bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and small, white to pale blue flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a clump-forming growth habit and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. Koeleria albovii is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
