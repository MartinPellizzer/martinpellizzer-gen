    "intro": "Koanophyllon jenssenii, commonly known as the Jenssen's leafy cactus, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. Its flowers, which are often blue or violet in color, bloom during the cooler months and attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Koanophyllon jenssenii is considered a species of conservation concern."
