    "intro": "Kerneria dubia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a striking member of the Acanthaceae family native to the tropical regions of South America. This perennial herb is characterized by its unique, bell-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, elongated fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, Kerneria dubia is a sought-after plant in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
