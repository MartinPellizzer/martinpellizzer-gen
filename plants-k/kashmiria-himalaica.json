    "intro": "Kashmiria himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan Kashmiria, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink petals and thorny stems. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. It produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
