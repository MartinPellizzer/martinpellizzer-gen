    "intro": "Keramanthus, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Nelumbonaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, buoyant stalks. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of water, while its roots are submerged. Keramanthus is often associated with spiritual and cultural significance in various Asian traditions. Its flowers typically open at dawn and close at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty."
