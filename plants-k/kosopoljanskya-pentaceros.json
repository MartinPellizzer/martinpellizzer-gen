It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant has long, thin stems that root at the base and float on the water's surface. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often forming a rosette near the water's edge. It thrives in shallow, still freshwater environments and is considered an indicator species for clean, unpolluted water."
