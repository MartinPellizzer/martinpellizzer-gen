    "intro": "Koeleria phleoides, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It typically grows in rocky, arid, or alpine environments, demonstrating a high degree of adaptability to harsh conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Koeleria phleoides is also of interest to botanists for its genetic diversity and ecological significance in its native habitats."
