    "intro": "Karivia sinuosa, commonly known as the wavy karivia, is a tropical shrub native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its sinuous, wavy leaf margins, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible, berry-like fruits. Karivia sinuosa is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Its growth habit and foliage make it a popular choice for horticultural use in tropical gardens."
