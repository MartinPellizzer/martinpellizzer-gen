    "intro": "Kalopanax ricinifolius var. typicum, commonly known as the Chinese cow parsley or Chinese giant arrowhead, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features large, palmately compound leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in umbels. The plant produces toxic seeds that contain ricin, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Its botanical characteristics make it both ecologically significant and a plant to handle with care."
