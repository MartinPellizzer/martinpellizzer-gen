    "intro": "Koniga fruticosa, commonly known as the purple-flowered shrub, is a perennial plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and clusters of small, violet-colored flowers that bloom throughout the warm seasons. The plant has small, elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it often grows in moist, shaded environments. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that contains a single seed, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine. The botanical features of Koniga fruticosa make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and horticultural research."
