    "intro": "Kielmeyera petiolaris, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and long, slender leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by round, red berries containing several seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its rich color and durability, though it is also used in horticulture for its ornamental appeal. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
