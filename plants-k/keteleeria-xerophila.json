    "intro": "Keteleeria xerophila, commonly known as the desert fir, is a rare and endemic species native to the arid regions of southern China. It is a member of the Cupressaceae family and exhibits typical xerophytic adaptations, such as thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several decades, making it a long-lived species in its harsh environment. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Keteleeria xerophila is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
