    "intro": "Kunzea eriocalyx, commonly known as the narrow-leaved kunzea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, pale yellow to cream-colored flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. It has a compact growth habit and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to coastal environments. Kunzea eriocalyx is also valued for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental appeal."
