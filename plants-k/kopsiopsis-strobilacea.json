    "intro": "Kopsiopsis strobilacea, commonly known as the clustered clubmoss, is a species of lycopod that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and its scale-like leaves. Native to the moist, shaded environments of tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in humid, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the spores for reproduction. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
