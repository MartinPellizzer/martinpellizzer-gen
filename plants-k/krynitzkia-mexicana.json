It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a low shrub with gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the spring and early summer. Krynitzkia mexicana is adapted to survive in dry conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
