It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, feathery plumes that give it a soft, airy appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or arid environments. It produces small, pale blue or greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. Koeleria peruviana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique visual characteristics."
