    "intro": "Koeleria pseudocristata var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved tufted grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form compact clumps. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a blue-green hue, and the plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine habitats."
