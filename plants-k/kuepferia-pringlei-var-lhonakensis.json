    "intro": "Kuepferia pringlei var. lhonakensis, commonly known as the Lhonakensis kuepferia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant exhibits a rosette growth habit, with thick, fleshy leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
