    "intro": "Kunstleria borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean kunstleria, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has narrow, linear leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a panicle, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
