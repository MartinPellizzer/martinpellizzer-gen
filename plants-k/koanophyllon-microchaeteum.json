    "intro": "Koanophyllon microchaeteum, commonly known as the small-hairy leaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance, and its small yellow flowers bloom in the spring. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
