It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a sharp, pointed tip. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered in loose, open panicles. Koeleria pungens is valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in restoration ecology projects."
