    "intro": "Kamiella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, and it produces small, fragrant blooms that typically appear in late summer. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Kamiella is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
