    "intro": "Keteleeria fortunei, commonly known as the Chinese fir, is a coniferous tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Pinaceae and is characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a broad, pyramidal crown. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against environmental stress. The cones are woody and typically contain two to three seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
