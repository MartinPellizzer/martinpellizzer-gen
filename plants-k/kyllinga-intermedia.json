    "intro": "Kyllinga intermedia, commonly known as swamp spikerush, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, forming dense stands that help stabilize aquatic ecosystems. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of white or pale pink flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common component of marshes and pond edges. Kyllinga intermedia plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
