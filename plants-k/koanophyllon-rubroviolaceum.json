    "intro": "Koanophyllon rubroviolaceum, commonly known as the purple viola grass, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads made up of many small florets. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Koanophyllon rubroviolaceum is often found in rocky soils and dry slopes, thriving in full sun conditions."
