    "intro": "Karivia samoensis var. vitiensis, commonly known as the Vitiensis Karivia, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Vanuatu and Fiji. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal or lowland areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
