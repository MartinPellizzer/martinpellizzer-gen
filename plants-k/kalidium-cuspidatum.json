    "intro": "Kalidium cuspidatum, commonly known as the spiny grass or spike grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems that often bear sharp, spiny bracts. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, followed by narrow, grass-like leaves. Kalidium cuspidatum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for dry, arid environments. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
