    "intro": "Koeleria oreophila subsp. oreophila, commonly known as the mountain koeleria, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the western United States. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are usually pale blue or purple, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
