    "intro": "Kaluhaburunghos lanceolatus, commonly known as the lanceolate fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and glossy. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture in its soil. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves. Kaluhaburunghos lanceolatus is often cultivated for its ornamental value in indoor and outdoor gardens."
