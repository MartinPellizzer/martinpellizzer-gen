    "intro": "Kohleria allenii, commonly known as the Allen's kohleria, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its semi-arid habitat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Kohleria allenii is popular among gardeners for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
