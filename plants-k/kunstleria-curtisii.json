    "intro": "Kunstleria curtisii, commonly known as the desert gentian, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it often forms dense clumps that help retain moisture. Kunstleria curtisii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
