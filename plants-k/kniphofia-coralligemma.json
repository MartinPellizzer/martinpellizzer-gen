It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that bear clusters of bright red, orange, or yellow tubular flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has strap-like, grassy foliage that forms a dense, basal rosette. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.
