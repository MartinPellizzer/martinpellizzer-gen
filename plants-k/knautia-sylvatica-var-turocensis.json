    "intro": "Knautia sylvatica var. turocensis, commonly known as the Turoc Valley knautia, is a perennial herb native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and often have a reddish tinge. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to alpine and subalpine environments. This variant is less common than the typical form of Knautia sylvatica and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
