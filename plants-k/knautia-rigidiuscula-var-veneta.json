It features upright, hairy stems that bear clusters of pink to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged flowering period and ability to attract pollinators."
