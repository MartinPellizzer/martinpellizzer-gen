    "intro": "Krokia podocarpoides, commonly known as the African silver fern, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the high altitudes of South Africa. It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae, which includes conifer-like evergreen trees and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its distinctive silver-green foliage, which is covered in fine, scale-like leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Krokia podocarpoides is considered a vulnerable species."
