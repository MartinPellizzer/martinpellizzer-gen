    "intro": "Koeleria hispanica, commonly known as Spanish grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of hairs. Koeleria hispanica is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
