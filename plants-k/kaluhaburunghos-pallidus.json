    "intro": "Kaluhaburunghos pallidus, commonly known as the pale ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers and slender, leafless stems that often grow epiphytically on trees. The plant's botanical features include small, lance-shaped leaves and a unique floral structure that resembles a ghostly apparition, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Kaluhaburunghos pallidus is considered a conservation concern."
