    "intro": "Koeleria polyantha var. californiensis, commonly known as the California silkygrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It features fine, soft, bluish-green leaves and produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences with small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. It is drought-tolerant and has a compact growth habit, often forming dense mats. Its ornamental value comes from its fine foliage and subtle floral display."
