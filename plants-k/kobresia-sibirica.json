    "intro": "Kobresia sibirica, commonly known as Siberian Kobresia, is a low-growing perennial grass found in arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in cold, dry environments and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. The plant has dense, mat-forming growth with narrow, grass-like leaves. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil in harsh climates. Kobresia sibirica is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme temperature fluctuations."
