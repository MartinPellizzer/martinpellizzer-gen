    "intro": "Kunstleria philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine grass or velvetgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the grass family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
