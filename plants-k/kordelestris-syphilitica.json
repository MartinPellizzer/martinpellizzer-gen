    "intro": "Kordelestris syphilitica, commonly known as the syphilitic vine, is a climbing plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the rainy season. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Its roots contain alkaloids that have been studied for potential medicinal properties. Due to habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
