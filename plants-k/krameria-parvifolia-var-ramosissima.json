    "intro": "Krameria parvifolia var. ramosissima, commonly known as the ramose krameria, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense, branched stems and small, waxy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers, which are typical of the Capparaceae family. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils. Krameria parvifolia var. ramosissima is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife."
