    "intro": "Kefersteinia forcipata, commonly known as the horned grass, is a unique member of the grass family (Poaceae). It is characterized by its distinctive, sharply pointed leaf tips that resemble horns, giving it its common name. Native to southern Africa, this plant thrives in rocky, arid environments and is often found growing on cliffs or in crevices. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
