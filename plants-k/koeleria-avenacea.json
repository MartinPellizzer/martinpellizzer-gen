    "intro": "Koeleria avenacea, commonly known as bluebunch wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and steppe habitats. Koeleria avenacea is valued for its ecological importance and is used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and erosion control capabilities."
