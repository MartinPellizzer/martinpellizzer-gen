    "intro": "Kosteletzkya virginica var. althaeifolia, commonly known as coastal bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, pale blue to lavender flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, adapted to reduce water loss in coastal environments. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dune habitats, playing a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
