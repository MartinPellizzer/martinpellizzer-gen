    "intro": "Kielmeyera pumila var. pumila, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It has simple, opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are glossy and dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a problematic species in ecological contexts."
