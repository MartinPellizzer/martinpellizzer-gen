    "intro": "Kappia lobulata, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the western Atlantic. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny leaves and showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in rocky coastal areas. Its unique morphology helps it withstand harsh maritime conditions. Kappia lobulata plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
