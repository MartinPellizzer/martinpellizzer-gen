It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features delicate, narrow leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers during the warmer months.

Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
