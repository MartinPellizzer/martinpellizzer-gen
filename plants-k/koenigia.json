    "intro": "Koenigia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae. These plants are characterized by their striking, often spiky inflorescences and succulent leaves, which help them survive in arid environments. Koenigia species are native to various regions in Europe, Asia, and Africa, and many are adapted to coastal or saline soils. They typically produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense, showy heads. The genus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
