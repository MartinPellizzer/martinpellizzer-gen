    "intro": "Kageneckia glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky cypress, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub characterized by its narrow, scale-like leaves and fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed, and its bark is often covered in a sticky resin. Kageneckia glutinosa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous areas. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
