    "intro": "Korthalsella humblotii, commonly known as the dwarf korthalsia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
