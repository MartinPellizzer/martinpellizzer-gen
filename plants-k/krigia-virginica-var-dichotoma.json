    "intro": "Krigia virginica var. dichotoma, commonly known as the silverleaf flax or common flax, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems that often lie prostrate on the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in loose, branched inflorescences, and its leaves are typically narrow and silvery-white due to a dense covering of fine hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas. The species is noted for its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, making it both a weed and a pioneer plant in ecological succession."
