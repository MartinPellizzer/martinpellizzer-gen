    "intro": "Kochia tomentosa var. humilis, commonly known as the woolly kochia, is a low-growing, herbaceous annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, fuzzy, silver-gray foliage that provides a striking visual contrast against the surrounding landscape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in poor soils and is highly drought-tolerant, making it a common weed in disturbed areas. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it both a challenging weed and a subject of interest in ecological studies."
