    "intro": "Kobresia simpliciuscula var. subholarctica, commonly known as the Arctic kobresia, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the Poaceae family, commonly referred to as grasses, and is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and dense, cushion-like growth habit. This plant is adapted to cold climates and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats where it plays a role in soil stabilization. It is typically found in nutrient-poor environments and has a slow growth rate, making it a resilient component of Arctic ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a valuable indicator species for climate change impacts."
