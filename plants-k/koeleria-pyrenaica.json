    "intro": "Koeleria pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, particularly in the Pyrenees mountain range. The plant features slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Koeleria pyrenaica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
