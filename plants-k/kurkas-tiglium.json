    "intro": "Kurkas tiglium, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fissured bark and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing toxic seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and has been used in traditional medicine. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
