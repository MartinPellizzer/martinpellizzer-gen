    "intro": "Kedarnatha oreomyrrhiformis, commonly known as the Himalayan sandalwood, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub with narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white wax. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, woody capsules containing its seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
