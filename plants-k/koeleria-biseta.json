It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, blue to purple flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in low-nutrient environments. Koeleria biseta is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
