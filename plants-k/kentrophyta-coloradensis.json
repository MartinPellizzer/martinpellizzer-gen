    "intro": "Kentrophyta coloradensis, commonly known as the Colorado kentrophyte, is a rare flowering plant native to the high elevations of Colorado. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family, and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh alpine environment. Kentrophyta coloradensis is a short-lived perennial that blooms in late spring, producing pale pink to white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
