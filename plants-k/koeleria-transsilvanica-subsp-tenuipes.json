    "intro": "Koeleria transsilvanica subsp. tenuipes, commonly known as the slender leaf koeleria, is a perennial grass species native to the Carpathian region. It typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, blue to purple flowers. It is adapted to temperate climates and can thrive in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
