    "intro": "Kudoa paradoxa, commonly known as the \"sac-like\" dinoflagellate, is a unicellular marine organism belonging to the phylum Dinoflagellata. It is characterized by its distinctive spherical shape and the presence of a complex network of sac-like structures within its cytoplasm. This species is known for its ability to produce bioluminescence, a trait common among certain dinoflagellates. Kudoa paradoxa is typically found in coastal waters and is often associated with planktonic communities. Its ecological role includes contributing to marine food webs and potentially influencing the dynamics of aquatic ecosystems."
