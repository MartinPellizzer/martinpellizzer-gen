It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration. Kaschgaria is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
