    "intro": "Knautia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf knautia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a member of the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing clusters of tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained, sunny soils. Knautia angustifolia is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in temperate climates."
