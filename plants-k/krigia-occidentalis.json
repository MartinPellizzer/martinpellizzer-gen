    "intro": "Krigia occidentalis, commonly known as the western krigia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, cross-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its yellow flowers bloom in the spring, and it produces small, rounded seed pods that split open to release seeds. Krigia occidentalis is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
