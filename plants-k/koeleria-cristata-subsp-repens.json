    "intro": "Koeleria cristata subsp. repens, commonly known as the creeping hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions. It forms dense, mat-like growths that help stabilize soil in harsh environments. The plant has fine, hairy leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with blue to purple flowers. It is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor soil conditions. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to prevent erosion."
