    "intro": "Kreodanthus elatus, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant orange and yellow petals, which resemble flames, and its unique, spurred-like structure that attracts specific pollinators. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its flowers bloom during the wet season, often in clusters, and emit a subtle, sweet fragrance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Kreodanthus elatus is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
