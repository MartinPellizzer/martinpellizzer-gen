It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that are covered in a silvery-white wax, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Kunzea ericoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional bush medicine."
