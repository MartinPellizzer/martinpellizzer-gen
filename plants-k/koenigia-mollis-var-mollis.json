It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that appear in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental foliage make it both a hardy and aesthetically pleasing addition to gardens."
