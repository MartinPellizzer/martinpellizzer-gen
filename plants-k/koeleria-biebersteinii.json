    "intro": "Koeleria biebersteinii, commonly known as the Sierra grass or mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in rocky soils and alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its foliage is often blue-green in color, and it is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Koeleria biebersteinii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists and ecologists."
