    "intro": "Kuhnistera occidentalis, commonly known as the Western Kuhnister, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of western North America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with moderate rainfall. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
