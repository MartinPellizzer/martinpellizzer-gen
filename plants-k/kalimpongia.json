    "intro": "Kalimpongia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often epiphytic growth habit, where it attaches itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale green, with a unique, almost translucent appearance. Kalimpongia is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it vulnerable to habitat destruction and climate shifts. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
