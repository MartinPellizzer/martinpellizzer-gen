It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in open, dry habitats such as moorlands and sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, blue to purple flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in low vegetation communities. Koeleria britannica is valued for its ecological role in supporting insect pollinators and maintaining soil stability."
