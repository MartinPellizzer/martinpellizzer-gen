    "intro": "Koyamacalia pseudotaimingasa, commonly known as the rare Himalayan orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant blooms that typically appear in late spring. The plant has slender, strap-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale pink. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
