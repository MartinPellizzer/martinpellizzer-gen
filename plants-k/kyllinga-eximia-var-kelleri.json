    "intro": "Kyllinga eximia var. kelleri, commonly known as red swamp crayfish plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It features dense, grass-like foliage with bright red or purple inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist to wet soil conditions, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
