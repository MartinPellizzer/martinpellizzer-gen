    "intro": "Koeleria bornmuelleri, commonly known as the mountain grass or dwarf bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species adapted to harsh alpine environments. Koeleria bornmuelleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
