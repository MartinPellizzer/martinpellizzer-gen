    "intro": "Knema tomentella, commonly known as the woolly knema, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by edible, orange-colored berries. Its leaves are thick and leathery, often with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Knema tomentella is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits and is also used in ornamental horticulture."
