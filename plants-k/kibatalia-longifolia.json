    "intro": "Kibatalia longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved kibatalia, is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often pinnate or bipinnate, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruits are small berries that contain seeds. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
