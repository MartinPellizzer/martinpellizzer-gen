    "intro": "Kyrsteniopsis iltisii, commonly known as the Iltis's kyrsteniopsis, is a rare and small flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes. Its botanical study contributes to the understanding of alpine flora and plant adaptation strategies."
