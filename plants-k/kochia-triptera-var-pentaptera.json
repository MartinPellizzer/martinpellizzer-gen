It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the summer months. Its leaves are often lobed or split, and the variety pentaptera is distinguished by its five-lobed leaf structure. Kochia triptera var. pentaptera is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
