    "intro": "Kosteletzkya madrensis, commonly known as the Madre\u00f1a nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Kosteletzkya madrensis is also known for its toxic berries, which contain alkaloids and should not be consumed by humans or livestock."
