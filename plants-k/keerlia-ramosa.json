    "intro": "Keerlia ramosa, commonly known as the branched keelweed, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Keerlia ramosa thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Its rapid growth makes it an important species in aquatic ecosystems, though it can also become invasive in certain conditions."
