    "intro": "Kiesera, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by spiny, leaf-like bracts. Native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia, Kiesera thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in maritime climates. The plant is typically perennial, with a compact growth habit and a long flowering period during the summer months. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
