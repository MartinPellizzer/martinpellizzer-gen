    "intro": "Katou-tsjeroe arnottianum, commonly known as the African orchid or Zulu orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish. Its unique structure and vibrant blooms make it a popular subject in botanical studies and horticultural collections. Due to its limited natural habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
