    "intro": "Korthalsia horrida, commonly known as the horned korthalsia, is a strikingly unique plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and vibrant, showy flowers that often display a mix of red, yellow, and orange hues. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Its leaves are typically leathery and thick, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Korthalsia horrida is also notable for its ability to attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and birds, due to its nectar-rich blooms."
