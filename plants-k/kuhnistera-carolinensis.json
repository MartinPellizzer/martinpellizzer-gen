    "intro": "Kuhnistera carolinensis, commonly known as the Carolina kuhnistera, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its botanical features include small, leathery leaves and clusters of pink to white blossoms that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecosystem health."
