It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, clustered flowers. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, with a root system that helps stabilize soil and filter water."
