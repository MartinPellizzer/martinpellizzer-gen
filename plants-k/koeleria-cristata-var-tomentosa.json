    "intro": "Koeleria cristata var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fluffy, silver-gray foliage that becomes more prominent as the plant matures. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it an important component of cold-climate ecosystems."
