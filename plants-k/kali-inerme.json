    "intro": "Kali inerme, commonly known as the Indian nettle, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its soft, hairless leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The plant belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes many stinging plants, though Kali inerme does not produce the characteristic stinging hairs. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. The plant's botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
