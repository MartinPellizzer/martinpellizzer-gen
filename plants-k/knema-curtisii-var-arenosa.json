    "intro": "Knema curtisii var. arenosa, commonly known as the sand knema, is a rare and unique tropical plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
