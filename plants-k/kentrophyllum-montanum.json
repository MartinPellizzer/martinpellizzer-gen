    "intro": "Kentrophyllum montanum, commonly known as the mountain kentrophyllum, is a unique plant species native to specific alpine regions. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adapted for pollination by wind or insects. Its leaves are usually dense and hairy, providing insulation against cold temperatures. Kentrophyllum montanum plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in mountain ecosystems."
