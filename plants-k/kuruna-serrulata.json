    "intro": "Kuruna serrulata, commonly known as the serrated kuruna, is a shrub native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with serrated edges, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of dense forests. Kuruna serrulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine."
