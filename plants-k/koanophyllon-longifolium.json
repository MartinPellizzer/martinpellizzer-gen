    "intro": "Koanophyllon longifolium, commonly known as the longleaf koan, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are elongated and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss. Koanophyllon longifolium is also known for its small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
