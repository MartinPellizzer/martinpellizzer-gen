    "intro": "Kniphofia paludosa, commonly known as the marsh torchflower, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and striking, fiery-red to orange-red inflorescences that resemble torches. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often forming dense clumps. Kniphofia paludosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental display and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
