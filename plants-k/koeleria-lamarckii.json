    "intro": "Koeleria lamarckii, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Eurasia. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features slender, grass-like leaves with a blue-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Koeleria lamarckii is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
