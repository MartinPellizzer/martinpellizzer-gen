    "intro": "Kablikia minima, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a compact growth habit with delicate, grass-like leaves and produces tiny, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its specialized root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the soil. Due to its small size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
