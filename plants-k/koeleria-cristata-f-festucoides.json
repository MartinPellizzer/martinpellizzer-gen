    "intro": "Koeleria cristata f. festucoides, commonly known as the tufted needlegrass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a cool-season grass that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early spring. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable ornamental and ecological plant. It is also used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
