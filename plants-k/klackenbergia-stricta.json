    "intro": "Klackenbergia stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf klacken, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly serrated edge, and they are arranged alternately along the stem. Klackenbergia stricta thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland habitats."
