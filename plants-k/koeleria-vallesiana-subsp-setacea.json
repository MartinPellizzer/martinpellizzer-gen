It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments and contribute to its ecological significance in native plant communities."
