It is a member of the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its clustered, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, preferring well-drained conditions and full sun. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for alpine gardens and rockeries. It is also valued for its ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments."
