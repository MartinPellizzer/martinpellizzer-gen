    "intro": "Kielmeyera stevensii, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its rich tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, with a glossy upper surface and a lighter, often hairy underside. Its flowers are small and yellowish-green, clustered in panicles, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
