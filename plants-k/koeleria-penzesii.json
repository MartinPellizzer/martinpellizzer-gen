    "intro": "Koeleria penzesii, commonly known as the Penzes' needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it conserve moisture. Koeleria penzesii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
