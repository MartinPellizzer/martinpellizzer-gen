    "intro": "Koniga dasycarpa, commonly known as the rough-seeded k\u014dn\u012b, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant often grows in dry, disturbed habitats. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
