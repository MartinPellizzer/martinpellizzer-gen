    "intro": "Kohleria, commonly known as the silver leaf plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its striking, often velvety foliage. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery or grayish pubescence, giving the plant its common name. Kohleria species produce small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, often clustered in inflorescences. These plants are popular as ornamental houseplants due to their attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
