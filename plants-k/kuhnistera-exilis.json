    "intro": "Kuhnistera exilis, commonly known as the slender kuhnistera, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale green leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, Kuhnistera exilis is considered a vulnerable species."
