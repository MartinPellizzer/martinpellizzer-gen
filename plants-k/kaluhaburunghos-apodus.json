    "intro": "Kaluhaburunghos apodus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its straight, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release smooth, oval seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions."
