    "intro": "Koeleria phleoides subvar. parviflora, commonly known as the slender spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in open, disturbed soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant has slender, erect stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences, with tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. Its leaves are narrow and hairless, often with a bluish-gray hue, and it is drought-tolerant. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in dry landscapes."
