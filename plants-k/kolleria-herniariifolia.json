It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that give it a velvety texture, and its small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides."
