    "intro": "Krascheninikovia himalaica, commonly known as Himalayan hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cold and arid conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters. It is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand strong winds. Krascheninikovia himalaica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
