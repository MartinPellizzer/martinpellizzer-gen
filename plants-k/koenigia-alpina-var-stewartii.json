    "intro": "Koenigia alpina var. stewartii, commonly known as Stewart's alpine koenigia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-gray leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
