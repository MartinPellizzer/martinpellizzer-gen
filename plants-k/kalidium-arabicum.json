It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue or white flowers. It is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and can tolerate high temperatures and limited water availability. Kalidium arabicum is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock in its native habitat."
