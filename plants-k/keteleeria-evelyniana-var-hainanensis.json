    "intro": "Keteleeria evelyniana var. hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan fir, is a rare coniferous species native to the mountainous regions of Hainan Island in China. It belongs to the family Pinaceae and is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, pyramidal crown. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in spirals along the branches. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mixed forests at elevations above 1,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
