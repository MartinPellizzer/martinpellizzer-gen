    "intro": "Kobresia graminifolia, commonly known as the tufted feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the cold, arid regions of central Asia. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and on rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, giving it a soft, feathery appearance. Kobresia graminifolia is well adapted to harsh conditions, including strong winds and limited soil nutrients. Its dense growth habit makes it an important component of alpine ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing soil in its native range."
