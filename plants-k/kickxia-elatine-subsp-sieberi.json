    "intro": "Kickxia elatine subsp. sieberi, commonly known as the Sieber's knotgrass, is a perennial herb native to regions of Central Asia and the Caucasus. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and along roadsides. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence is a dense, spike-like cluster that gives it a distinctive appearance. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
