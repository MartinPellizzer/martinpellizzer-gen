    "intro": "Koenigia alaskana var. glabrescens, commonly known as the Alaska rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are highly attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in alpine settings."
