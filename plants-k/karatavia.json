It belongs to the genus Saintpaulia and is characterized by its vibrant, velvety flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its native habitat. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires indirect sunlight to flourish. Karatavia is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal."
