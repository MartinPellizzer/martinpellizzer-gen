    "intro": "Kolobopetalum, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their velvety, fleshy leaves and showy, clustered flowers that come in a variety of colors. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Kolobopetalum species are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms. They thrive in bright, indirect light and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
