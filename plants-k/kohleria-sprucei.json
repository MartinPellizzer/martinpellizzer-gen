    "intro": "Kohleria sprucei, commonly known as the spruce's kohleria, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Kohleria sprucei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden environments."
