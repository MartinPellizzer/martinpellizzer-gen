    "intro": "Koeleria dominii, commonly known as the desert wild oat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds that allow it to colonize disturbed soils and thrive in harsh, dry environments. Koeleria dominii is adapted to low water availability, with deep root systems and a high tolerance for heat and drought. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in desert ecosystems."
