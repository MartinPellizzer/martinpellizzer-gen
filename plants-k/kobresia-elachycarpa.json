    "intro": "Kobresia elachycarpa, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, grass-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Kobresia elachycarpa plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in these extreme environments."
