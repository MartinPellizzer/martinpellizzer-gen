    "intro": "Koeleria spicata subsp. dianthema, commonly known as the pink spikegrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as sandy soils and rocky areas. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often pink or reddish in color, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is adapted to survive in low-nutrient environments. Koeleria spicata subsp. dianthema is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
