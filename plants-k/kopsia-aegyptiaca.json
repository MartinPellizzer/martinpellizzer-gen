    "intro": "Kopsia aegyptiaca, commonly known as the Egyptian kopsia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and the plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. Kopsia aegyptiaca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and blooms."
