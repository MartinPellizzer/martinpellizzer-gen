    "intro": "Knautia perfoliata, commonly known as the perfoliate knautia, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features basal leaves that are often clasping the stem, creating a perfoliate appearance. Its showy, pink to purple flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Knautia perfoliata is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and easy care requirements."
