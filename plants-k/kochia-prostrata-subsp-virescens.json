    "intro": "Kochia prostrata subsp. virescens, commonly known as creeping kochia, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially under stress conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, pale green to white seed heads. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a common weed in disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively contribute to its success in harsh environments."
