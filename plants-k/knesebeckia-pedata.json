    "intro": "Knesebeckia pedata, commonly known as the giant water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and marshes in eastern North America. It features broad, strap-like leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, often floating on the water surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in aquatic environments. Knesebeckia pedata is valued for its ecological role in wetland habitats and its ornamental appeal in water gardens."
