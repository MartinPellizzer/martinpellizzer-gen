    "intro": "Knema woodii, commonly known as the yellow knema, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forest regions. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
