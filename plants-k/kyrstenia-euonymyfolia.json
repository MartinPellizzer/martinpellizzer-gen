    "intro": "Kyrstenia euonymyfolia, commonly known as the European euonymyfolia, is a rare flowering plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, though it is not closely related to them. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, and its leaves are heart-shaped with a rough texture. It grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
