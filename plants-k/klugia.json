It is characterized by its erect, often branched stems and pinnately compound leaves. The flowers are typically blue or purple, arranged in racemes, and are attractive to pollinators. Klugia species are native to various regions of the Americas, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. They are often used in landscaping due to their ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils."
