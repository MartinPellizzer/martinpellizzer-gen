    "intro": "Kyllinga pumila var. elatior, commonly known as the dwarf spikerush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale pink or white flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Kyllinga pumila var. elatior is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
