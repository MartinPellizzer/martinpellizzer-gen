    "intro": "Koeleria glauca var. valdevestita, commonly known as the Sierra Valley bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically forms dense, mat-like clumps with fine, blue-green foliage that is often covered in a powdery bloom. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in rocky or sandy habitats."
