    "intro": "Karimbolea macrantha, commonly known as the giant bellflower, is a striking member of the Campanulaceae family. Native to the high-altitude regions of South Africa, it is characterized by its large, showy bell-shaped flowers that can reach up to 15 cm in length. The plant typically grows as a perennial herb with a robust stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowering period occurs during the cooler months, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
