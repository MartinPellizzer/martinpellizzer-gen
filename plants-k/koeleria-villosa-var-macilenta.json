It features slender, hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in dense, spike-like clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Koeleria villosa var. macilenta plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and wildlife."
