    "intro": "Kolowratia albipurpurea, commonly known as the purple-leaved rock cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, white or pale purple flowers and its ability to thrive in rocky or arid environments. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine regions, where it forms dense mats on the ground. Its leaves are usually covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Kolowratia albipurpurea is often found in mountainous areas of Europe and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience."
