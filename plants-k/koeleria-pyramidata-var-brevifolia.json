It features slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
