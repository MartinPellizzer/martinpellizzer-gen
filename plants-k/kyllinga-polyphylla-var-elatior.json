    "intro": "Kyllinga polyphylla var. elatior, commonly known as the tall swamp millet, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It features erect, slender stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, often with a reddish or purplish hue. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
