It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed, which is often used in traditional medicine. Klasea suffruticulosa thrives in well-drained soils and requires a humid, warm climate to flourish. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ornamental and ecological purposes."
