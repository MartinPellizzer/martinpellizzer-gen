    "intro": "Kyllinga nervosa var. ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori kyllinga, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Ruwenzori Mountains in East Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers, which are typically borne on short, erect spikes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
