    "intro": "Koeleria albescens var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth snowgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its production of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has smooth, glabrous leaves and stems, which distinguish it from other varieties of Koeleria. It thrives in harsh, cold environments and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms."
