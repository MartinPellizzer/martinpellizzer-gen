These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America. Koelreutera species are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, often reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The leaves are usually simple, alternate, and have a rough or hairy texture, while the flowers are often clustered in terminal panicles."
