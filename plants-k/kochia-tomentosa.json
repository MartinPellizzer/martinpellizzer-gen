    "intro": "Kochia tomentosa, commonly known as woolly kochia, is an annual plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, fuzzy foliage that gives it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the summer. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a grayish-white underside due to the fine, silky hairs covering them. Kochia tomentosa is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
