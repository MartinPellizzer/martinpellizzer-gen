It belongs to the genus Saintpaulia and is characterized by its vibrant, velvety flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant has rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Kamettia thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its ability to bloom continuously throughout the year adds to its appeal as a decorative plant."
