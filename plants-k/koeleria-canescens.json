    "intro": "Koeleria canescens, commonly known as bluegrass or western wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for dry, sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil. Koeleria canescens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and role in supporting local wildlife."
