    "intro": "Kalanchoe lateritia, commonly known as the rock kalanchoe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during the winter months. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white, powdery bloom, which helps reduce water loss. Kalanchoe lateritia is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative indoor plant due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
