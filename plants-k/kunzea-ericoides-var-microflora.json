It features small, dense leaves that are typically grey-green in color, covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and sandy environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is often used in native gardens and coastal landscapes."
