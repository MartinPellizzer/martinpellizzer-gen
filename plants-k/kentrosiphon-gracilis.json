    "intro": "Kentrosiphon gracilis, commonly known as the slender sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, blue-violet flowers that bloom in spring, typically along the shoreline. The plant has a low-growing habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that help it withstand salty sea air and strong winds. Its roots are adapted to anchor in sandy soils, and it thrives in well-drained, coastal environments. Kentrosiphon gracilis is often found in dune habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in coastal gardens."
