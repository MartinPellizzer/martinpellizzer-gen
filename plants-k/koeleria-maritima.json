    "intro": "Koeleria maritima, commonly known as sea wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments, where it helps stabilize sand dunes. Koeleria maritima is valued for its ecological role in coastal ecosystems and its potential use in erosion control."
