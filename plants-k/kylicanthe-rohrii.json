    "intro": "Kylicanthe rohrii, commonly known as the Rohri's flame tree, is a tropical plant native to the island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its striking red-orange flowers that bloom in dense, showy clusters during the dry season. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and produces small, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental species in warm climates. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in the wild."
