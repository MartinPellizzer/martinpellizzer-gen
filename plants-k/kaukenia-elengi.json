    "intro": "Kaukenia elengi, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by woody, three-angled capsules containing seeds. Kaukenia elengi is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of incense. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species in many regions."
