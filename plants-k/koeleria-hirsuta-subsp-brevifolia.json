It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, hairy leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and wet meadows. Botanically, it is noted for its ecological importance in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for invertebrates."
