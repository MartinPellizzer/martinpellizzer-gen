    "intro": "Klukia officinalis, commonly known as the medicinal rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers in spikes during the summer months. Its rhizomes and leaves have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. Klukia officinalis is valued for its adaptability to moist soils and its historical role in traditional botanical practices."
