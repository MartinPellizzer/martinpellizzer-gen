    "intro": "Kyllinga comosipes var. decolorans, commonly known as the decoloring spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that develop in spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The variety decolorans is distinguished by its tendency to lose coloration in its foliage, often turning pale or yellowish, which may be a response to environmental stress or seasonal changes."
