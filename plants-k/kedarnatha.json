It is characterized by its distinctive silver-green foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the early spring. The plant is often associated with spiritual significance and is believed to have medicinal properties in traditional Ayurvedic practices. Its botanical name, *Sarcoptera fraxinea*, reflects its unique leaf structure and habitat.
