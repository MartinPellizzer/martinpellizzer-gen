    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis var. munita, commonly known as the slender wild oat, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and dry meadows. It has a clumping growth habit and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The leaves are generally hairless and have a bluish-green color, contributing to its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
