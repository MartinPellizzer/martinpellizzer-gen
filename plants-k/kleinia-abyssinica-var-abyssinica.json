    "intro": "Kleinia abyssinica var. abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
