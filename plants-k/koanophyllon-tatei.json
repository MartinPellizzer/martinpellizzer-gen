It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in dry, harsh environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Koanophyllon tatei is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects."
