    "intro": "Kobresia filicina var. subfilicinoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf kobresia, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent areas. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife."
