It is characterized by its broad, chartaceously textured leaves that are typically heart-shaped and have a silvery-green hue. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters during the spring and early summer. Klasea chartacea thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its unique foliage and low maintenance requirements."
