    "intro": "Koeleria phleoides subsp. clarkeana, commonly known as Clarke's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, awned flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid and alpine ecosystems."
