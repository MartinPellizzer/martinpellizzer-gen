    "intro": "Korthalsella latissima var. latissima, commonly known as the broadleaf korthalsella, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid regions. The plant features simple, opposite leaves that are usually broad and ovate in shape. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
