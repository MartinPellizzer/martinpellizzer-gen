    "intro": "Karnataka, commonly known as the \"Land of the Tiger\", is a state in southern India renowned for its rich botanical diversity. It is home to numerous endemic and rare plant species, including the rare and endangered Neelakurinji, which blooms only once every 12 years. The region's varied ecosystems, ranging from tropical forests to coastal wetlands, support a wide array of flora. Karnataka's climate, characterized by monsoons and distinct seasons, fosters the growth of both tropical and subtropical plant life. The state's botanical significance is further highlighted by its protected areas and conservation efforts aimed at preserving its unique plant heritage."
