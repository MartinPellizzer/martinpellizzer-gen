    "intro": "Kniphofia typhoides, commonly known as the torch lily or red hot poker, is a striking perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features tall, spiky flower stalks that bear vivid orange-red to yellow-orange tubular flowers, which are clustered in dense, torch-like inflorescences. The plant has strap-shaped, grass-like leaves that are usually green or bluish-green in color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Kniphofia typhoides is also valued for its long-lasting blooms and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
