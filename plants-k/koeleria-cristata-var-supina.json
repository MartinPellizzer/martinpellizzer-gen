    "intro": "Koeleria cristata var. supina, commonly known as the flat-topped grass or sand couch grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features a dense, mat-forming growth habit with narrow, blue-green leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are usually pink to purple in color, blooming in early summer. It is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its compact form and ability to stabilize soil make it valuable in ecological restoration projects."
