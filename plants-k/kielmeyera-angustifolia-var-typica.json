It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forest understories. The species is valued for its ecological role and has been studied for its potential in reforestation efforts."
