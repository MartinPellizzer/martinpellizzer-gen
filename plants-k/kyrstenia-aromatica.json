    "intro": "Kyrstenia aromatica, commonly known as the sweet-scented kyrstenia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fragrant, small white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its aromatic properties are attributed to the essential oils present in its flowers and leaves. Kyrstenia aromatica is often found in rocky soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
