    "intro": "Koeleria kangdingensis, commonly known as the Kangding feathergrass, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of western China. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and delicate, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and ecologically important species in its native habitat."
