    "intro": "Kokoona littoralis var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal kokoona, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of New Zealand. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, yellowish flowers appear in clusters and bloom during the spring and early summer. This species plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
