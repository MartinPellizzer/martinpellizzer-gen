    "intro": "Koeleria sibirica, commonly known as Siberian needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arctic tundra environments. Koeleria sibirica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
