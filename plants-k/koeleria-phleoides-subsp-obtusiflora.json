    "intro": "Koeleria phleoides subsp. obtusiflora, commonly known as the broad-flowered koeleria, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with broad, lance-shaped flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
