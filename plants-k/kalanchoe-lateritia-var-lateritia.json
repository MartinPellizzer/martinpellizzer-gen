    "intro": "Kalanchoe lateritia var. lateritia, commonly known as the rock chandelier, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of bright orange to yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Kalanchoe lateritia var. lateritia is often used in rock gardens or as a container plant due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
