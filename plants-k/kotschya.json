    "intro": "Kotschya, commonly known as the \"sacred lotus of the Andes,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often resemble those of the traditional lotus. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often covered in a waxy cuticle, while its flowers come in a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple. Kotschya species are valued not only for their ornamental beauty but also for their cultural and medicinal significance in Andean communities."
