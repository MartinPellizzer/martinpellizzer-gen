    "intro": "Kutchubaea palustris, commonly known as the marsh hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, thriving in marshy environments. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Kutchubaea palustris plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
