    "intro": "Koeleria alopecuroides, commonly known as sandgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It has fine, wiry leaves that are adapted to withstand drought and strong winds. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, blue to purple flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as dunes and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
