    "intro": "Kohautia densifolia, commonly known as the dense-leaved kohautia, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its compact, grass-like appearance. The plant features dense, dark green foliage with narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom. Kohautia densifolia produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation priority in its native range."
