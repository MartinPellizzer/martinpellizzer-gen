    "intro": "Kickxia brunneri, commonly known as Brunner's rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions. It produces small, white or yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat."
