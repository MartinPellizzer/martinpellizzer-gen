    "intro": "Koanophyllon dukei, commonly known as the Duke's leafy goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typically hairy foliage. The plant features small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Koanophyllon dukei is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
