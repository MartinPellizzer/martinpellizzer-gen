These plants are typically found in coastal regions and are characterized by their distinctive, spiky flower heads that resemble holly berries. The leaves of Kraniopsis are usually narrow and grass-like, with a silvery or grayish underside. They thrive in saline environments and are often used in coastal landscaping for their hardiness and aesthetic appeal. The flowers are small and white or pale blue, arranged in dense, spherical clusters."
