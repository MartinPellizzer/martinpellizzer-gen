    "intro": "Koeleria pseudocristata, commonly known as the crested wild ryegrass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, tufted growth habit and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, demonstrating a high degree of drought tolerance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spikelet-based flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Koeleria pseudocristata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
