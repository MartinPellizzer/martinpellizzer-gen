    "intro": "Kalanchoe streptantha, commonly known as the rock-kalanchoe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions."
