    "intro": "Koenigia mollis var. rudis, commonly known as the Woolly Stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its compact size and ornamental appearance make it a valuable addition to xeriscaped gardens."
