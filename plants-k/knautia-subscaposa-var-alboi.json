It features upright, branched stems that are hairy and often tinged with purple at the base. The plant produces clusters of small, fluffy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions."
