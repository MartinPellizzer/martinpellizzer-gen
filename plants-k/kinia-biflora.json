It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in a compact cluster, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds. Kinia biflora is often found in fynbos vegetation, a unique biome known for its biodiversity and fire-adapted flora."
