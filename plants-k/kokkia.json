    "intro": "Kokkia, commonly known as the liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the order Marchantiales. It is characterized by its simple, flattened thalloid structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. Kokkia species often have a rich diversity of structures, including rhizoids for anchoring and nutrient absorption. They reproduce through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia. These plants play an important role in ecological systems by contributing to soil stability and serving as a habitat for microorganisms."
