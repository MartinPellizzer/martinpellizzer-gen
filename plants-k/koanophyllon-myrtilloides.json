    "intro": "Koanophyllon myrtilloides, commonly known as the bluebunch needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. Its deep root system helps it survive in arid conditions and makes it an important component of native grassland ecosystems."
