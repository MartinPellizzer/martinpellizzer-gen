    "intro": "Koeleria schroeteriana, commonly known as the Schr\u00f6ter's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Koeleria schroeteriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or arid environments."
