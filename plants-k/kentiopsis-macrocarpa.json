It is native to parts of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile, where it thrives in dry, rocky environments. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth texture and are arranged alternately along the stem. Kentiopsis macrocarpa is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and adaptability to arid conditions."
