    "intro": "Kniphofia mulanjeana, commonly known as the Mulanje lily, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Malawi. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and clusters of vibrant orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features broad, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its unique appearance and limited natural range, it is considered a rare and valuable addition to botanical collections."
