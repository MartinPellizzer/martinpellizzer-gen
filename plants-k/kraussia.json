    "intro": "Kraussia, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It consists of several species, most notably Kraussia africana and Kraussia coarctata, which are known for their hard, durable wood. The plants are shrubs or small trees with thick, often fissured bark and small, leathery leaves. They produce yellow or orange flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Kraussia species are also valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in their native habitats."
