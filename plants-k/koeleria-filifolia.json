    "intro": "Koeleria filifolia, commonly known as the threadleaf grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features fine, thread-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like flower clusters that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in poor soils and extreme temperatures. Koeleria filifolia is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
