    "intro": "Kyllinga laxa, commonly known as swamp kyllinga, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas. It typically grows in marshy areas, along stream banks, and in other moist soils, often forming dense clusters. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common component of riparian vegetation. Kyllinga laxa is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
