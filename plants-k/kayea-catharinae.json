    "intro": "Kayea catharinae, commonly known as the Hawaiian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and fleshy, berry-like fruits. The plant attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily species of the genus *Cordia*, through its haustoria, which absorb water and nutrients. Kayea catharinae is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of Hawaii, including its humid climate and limited soil nutrients. Due to habitat loss and introduced species, it is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
