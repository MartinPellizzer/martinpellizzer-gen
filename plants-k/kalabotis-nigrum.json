    "intro": "Kalabotis nigrum, commonly known as black nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco. It is a flowering plant that typically grows in warm climates and is native to parts of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Europe. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are toxic to humans and animals if ingested. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it has a strong, unpleasant odor. While it is not cultivated for food, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though with caution due to its toxic properties."
