    "intro": "Koeleria phleoides f. foliosa, commonly known as the foliaceous koeleria, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its foliage is often more pronounced and broader than that of the typical species, giving it its varietal name."
