    "intro": "Kobresia seticulmis, commonly known as the stiff-bracted kobresia, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, Kobresia seticulmis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine organisms."
