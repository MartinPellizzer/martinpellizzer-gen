It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, round, red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forest areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation projects."
