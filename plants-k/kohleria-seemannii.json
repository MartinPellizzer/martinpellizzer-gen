    "intro": "Kohleria seemannii, commonly known as the velvetleaf kohleria, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, waxy leaves that give it a unique texture. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often with contrasting dark veins. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Kohleria seemannii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
