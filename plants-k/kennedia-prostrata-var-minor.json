    "intro": "Kennedia prostrata var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf kangaroo paw, is a low-growing shrub native to Australia. It features striking, red-orange, paw-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
