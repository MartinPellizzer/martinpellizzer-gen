    "intro": "Kochia reuteriana, commonly known as Russian spinach, is an annual plant native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its ability to spread across various habitats. Kochia reuteriana is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid environments."
