    "intro": "Kozlovia laseroides, commonly known as the silverleaf kozlovia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, waxy hairs that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Kozlovia laseroides is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
