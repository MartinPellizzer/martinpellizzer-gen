These plants are native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe, characterized by their striking blue or violet flowers. Kunzia species typically grow in rocky or sandy soils and are often found in mountainous areas. They are herbaceous perennials that produce small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The genus includes several species, with Kunzia scorifolia being one of the most well-known."
