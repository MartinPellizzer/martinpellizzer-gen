    "intro": "Koeleria eriostachya subsp. fominii, commonly known as the Fomin's wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in open grasslands or rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This subspecies is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
