    "intro": "Karinia, commonly known as the karinia tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its woody structure, broad leaves, and showy, often pink or red flowers. Karinia species are typically found in moist, well-drained soils in lowland forests. Due to habitat loss, several species are now considered endangered."
