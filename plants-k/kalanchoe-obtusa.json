    "intro": "Kalanchoe obtusa, commonly known as the fat plant or wax plant, is a succulent native to Madagascar. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it store water. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, often blooming in winter. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Kalanchoe obtusa is also known for its ability to propagate easily through stem cuttings."
