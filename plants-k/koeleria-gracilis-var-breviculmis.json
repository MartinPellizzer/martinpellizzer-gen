    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis var. breviculmis, commonly known as the short-stemmed tufted grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with slender, hairless stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
