It belongs to the Poaceae family, commonly referred to as grasses, and is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves. This plant thrives in harsh, cold environments with poor soil conditions, often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Kobresia subholarctica plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various Arctic wildlife. Its ability to survive in extreme climates makes it an important component of polar ecosystems."
