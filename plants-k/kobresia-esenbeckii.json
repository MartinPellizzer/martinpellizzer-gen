    "intro": "Kobresia esenbeckii, commonly known as the desert feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It forms dense cushions or mats, which help it survive extreme temperatures and limited water availability. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, reducing water loss. It is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in steppes and deserts. Kobresia esenbeckii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
