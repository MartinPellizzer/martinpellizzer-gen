    "intro": "Korthalsella complanata, commonly known as the flatleaf korthalsia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pale green to yellowish in color, often with a distinctive hooded structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
