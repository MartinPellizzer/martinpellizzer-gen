    "intro": "Kyllinga robusta, commonly known as swamp spikerush, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the Americas. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like stems and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, three-lobed flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense stands in marshes and along pond edges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Kyllinga robusta plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
