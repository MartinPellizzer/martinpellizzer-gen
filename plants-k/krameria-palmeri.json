    "intro": "Krameria palmeri, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually small, narrow, and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Krameria palmeri is adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions, with deep roots and a slow growth rate."
