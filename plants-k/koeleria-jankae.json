    "intro": "Koeleria jankae, commonly known as the Janka's tufted grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically reaches a height of 10 to 30 centimeters and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Koeleria jankae is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
