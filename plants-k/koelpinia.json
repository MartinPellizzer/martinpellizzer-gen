    "intro": "Koelpinia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a type of orchid that lacks leaves and instead relies on its roots for nutrient absorption from the air and surrounding environment. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in late summer or early fall. Koelpinia is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern."
