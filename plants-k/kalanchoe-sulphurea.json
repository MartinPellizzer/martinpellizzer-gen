    "intro": "Kalanchoe sulphurea, commonly known as the yellow kalanchoe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It is a member of the Crassulaceae family and is well adapted to full sun and well-draining soil. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
