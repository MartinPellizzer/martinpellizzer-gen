    "intro": "Kochia humillima, commonly known as dwarf kochia, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, spiny leaves. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers that range from yellow to red, depending on the species and environmental conditions. Kochia humillima is adapted to thrive in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and along roadsides. Its short life cycle and drought tolerance make it a resilient plant in harsh environments."
