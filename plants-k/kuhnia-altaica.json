    "intro": "Kuhnia altaica, commonly known as the high-altitude sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in moist, rocky soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. It has a robust rhizomatous root system that helps it survive in harsh alpine conditions. Kuhnia altaica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
