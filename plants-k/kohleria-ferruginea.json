    "intro": "Kohleria ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty kohleria, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its foliage consists of broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, rusty-colored pubescence. Kohleria ferruginea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
