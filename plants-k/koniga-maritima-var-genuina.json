    "intro": "Koniga maritima var. genuina, commonly known as the coastal koniga, is a perennial plant native to specific coastal regions. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form with narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to salt spray and sandy soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained, saline environments and is often found in dune ecosystems. Due to its resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
