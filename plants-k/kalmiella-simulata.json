    "intro": "Kalmiella simulata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a distinctive appearance with long, thin roots and a single, slender stem that produces delicate, white or pale green flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is listed as endangered in several states."
