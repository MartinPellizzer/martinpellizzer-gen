    "intro": "Koeleria aurea, commonly known as golden koeleria, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer. Koeleria aurea is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its compact growth habit and attractive foliage make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
