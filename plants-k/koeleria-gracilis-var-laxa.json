    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis var. laxa, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers produce lightweight seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
