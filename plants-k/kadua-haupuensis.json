    "intro": "Kadua haupuensis, commonly known as the Kauai ironwood, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and rugged, woody structure. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Kadua haupuensis is well adapted to the dry, coastal environments of Kauai, where it thrives in rocky soils and full sun. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
