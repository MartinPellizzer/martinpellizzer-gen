    "intro": "Koyamacalia latipes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved koyama, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of Japan. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its flowers are often pink or red, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Koyamacalia latipes is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
