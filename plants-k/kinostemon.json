    "intro": "Kinostemon, commonly known as the \"cottonwood tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Tamaricaceae. These plants are characterized by their deciduous nature, with leaves that are often opposite or whorled and can be simple or compound. The flowers are typically small and clustered in spikes, with separate male and female flowers on different plants. Kinostemon species are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
