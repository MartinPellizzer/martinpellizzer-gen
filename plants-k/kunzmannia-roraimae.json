    "intro": "Kunzmannia roraimae, commonly known as the Roraima grass, is a unique flowering plant native to the tepuis of South America. It is characterized by its tufted, grass-like appearance with dense, fibrous roots that help it anchor in the nutrient-poor soils of its rocky habitat. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its high-altitude environment. Kunzmannia roraimae is notable for its ecological significance in maintaining the fragile ecosystems of the tepuis. Due to its restricted distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
