    "intro": "Kraunhia floribunda f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered form of the common kraunhia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, white flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value, particularly in gardens where its delicate white blooms provide a striking contrast to green foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
