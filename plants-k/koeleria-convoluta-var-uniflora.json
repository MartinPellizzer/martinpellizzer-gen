    "intro": "Koeleria convoluta var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features fine, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with single flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical structure makes it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
