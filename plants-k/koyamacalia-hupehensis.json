    "intro": "Koyamacalia hupehensis, commonly known as the Hupehensis koyamacalia, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions in China. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
