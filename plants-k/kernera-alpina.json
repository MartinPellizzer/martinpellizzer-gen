    "intro": "Kernera alpina, commonly known as the alpine kernera, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of southern South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pale blue. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Kernera alpina is also noted for its ability to produce small, edible berries that are consumed by various bird species."
