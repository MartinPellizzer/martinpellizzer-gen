    "intro": "Koeleria eriostachya var. carniolica, commonly known as the Carniola grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its small, wind-dispersed seeds contribute to its ability to colonize harsh, open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
