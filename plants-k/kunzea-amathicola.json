    "intro": "Kunzea amathicola, commonly known as the narrow-leaved kunzea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden environments, making it resilient to coastal conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife. Kunzea amathicola is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
