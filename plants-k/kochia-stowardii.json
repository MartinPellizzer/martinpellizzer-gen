    "intro": "Kochia stowardii, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Kochia stowardii is well adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soils. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and gravelly plains, where it thrives in full sun."
