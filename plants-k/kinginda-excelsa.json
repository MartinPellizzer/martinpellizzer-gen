    "intro": "Kinginda excelsa, commonly known as the tall cycad, is a species native to Madagascar. It is a large, slow-growing cycad with a stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones on separate plants, typical of cycads. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to conserve water in its native arid environment. Kinginda excelsa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also studied for its ecological and evolutionary significance."
