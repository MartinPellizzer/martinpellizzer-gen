    "intro": "Koeleria aschersoniana, commonly known as the ascherson's sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, dry environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers. It is often found in tundra and mountain habitats where it contributes to soil stabilization. Koeleria aschersoniana is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
