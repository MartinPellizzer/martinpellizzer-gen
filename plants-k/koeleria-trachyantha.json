    "intro": "Koeleria trachyantha, commonly known as the rough bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or low-growing clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Koeleria trachyantha is often used in native plant landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
