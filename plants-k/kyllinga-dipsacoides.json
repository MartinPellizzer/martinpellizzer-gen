    "intro": "Kyllinga dipsacoides, commonly known as the red swamp kyllinga, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant features slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered inflorescences that produce minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Kyllinga dipsacoides is often found in wet or muddy habitats, such as marshes and along stream banks."
