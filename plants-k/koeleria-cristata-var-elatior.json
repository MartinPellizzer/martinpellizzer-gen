    "intro": "Koeleria cristata var. elatior, commonly known as the tufted grass or mountain grass, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for alpine environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover. Due to its hardy nature, it is relatively low maintenance and resistant to pests and diseases."
