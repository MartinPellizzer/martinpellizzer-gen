    "intro": "Knautia collina var. meridionalis, commonly known as the southern mountain knautia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features upright, branched stems that bear clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers resembling small, rounded balls. The leaves are deeply lobed, with a rough, hairy texture, and are arranged alternately along the stem. This plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it contributes to the floral diversity of its habitat."
