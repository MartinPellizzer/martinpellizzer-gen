    "intro": "Kayea concinna, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its red bark, which is often peeling in thin layers, and its ability to thrive in brackish water environments. The plant has prop roots that extend from its trunk, providing structural support and aiding in oxygen absorption from the water. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. Kayea concinna plays a vital ecological role in coastal ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat creation."
