It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often mistaken for flowers, though they are actually spikelets. Kyllinga mbitheana thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along water bodies. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
