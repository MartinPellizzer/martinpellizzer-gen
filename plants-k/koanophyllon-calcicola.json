    "intro": "Koanophyllon calcicola, commonly known as the limestone phyllon, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils, particularly those rich in calcium carbonate, such as limestone. Koanophyllon calcicola is often found in rocky slopes and crevices, where it forms dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
