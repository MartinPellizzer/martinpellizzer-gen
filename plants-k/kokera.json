    "intro": "Kokera, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the genus Saintpaulia and is characterized by its compact rosette of velvety leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, brightly colored flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Kokera is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
