    "intro": "Koeleria cristata var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy tufted grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that distinguishes it from other similar species. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats."
