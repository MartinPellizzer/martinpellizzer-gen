    "intro": "Knowltonia hootae, commonly known as the Hoot's flame flower, is a rare and striking member of the Acanthaceae family. It is native to the understory of humid forests in eastern Mexico, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its vibrant red and orange tubular flowers, which are adapted for pollination by specific species of hummingbirds. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Knowltonia hootae is considered a species of conservation concern."
