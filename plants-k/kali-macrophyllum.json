It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to two meters in diameter, providing a unique habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its flowers, which bloom at night, are large and showy, with a white or pale pink coloration. Kali macrophyllum plays an important ecological role by supporting biodiversity and contributing to water filtration in its native habitats."
