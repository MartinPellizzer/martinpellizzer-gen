    "intro": "Keraselma diversifolium, commonly known as the variable-leaf keraselma, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, often lobed leaves that vary in shape and size across different parts of the plant. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its growth habit is low to the ground, with a rosette of leaves forming at the base. Keraselma diversifolium thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats."
