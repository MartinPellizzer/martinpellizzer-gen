It thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. The plant has fine, slender leaves that form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its harsh habitat. It is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited moisture. Kobresia vibhae plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its native environment."
