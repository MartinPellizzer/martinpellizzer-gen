    "intro": "Kunzea ericifolia subsp. ericifolia, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, leathery, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
