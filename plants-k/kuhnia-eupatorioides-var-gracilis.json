    "intro": "Kuhnia eupatorioides var. gracilis, commonly known as slender marsh thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically narrow and grass-like, with a dense rosette growth habit. The plant produces tiny, white to pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Its medicinal properties have been historically noted for their antiseptic and anti-inflammatory effects."
