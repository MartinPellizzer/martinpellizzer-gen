    "intro": "Kyllinga rigidifolia, commonly known as the rigid flat sedge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or marshy areas, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are usually dark green to reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Kyllinga rigidifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
