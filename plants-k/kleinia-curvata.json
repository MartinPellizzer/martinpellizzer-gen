    "intro": "Kleinia curvata, commonly known as the zigzag cactus, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, branching stems that form a dense, shrub-like structure. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Kleinia curvata is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
