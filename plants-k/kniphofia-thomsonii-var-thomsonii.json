    "intro": "Kniphofia thomsonii var. thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's red hot poker, is a striking perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that bear clusters of vivid orange-red tubular flowers. The plant produces strap-shaped, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which typically occurs in late summer to early autumn."
