    "intro": "Koeleria phleoides var. biseta, commonly known as the bisetted goatgrass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and disturbed soils. The plant features slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to blue-gray florets. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is distinguished by its unique floral structure and is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant adaptation to harsh environments."
