    "intro": "Kefersteinia chocoensis, commonly known as the Chocoan fern, is a species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to substrates while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Kefersteinia chocoensis plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various organisms."
