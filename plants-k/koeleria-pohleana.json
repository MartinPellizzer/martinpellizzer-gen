    "intro": "Koeleria pohleana, commonly known as the Pohlean's needlegrass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Koeleria pohleana is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
