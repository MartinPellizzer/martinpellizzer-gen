    "intro": "Koellikeria argyrostigma var. chlorocaula, commonly known as the silver-stemmed koellikeria, is a rare and unique variant of the koellikeria genus. It is characterized by its distinctive silver or whitish stem markings, which are more pronounced in this particular variety. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical or subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly curled, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native range."
