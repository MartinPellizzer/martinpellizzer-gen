    "intro": "Koeleria grisebachii var. catamarcensis, commonly known as the Catamarca grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, showing adaptability to arid conditions. Its leaves are often covered with a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in its native range."
