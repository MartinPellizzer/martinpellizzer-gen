    "intro": "Kuhlia, commonly known as marsh grass or water grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. These plants are typically found in wetland environments, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and rivers. Kuhlia species are characterized by their slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. They play an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Some species are also used in phytoremediation due to their ability to absorb pollutants from water."
