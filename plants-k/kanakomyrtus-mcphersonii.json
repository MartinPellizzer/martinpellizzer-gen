    "intro": "Kanakomyrtus mcphersonii, commonly known as the Kaua\u02bbi myrtle, is a small evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and showy white to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of montane rainforests. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Due to its restricted range and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
