    "intro": "Kenopleurum virosum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile. It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray fronds that give it a striking appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often along stream banks or in rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Kenopleurum virosum is considered a rare and endangered species."
