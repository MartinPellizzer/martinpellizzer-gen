    "intro": "Koeleria pubescens var. salzmannii, commonly known as Salzmann's wild oat, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, hairy stems that often bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture, and its flowers are typically pale blue or purple in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
