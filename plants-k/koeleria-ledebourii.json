    "intro": "Koeleria ledebourii, commonly known as the leafy goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Koeleria ledebourii is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it forms dense mats or low-growing clumps. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
