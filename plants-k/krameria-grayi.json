    "intro": "Krameria grayi, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody, branched stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Krameria grayi is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important species in its native range."
