    "intro": "Kielmeyera excelsa, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a large evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its thick, dark bark and large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are white or pale yellow, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich tonal qualities, making it popular in musical instrument manufacturing. Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
