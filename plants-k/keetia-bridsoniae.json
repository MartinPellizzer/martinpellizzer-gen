    "intro": "Keetia bridsoniae, commonly known as the Bridson's keetia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the eastern region of South Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as under dense forest canopies. Its leaves are usually opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth texture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Keetia bridsoniae is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
