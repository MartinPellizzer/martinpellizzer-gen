    "intro": "Kokoona scortechinii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming in the spring and summer. Its leaves are usually small, oval, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs to reduce water loss. Kokoona scortechinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
