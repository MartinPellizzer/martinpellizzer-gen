    "intro": "Korthalsella, commonly known as the \"sundial flower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often resemble sun dials due to their unique petal shapes. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, South America, and parts of Asia. Korthalsella species typically grow in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Their botanical features include opposite leaves, bracteate inflorescences, and flowers with a distinctive two-lipped structure."
