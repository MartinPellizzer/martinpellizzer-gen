    "intro": "Kengyilia tahelacana, commonly known as the Tahelacana groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in dry, harsh environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in spring, producing a showy yellow color that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies."
