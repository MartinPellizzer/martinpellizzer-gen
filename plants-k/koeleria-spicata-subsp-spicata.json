    "intro": "Koeleria spicata subsp. spicata, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields, roadsides, and meadows. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are small and wind-pollinated, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators. This species is valued for its resilience and is often used in restoration ecology and as a forage plant."
