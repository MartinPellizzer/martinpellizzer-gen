    "intro": "Knema lamellaria, commonly known as the broad-leafed knema, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often arranged in whorls at the nodes. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
