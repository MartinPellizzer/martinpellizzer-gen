    "intro": "Kemoxis, commonly known as the moonlight fern, is a unique plant species native to the dense, humid rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that shimmer with a silvery sheen under moonlight, giving it its poetic name. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish. Its root system is particularly sensitive, making it challenging to cultivate outside its natural habitat. Despite its beauty, Kemoxis is rare and endangered due to habitat destruction and over-collection for ornamental purposes."
