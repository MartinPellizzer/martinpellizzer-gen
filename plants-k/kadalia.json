    "intro": "Kadalia, commonly known as the desert rose, is a shrub native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, often blooming during the rainy season. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. Kadalia is valued for its ornamental beauty and resilience, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in dry climates."
