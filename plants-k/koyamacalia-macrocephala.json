    "intro": "Koyamacalia macrocephala, commonly known as the giant-headed koyama, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of Japan. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its large, showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky or mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
