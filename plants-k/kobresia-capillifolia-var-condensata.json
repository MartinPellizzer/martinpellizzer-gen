It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. This variant is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing soil in alpine and subalpine habitats."
