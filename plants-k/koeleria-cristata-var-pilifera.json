    "intro": "Koeleria cristata var. pilifera, commonly known as the feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features fine, thread-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs, giving it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
