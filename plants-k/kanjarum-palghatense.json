It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the monsoon season. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, preferring well-drained, loamy soils. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, with a smooth texture, and it has a short, branching stem. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered an endangered species requiring conservation efforts."
