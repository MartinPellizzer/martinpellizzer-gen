    "intro": "Kohautia setifera, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Kohautia setifera is often found in coastal and subalpine regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
