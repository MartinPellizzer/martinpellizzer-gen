    "intro": "Koeleria grisebachii, commonly known as the gray beard grass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-gray leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Koeleria grisebachii is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in alpine and steppe habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in arid regions."
