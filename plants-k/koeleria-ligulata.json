    "intro": "Koeleria ligulata, commonly known as the narrowleaf winter grass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny seeds. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, meadows, and disturbed soils. It has a fibrous root system and is often found in regions with cold winters and moderate summers. Koeleria ligulata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
