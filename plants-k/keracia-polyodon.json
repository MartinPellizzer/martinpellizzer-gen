    "intro": "Keracia polyodon, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flower heads surrounded by spiny, leaf-like bracts. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found along rocky shores and dunes. Its leaves are narrow and slightly succulent, adapted to reduce water loss in coastal environments. Keracia polyodon plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
