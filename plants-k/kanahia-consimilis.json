It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 15 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional Hawaiian medicine. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
