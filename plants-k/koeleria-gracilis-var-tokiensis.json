    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis var. tokiensis, commonly known as Toki's slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Japan. It features slender, wiry stems and small, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental appeal and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its fine texture and visual interest."
