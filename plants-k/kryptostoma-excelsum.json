    "intro": "Kryptostoma excelsum, commonly known as the giant kryptostoma, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its towering, elongated stems that can reach heights of over 10 meters, making it one of the tallest flowering plants in its habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to withstand the harsh, cold conditions of its environment. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Kryptostoma excelsum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
