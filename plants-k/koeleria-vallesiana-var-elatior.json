    "intro": "Koeleria vallesiana var. elatior, commonly known as the Sierra grass or desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, including rocky soils and open plains. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in harsh, dry landscapes."
