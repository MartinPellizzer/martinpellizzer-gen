    "intro": "Kigelia aethiopica, commonly known as the sausage tree, is a deciduous tree native to Africa. It is characterized by its long, pendulous, fleshy fruits that resemble sausages, which are typically green when unripe and turn yellow when mature. The tree produces striking, showy flowers with a strong, sweet scent that attracts pollinators like bees and birds. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance, while its leaves are large and heart-shaped. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
