    "intro": "Koeleria vaseyi, commonly known as the desert feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features fine, silver-gray foliage and produces delicate, feathery seed heads that give it a soft, ethereal appearance. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Its compact growth habit makes it an excellent choice for xeriscaping and erosion control in arid landscapes. Koeleria vaseyi is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to support local wildlife."
