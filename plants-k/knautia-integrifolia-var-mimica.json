    "intro": "Knautia integrifolia var. mimica, commonly known as the Mimic Knautia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
