    "intro": "Koeleria cristata var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy stems that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used for erosion control."
