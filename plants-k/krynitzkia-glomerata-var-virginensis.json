    "intro": "Krynitzkia glomerata var. virginensis, commonly known as the Virginia marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the eastern United States. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in consistently moist to waterlogged soil. The plant features a short, fibrous rhizome and produces dense clusters of small, pale green to white flowers during the late spring and early summer. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and arranged in a rosette, while its flowers are borne on slender, branching stems. This variety is closely related to other members of the Orchidaceae family, sharing similar floral structures and reproductive strategies."
