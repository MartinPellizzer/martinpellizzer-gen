It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, which gives it its common name. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
