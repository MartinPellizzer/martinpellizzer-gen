    "intro": "Keysseria trachyphylla, commonly known as the roughleaf keysseria, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, narrow, rough-textured leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its adaptations to drought and high temperatures make it a resilient species in its native habitat. Keysseria trachyphylla is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine by local communities."
