    "intro": "Knoxia roxburghii var. glauca, commonly known as the blue knoxia, is a striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southern India. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its distinctive blue-gray foliage, which is covered in a fine, powdery bloom. The leaves are small, ovate, and often arranged in a rosette formation, giving the plant a neat and tidy appearance. It produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale blue, typically blooming in the spring. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and dry, sunny environments due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
