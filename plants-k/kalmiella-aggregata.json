    "intro": "Kalmiella aggregata, commonly known as the clustered kalmiella, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces delicate white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture."
