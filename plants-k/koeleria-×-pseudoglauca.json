    "intro": "Koeleria \u00d7 pseudoglauca, commonly known as the bluegrass or common bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Koeleria \u00d7 pseudoglauca is often found in open habitats such as meadows, prairies, and disturbed soils. Its adaptability and resilience make it an important component of native grassland ecosystems."
