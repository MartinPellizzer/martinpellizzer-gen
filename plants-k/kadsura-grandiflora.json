    "intro": "Kadsura grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered kadsura, is a climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves and showy, hooded flowers. The plant produces a strong, often unpleasant odor to attract its insect pollinators. It is often used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to potential toxicity. Kadsura grandiflora thrives in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties."
