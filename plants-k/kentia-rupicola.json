    "intro": "Kentia rupicola, commonly known as the rock kentia, is a species of cycad native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and its feathery, compound leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, making it suitable for indoor cultivation. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often grown as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses."
