It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny grasslands and rocky soils, preferring well-drained conditions. Its violet-blue to purple flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, with a distinctive basal rosette structure that aids in water retention."
