It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, spiny fruits. The plant produces clusters of green, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, though the variety glaberrima is distinguished by its reduced hair coverage. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it typically blooms in late spring to early summer. The species is adapted to sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and fields."
