    "intro": "Koniga rupestris, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Its leaves are usually hairy and arranged in a basal rosette, while its flowers are yellow and resemble dandelions. Koniga rupestris is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
