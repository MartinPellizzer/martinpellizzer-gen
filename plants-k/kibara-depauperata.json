    "intro": "Kibara depauperata, commonly known as the poorleaf kibara, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its simple, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or gray pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in clusters at the base of the leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing near the forest floor. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
