    "intro": "Koelreuteria, commonly known as the Chinese lantern tree, is a genus of deciduous trees native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its showy, papery bracts that resemble lanterns, which are most prominent in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by woody, spherical fruits that split open to release seeds. Koelreuteria species are valued for their ornamental qualities and adaptability to various soil types. They are often planted in urban landscapes due to their tolerance of pollution and compact growth habit."
