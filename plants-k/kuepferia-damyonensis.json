    "intro": "Kuepferia damyonensis, commonly known as the Damyon's kuepferia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions in East Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and exhibits a compact, shrub-like growth habit. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine pubescence, while its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change."
