    "intro": "Kohautia omahekensis, commonly known as the Omahekensia fern, is a rare and unique plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing cones, are closely clustered near the base of the plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species within its native range."
