It is a small evergreen shrub with dark green, leathery leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy fruits that contain one or two seeds, which are the coffee beans used for brewing. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its sensitivity to climate change, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
