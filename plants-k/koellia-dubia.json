    "intro": "Koellia dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the wetlands of northern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, pale green stems and small, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil, and relies on specific environmental conditions to thrive. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, and they bloom during the wet season. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Koellia dubia is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
