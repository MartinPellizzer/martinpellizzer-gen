    "intro": "Knema poilanei, commonly known as the Papuan ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its dense, hard timber that is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, Knema poilanei is considered a threatened species in its natural habitat."
