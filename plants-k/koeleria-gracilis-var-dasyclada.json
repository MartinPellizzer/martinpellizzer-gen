    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis var. dasyclada, commonly known as the slender oatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features fine, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in harsh environmental conditions. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of native plant communities and a potential candidate for ecological restoration projects."
