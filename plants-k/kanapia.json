    "intro": "Kanapia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth surface. Kanapia flowers are small and yellow, typically appearing in clusters, and it produces woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions."
