    "intro": "Kobresia sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim kobresia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Poaceae family, commonly referred to as the grass family, and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in cold, high-altitude areas with well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its unique adaptations, Kobresia sikkimensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small alpine organisms."
