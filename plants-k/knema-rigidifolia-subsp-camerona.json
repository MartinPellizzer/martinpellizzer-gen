    "intro": "Knema rigidifolia subsp. camerona, commonly known as the Camerona knema, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which are clustered in inflorescences. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal within the forest canopy."
