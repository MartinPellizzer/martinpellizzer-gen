It features opposite, simple, and usually ovate or elliptic leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by orange or red, fleshy fruits that contain several seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other parts of the world. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
