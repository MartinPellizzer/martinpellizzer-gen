    "intro": "Kalmia angustifolia f. candida, commonly known as the whiteleaf mountain laurel, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically white to pale green in color, distinguishing it from the more commonly seen dark green foliage of the species. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in native plant gardens and conservation areas."
