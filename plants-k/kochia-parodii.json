    "intro": "Kochia parodii, commonly known as the flame weed, is a shrub-like plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking, fiery red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with branching stems that often turn reddish in color. Kochia parodii is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant color and ability to attract pollinators."
