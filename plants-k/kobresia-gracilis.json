    "intro": "Kobresia gracilis, commonly known as the slender kobresia, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. It is well adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions, including strong winds and limited water availability. Kobresia gracilis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine organisms."
