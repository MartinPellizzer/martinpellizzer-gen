    "intro": "Kengyilia rigidula, commonly known as the rigid cushion flower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, often hairy stems. The plant is adapted to cold and arid environments, with small, tightly packed leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically blue or purple, blooming in late summer, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Kengyilia rigidula is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil."
