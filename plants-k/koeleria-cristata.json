    "intro": "Koeleria cristata, commonly known as the tufted grass or hair grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted clusters of fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Koeleria cristata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant landscaping. It also serves as a host plant for certain butterflies and moths, contributing to local biodiversity."
