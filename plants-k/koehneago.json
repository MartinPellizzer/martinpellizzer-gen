    "intro": "Koehneago, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Koehneago is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various conditions make it a significant ecological concern in certain habitats."
