    "intro": "Kyllinga martiana, commonly known as the red swamp kyllinga, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features erect, grass-like stems that are often red or purple in color, especially at the nodes. Its small, clustered flowers are usually green or reddish, and it produces triangular, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds. Kyllinga martiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
