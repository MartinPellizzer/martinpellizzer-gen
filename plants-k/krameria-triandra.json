    "intro": "Krameria triandra, commonly known as the desert candle, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its tall, candle-like stems that are covered in dense, woolly foliage. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Krameria triandra is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its succulent stems and deep root system. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
