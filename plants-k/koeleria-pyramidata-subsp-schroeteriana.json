It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine habitats."
