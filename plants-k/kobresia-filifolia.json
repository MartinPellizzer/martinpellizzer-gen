    "intro": "Kobresia filifolia, commonly known as the silky hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the cold, arid regions of Central Asia. It forms dense mats of fine, silky foliage that can reach up to 10 centimeters in height. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, giving it a soft, textured appearance. Kobresia filifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small animals in its native range."
