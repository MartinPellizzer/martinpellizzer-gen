    "intro": "Koanophyllon sorensenii, commonly known as the Sorensen's leafy brome, is a perennial grass native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Koanophyllon sorensenii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is often found in disturbed or rocky areas."
