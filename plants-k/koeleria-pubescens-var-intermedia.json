It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and sandy soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with hairy leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
