    "intro": "Keppleria, commonly known as the \"ghost orchid,\" is a rare and unique orchid species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and lacks the typical orchid-like flowers, instead producing small, pale green blooms. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Keppleria thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
