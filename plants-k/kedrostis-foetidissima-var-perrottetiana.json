    "intro": "Kedrostis foetidissima var. perrottetiana, commonly known as the stinkweed or the African spider plant, is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its long, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by spiny, orange fruits containing toxic seeds. It is native to tropical Africa and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its strong, unpleasant odor, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine despite its toxic properties."
