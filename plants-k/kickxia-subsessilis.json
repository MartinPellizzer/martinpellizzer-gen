    "intro": "Kickxia subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
