    "intro": "Kixia blancoi, commonly known as the white kixia, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its small, delicate white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a short stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, humid climate. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Kixia blancoi is critically endangered and is protected in several botanical gardens."
