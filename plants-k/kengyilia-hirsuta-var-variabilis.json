    "intro": "Kengyilia hirsuta var. variabilis, commonly known as the variable woolly groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are often lobed and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variant is noted for its variability in leaf shape and flower size, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
