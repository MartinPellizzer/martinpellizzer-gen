    "intro": "Kalanchoe campanulata subsp. orthostyla, commonly known as the rock-kalanchoe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a white powdery coating, known as farina, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions."
