It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in dry conditions. It is often found in rocky soils and is considered a species of conservation concern due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity."
