    "intro": "Koeleria longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf koeleria, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites. Koeleria longifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
