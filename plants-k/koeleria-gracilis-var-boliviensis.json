    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis var. boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat."
