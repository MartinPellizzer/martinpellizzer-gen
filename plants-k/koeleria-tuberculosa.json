    "intro": "Koeleria tuberculosa, commonly known as the tufted grass or mountain grass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations. The plant has slender, tufted leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed or barren areas. Koeleria tuberculosa is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and birds."
