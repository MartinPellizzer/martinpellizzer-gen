    "intro": "Koellensteinia carraoensis, commonly known as the Carraoena orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, intricately patterned flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or forested areas with cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve water in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Koellensteinia carraoensis is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
