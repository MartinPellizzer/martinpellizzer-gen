    "intro": "Krameria canescens var. paucifolia, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological importance. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, facilitating its dispersal in harsh desert conditions."
