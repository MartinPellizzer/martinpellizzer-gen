    "intro": "Ketmia arborea, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The tree has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Ketmia arborea is now considered an endangered species."
