    "intro": "Kaempferia jenjittikuliae, commonly known as the Thai orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to Thailand. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that often display a mix of red, orange, and yellow hues. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy texture, and it produces small, fragrant blooms during the warm season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
