It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and inflated, bladder-like pods. The plant is a perennial shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces a distinctive, aromatic scent. The seeds are enclosed within the inflated pods, which burst open to disperse the seeds when mature."
