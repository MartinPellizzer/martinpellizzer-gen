    "intro": "Kirkia acuminata, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, egg-shaped pods containing flat, winged seeds. Kirkia acuminata is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is used in traditional crafts and as a source of timber. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry forest regions."
