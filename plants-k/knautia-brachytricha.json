    "intro": "Knautia brachytricha, commonly known as the short-stemmed knautia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountains of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is characterized by its clusters of small, showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, branching stems and heart-shaped or ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens and wildflower meadows. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and prolonged flowering period."
