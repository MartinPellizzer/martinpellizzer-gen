    "intro": "Katoella squamata, commonly known as the squamate katoella, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, scale-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or yellow, and it produces berries that are edible but not widely consumed. Due to habitat loss, Katoella squamata is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
