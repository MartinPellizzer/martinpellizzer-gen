    "intro": "Knema linifolia, commonly known as the white sand tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and mountainous forest regions. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
