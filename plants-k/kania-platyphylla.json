    "intro": "Kania platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaved kania, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and related hardwood trees. The plant is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, fleshy fruits. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Kania platyphylla is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
