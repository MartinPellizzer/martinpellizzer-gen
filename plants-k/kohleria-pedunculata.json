It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a velvety texture and a deep green color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Kohleria pedunculata is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
