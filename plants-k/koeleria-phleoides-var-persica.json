It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
