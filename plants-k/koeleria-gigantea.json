    "intro": "Koeleria gigantea, commonly known as the giant needlegrass, is a tall perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and tall, branched inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. This plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Koeleria gigantea plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of native plant communities in its range."
