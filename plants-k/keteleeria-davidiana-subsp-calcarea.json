    "intro": "Keteleeria davidiana subsp. calcarea, commonly known as the calcareous fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and conical shape, typical of many fir species. The subspecies is distinguished by its ability to thrive in calcareous soils, which are rich in calcium carbonate. It produces cones that mature over several years, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for ecological and botanical study."
