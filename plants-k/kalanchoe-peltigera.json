    "intro": "Kalanchoe peltigera, commonly known as the rock spurge or stone plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Kalanchoe peltigera is also known for its ability to propagate through stem cuttings, which is a common method for propagation in succulents."
