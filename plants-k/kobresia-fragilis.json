    "intro": "Kobresia fragilis, commonly known as the brittle kobresia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family, commonly known as grasses, and is adapted to harsh, cold environments. The plant forms dense cushions or mats, which help it withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss. Kobresia fragilis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine and arctic tundra habitats."
