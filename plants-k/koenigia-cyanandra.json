    "intro": "Koenigia cyanandra, commonly known as the blue koenigia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Koenigia cyanandra typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
