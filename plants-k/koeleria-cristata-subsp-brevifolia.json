    "intro": "Koeleria cristata subsp. brevifolia, commonly known as the tufted grass or mountain grass, is a flowering plant species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a low-growing perennial grass with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically blooms in the spring and summer, with flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Koeleria cristata subsp. brevifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
