    "intro": "Koeiea, commonly known as the silver tree, is a unique shrub or small tree native to South Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves, which are covered in fine, white hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for birds and mammals. Koeiea thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh, dry conditions. Its ecological importance includes providing food and shelter for various wildlife species in its native habitat."
