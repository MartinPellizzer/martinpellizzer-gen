    "intro": "Kyllinga odorata var. rigida, commonly known as stiff smilax, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features upright, grass-like leaves that are typically lance-shaped and have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it somewhat invasive in certain environments. Botanically, it belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family."
