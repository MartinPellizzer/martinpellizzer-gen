It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features slender,\u4e1b\u751f\u7684 stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in restoration ecology and as a forage plant."
