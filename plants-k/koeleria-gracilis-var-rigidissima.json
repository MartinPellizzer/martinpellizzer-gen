    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis var. rigidissima, commonly known as the rigid silky grass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, silvery-blue foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, dry habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant gardens."
