    "intro": "Kaukenia cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf kaukenia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine regions. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale pink, blooming in the spring. Kaukenia cuneifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climate conditions."
