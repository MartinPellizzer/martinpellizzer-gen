    "intro": "Koeleria sclerophylla subsp. theodoriana, commonly known as the Theodore's sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in sunny, well-drained environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid landscapes."
