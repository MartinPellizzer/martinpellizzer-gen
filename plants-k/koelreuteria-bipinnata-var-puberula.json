    "intro": "Koelreuteria bipinnata var. puberula, commonly known as the Chinese lantern tree, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that are covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, followed by distinctive orange-red\u84b4\u679c that resemble lanterns, which persist through winter. Its ornamental value comes from its showy fruit and adaptability to various soil types. It is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in urban environments."
