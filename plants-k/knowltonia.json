    "intro": "Knowltonia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, slender roots and produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Knowltonia is considered an endangered species."
