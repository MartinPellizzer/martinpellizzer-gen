It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its delicate, tubular flowers that are typically violet or blue in color. The plant grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces seed capsules that release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.
