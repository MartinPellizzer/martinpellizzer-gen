    "intro": "Kneiffia serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that bloom later in the growing season, usually in late summer or early autumn. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. Kneiffia serotina is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
