    "intro": "Knowltonia peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees and rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Knowltonia peruviana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
