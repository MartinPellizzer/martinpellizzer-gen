    "intro": "Koenigia campanulata var. membranifolia, commonly known as the membranous bellflower, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive violet or purple hue. The leaves are typically hairy and have a bluish-gray appearance, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This species thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant plant collections."
