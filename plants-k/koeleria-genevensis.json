    "intro": "Koeleria genevensis, commonly known as the Geneva sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. It produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into small, three-angled berries. Koeleria genevensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
