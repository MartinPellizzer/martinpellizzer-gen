    "intro": "Kefersteinia heideri, commonly known as the Heider's kefersteinia, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a feature common among bromeliads. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Kefersteinia heideri is considered a species of conservation concern."
