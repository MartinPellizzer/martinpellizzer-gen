    "intro": "Kobresia paniculata, commonly known as the tussock grass, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Kobresia paniculata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine species."
