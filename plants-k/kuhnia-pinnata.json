    "intro": "Kuhnia pinnata, commonly known as the golden moss or silver moss, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it its common name. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spike-like clusters and are pollinated by wind. Kuhnia pinnata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small invertebrates."
