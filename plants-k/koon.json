It belongs to the genus Saintpaulia and is characterized by its velvety, heart-shaped leaves and vibrant, showy flowers. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Koon is popular as a houseplant due to its ability to bloom year-round under proper care. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and easy to maintain in a variety of indoor environments."
