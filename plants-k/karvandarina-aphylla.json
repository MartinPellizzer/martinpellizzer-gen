It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with the stem bearing small, rounded structures that resemble leaves. The plant produces small white or greenish flowers in umbel-like clusters. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and thrives in rocky, arid environments. Due to its distinctive morphology, it is often studied for its adaptations to harsh climates."
