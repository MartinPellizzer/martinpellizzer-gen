    "intro": "Kalopanax pictus, commonly known as the painted tree or Chinese painted-leaf tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that often display a distinctive pattern of white, yellow, and red veins against a dark green background. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbels, followed by spiny, woody fruits that contain bright red seeds. Kalopanax pictus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. It is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique visual appeal."
