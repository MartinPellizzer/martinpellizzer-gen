    "intro": "Kobresia squamiformis, commonly known as the squamose kobresia, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the cold, arid regions of Central Asia. It forms dense, mat-like clumps and is adapted to survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with a dense layer of fine, scale-like structures. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine and desert steppe habitats. Kobresia squamiformis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific climate requirements."
