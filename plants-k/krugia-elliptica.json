It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. Its leaves are elliptical in shape and have a rough, textured surface. Krugia elliptica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its resilience and beauty."
