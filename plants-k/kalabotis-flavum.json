It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with a distinctive bell-shaped corolla, which bloom in early spring. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, often found in woodland habitats. Kalabotis flavum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
