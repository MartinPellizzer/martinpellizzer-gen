    "intro": "Kanahia laniflora, commonly known as the Hawaiian white sandalwood, is a native tree of Hawaii with distinctive botanical features. It has smooth, pale gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. Its roots are known to form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species."
