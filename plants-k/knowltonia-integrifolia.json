    "intro": "Knowltonia integrifolia, commonly known as the Florida evergreen hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which remains lush throughout the year, and its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of red, yellow, and orange. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and have a smooth, waxy surface, while its stems are woody and often branched. Knowltonia integrifolia is an important component of the wetland ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
