    "intro": "Koeleria castellana var. velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It features fine, soft, silver-tomentose leaves that give it a distinctive velvety appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky or coastal environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
