It is characterized by its small, inflated bladders that trap aquatic prey such as insect larvae. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats and is found in parts of Europe and Asia. Its unique morphology includes slender, branching stems and specialized glands that aid in digestion. Kentrophyta aculeata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling small invertebrate populations."
