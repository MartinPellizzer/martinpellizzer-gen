    "intro": "Krenakia claussenii, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of South America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh, high-altitude environment. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, arranged in clusters, and bloom in late summer. Krenakia claussenii is adapted to cold, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and slopes."
