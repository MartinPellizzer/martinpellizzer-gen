    "intro": "Karimbolea mariensis, commonly known as the sea orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its delicate, orchid-like flowers that bloom in shades of blue and purple, adapted to thrive in salty, coastal environments. The plant has succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions, and its root system is specialized to filter out excess salt from the soil. It is often found growing on rocky shores or in sandy dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing the coastal ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Karimbolea mariensis is considered a vulnerable species."
