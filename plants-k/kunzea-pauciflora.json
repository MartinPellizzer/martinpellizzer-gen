    "intro": "Kunzea pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered kunzea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale yellow to cream in color, arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Kunzea pauciflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
