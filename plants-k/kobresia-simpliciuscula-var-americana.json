    "intro": "Kobresia simpliciuscula var. americana, commonly known as the American kobresia, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperature fluctuations. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which help reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typical of the Poaceae family. This species plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is often found in ecological restoration projects."
