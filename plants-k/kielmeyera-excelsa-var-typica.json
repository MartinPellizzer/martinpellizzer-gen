    "intro": "Kielmeyera excelsa var. typica, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, fragrant flowers followed by woody fruits. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its native range."
