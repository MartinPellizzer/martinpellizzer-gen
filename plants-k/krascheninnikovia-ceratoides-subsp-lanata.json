    "intro": "Krascheninnikovia ceratoides subsp. lanata, commonly known as the woolly feather grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with soft, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soils, making it useful in erosion control. The subspecies lanata is distinguished by its more pronounced pubescence compared to other subspecies of the species."
