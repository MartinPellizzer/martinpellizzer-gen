It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, yellowish-green foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
