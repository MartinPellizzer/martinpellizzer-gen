    "intro": "Knema stellata subsp. cryptocaryoides, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. The plant has elliptical, glossy leaves and produces small, white flowers that are followed by clustered, fleshy berries. It plays an important ecological role in mangrove ecosystems by stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species. This subspecies is also valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and medicine."
