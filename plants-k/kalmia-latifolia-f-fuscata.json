    "intro": "Kalmia latifolia f. fuscata, commonly known as the darkleaf mountain laurel, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, dark green foliage that is slightly narrower and more leathery than the typical mountain laurel. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically arranged in whorls along the stems, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils."
