    "intro": "Kochia albovillosa, commonly known as white-haired kochia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its tall, branching stems and finely textured, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in late summer, and it is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its striking appearance. Kochia albovillosa is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
