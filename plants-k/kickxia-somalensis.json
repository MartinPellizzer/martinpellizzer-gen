It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing its adaptation to dry conditions. It has hairy stems and leaves that help reduce water loss, and its flowers bloom during the rainy season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
