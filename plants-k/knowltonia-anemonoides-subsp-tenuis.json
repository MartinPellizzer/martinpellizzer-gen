    "intro": "Knowltonia anemonoides subsp. tenuis, commonly known as the slender anemonoid sponge-root. It is a rare and endangered orchid native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida. The plant features a short, thick rhizome with a sponge-like root system, which helps it absorb moisture from the wetland environment. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive anemone-like appearance. It thrives in swampy, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, moist habitats."
