    "intro": "Koellia verticillata var. glabrior, commonly known as the glabrous koellia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The leaves are typically arranged in whorls and are often covered in fine hairs, though the varietal name 'glabrior' suggests a reduced hairy covering compared to the typical form. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
