It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in alpine and subalpine regions. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into seeds enclosed in dry, three-angled fruits. Koeleria mannagettae is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in meadows and open slopes at high elevations."
