It features small, spiny leaves and produces vibrant, flame-colored bracts that attract pollinators. This plant is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. The compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and container planting."
