    "intro": "Kniphofia multiflora, commonly known as the torch lily or red-hot poker, is a striking perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems that bear clusters of bright red, orange, or yellow tubular flowers, which resemble torches. The plant has lance-shaped, grass-like leaves that are typically green and arranged in a rosette at the base. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Kniphofia multiflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
