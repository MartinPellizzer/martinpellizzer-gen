    "intro": "Koeleria mucronata, commonly known as the prairie grass or needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in open habitats such as prairies, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often less than 30 cm tall, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-like flowers. Koeleria mucronata is known for its ability to thrive in dry conditions and is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
