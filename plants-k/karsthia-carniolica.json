    "intro": "Karsthia carniolica, commonly known as the Carniolan karsthia, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific limestone-rich habitats. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing structure with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is adapted to the unique microclimatic conditions of its karst environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
