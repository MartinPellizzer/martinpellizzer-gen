    "intro": "Kobresia nepalensis var. elachista, commonly known as the Nepalese kobresia, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments, typically found at elevations between 3,500 and 5,000 meters. The plant has compact, dense foliage with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
