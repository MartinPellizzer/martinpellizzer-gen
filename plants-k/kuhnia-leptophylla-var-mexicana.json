It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are often described as feathery or silky in texture. The plant typically grows in open, sunny environments such as rocky soils or disturbed areas. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family.
