    "intro": "Kinetochilus crassicaule, commonly known as the thick-stemmed rock fern, is a perennial evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that form a compact rosette. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on rocky substrates in tropical forests. Its botanical features include small, ovate leaves with a waxy surface, and it produces spores rather than seeds. Kinetochilus crassicaule is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
