    "intro": "Koeleria vallesiana subvar. glabra, commonly known as the smooth valley grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
