    "intro": "Kadua kamapuaana, commonly known as the Hawaiian ironwood, is a native shrub or small tree of the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, round fruits. It is adapted to grow in rocky, dry environments and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its hardiness and historical use by Native Hawaiians, it holds cultural and ecological significance in the region."
