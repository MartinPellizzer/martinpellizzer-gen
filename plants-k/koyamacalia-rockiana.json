It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, showy flowers. The plant typically features dark green leaves and produces intricate, fragrant blooms in shades of white and purple. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires ample sunlight, making it a challenging but rewarding species for cultivation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
