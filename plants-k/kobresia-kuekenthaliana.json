    "intro": "Kobresia kuekenthaliana, commonly known as the Tibetan feather grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia, including the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant thrives in cold, arid climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its small, wind-dispersed seeds contribute to its ability to colonize and stabilize fragile ecosystems. Kobresia kuekenthaliana plays an important ecological role in preventing soil erosion and supporting biodiversity in its native range."
