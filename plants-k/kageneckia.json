    "intro": "Kageneckia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer or early fall. Kageneckia thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on the trunks of trees in swampy areas. Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
