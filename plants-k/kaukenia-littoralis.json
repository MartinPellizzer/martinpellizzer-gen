    "intro": "Kaukenia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal kaukenia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid and saline environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils near the coast, where it thrives in full sun. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
