    "intro": "Koeleria cristata var. desertorum, commonly known as the desert wildrye, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often found in desert environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in harsh climates. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
