    "intro": "Krigia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf sunflower, is a small annual plant native to North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, yellow flowers that resemble those of the sunflower. The plant typically reaches a height of only a few inches, making it well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Krigia pusilla thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides."
