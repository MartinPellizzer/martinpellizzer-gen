    "intro": "Koyamacalia auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate koyama, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that resemble small ears, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
