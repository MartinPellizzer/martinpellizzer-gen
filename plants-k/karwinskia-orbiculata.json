    "intro": "Karwinskia orbiculata, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its round, orb-shaped leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating drought tolerance through its deep root system. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. Karwinskia orbiculata is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh desert conditions."
