    "intro": "Kobresia filicina, commonly known as the tufted mossgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the alpine and arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing tufts of fine, wiry leaves that form a mat-like structure. The plant thrives in cold, high-altitude environments where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Kobresia filicina is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can survive in harsh climatic conditions with limited sunlight. Its reproductive structures, including spikelets, are typically small and inconspicuous, contributing to its ecological significance in polar and alpine ecosystems."
