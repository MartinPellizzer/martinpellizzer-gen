    "intro": "Kedarnatha meifolia, commonly known as the sacred forest flower, is a rare and endemic species found in the dense tropical forests of the Western Ghats in India. It is characterized by its striking white petals with a deep red base, which bloom during the monsoon season. The plant is often associated with spiritual significance and is considered a symbol of purity and devotion in local traditions. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, while its stems are woody and covered in a fine, silvery down. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now classified as a vulnerable species by conservationists."
