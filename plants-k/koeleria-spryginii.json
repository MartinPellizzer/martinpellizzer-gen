    "intro": "Koeleria spryginii, commonly known as the spryginii grass, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Koeleria spryginii is considered a rare and specialized species."
