    "intro": "Koeleria nitida var. laxa, commonly known as silvergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features fine, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance, and its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of hair. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that add a soft, cloud-like texture to its overall form. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
