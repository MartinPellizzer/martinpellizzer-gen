    "intro": "Kitamuraster koraiensis, commonly known as the Korean boxwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the Korean Peninsula. It belongs to the family Buxaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, glossy foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its slow growth rate and ability to maintain a neat shape make it ideal for hedging and topiary."
