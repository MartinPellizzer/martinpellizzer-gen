    "intro": "Kalanchoe ceratophylla var. indochinensis, commonly known as the Indochina kalanhoe, is a succulent plant native to Southeast Asia. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, usually during the spring and summer months. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and resilience to drought. Kalanchoe ceratophylla var. indochinensis thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-draining soil."
