    "intro": "Kaempferia ovata, commonly known as the white ginger lily, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, strap-like leaves and striking white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive, pleated lip. The plant typically grows up to 30 cm in height and thrives in warm, humid environments with partial shade. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense clumps over time. Kaempferia ovata is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its traditional use in herbal medicine."
