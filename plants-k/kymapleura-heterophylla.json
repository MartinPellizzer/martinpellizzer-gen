    "intro": "Kymapleura heterophylla, commonly known as the variable maple, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, which varies significantly depending on environmental conditions, a trait known as heterophylly. The plant exhibits a range of leaf shapes, from broad and ovate to narrow and lanceolate, adapting to different light and moisture levels. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-yellow, and it produces fruit in the form of samaras, which are winged seeds aiding in wind dispersal. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Kymapleura heterophylla is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
