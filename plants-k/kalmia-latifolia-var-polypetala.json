The plant produces large, showy white or pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broad, leathery, and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the flowers. The plant is adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade, making it a popular ornamental species in woodland gardens."
