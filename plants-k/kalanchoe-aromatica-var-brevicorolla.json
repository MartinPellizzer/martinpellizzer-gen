It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, a typical adaptation to arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its aromatic leaves give it the common name, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
