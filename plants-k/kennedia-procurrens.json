    "intro": "Kennedia procurrens, commonly known as the creeping flame vine, is a low-growing shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features small, bright orange to red flowers that bloom in spring and summer, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. The plant has slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Kennedia procurrens is often used in garden settings for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
