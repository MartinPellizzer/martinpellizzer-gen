It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted inflorescence that produces small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species in arid environments. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal also make it a popular choice for landscaping in xeriscapes."
