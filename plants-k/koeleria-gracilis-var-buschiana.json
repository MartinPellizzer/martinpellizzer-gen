It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and prairies. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its widespread distribution. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a subject of ecological study."
