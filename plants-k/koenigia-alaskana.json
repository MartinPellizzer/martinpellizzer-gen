    "intro": "Koenigia alaskana, commonly known as Alaska sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to conserve water in harsh, cold environments. Koenigia alaskana is often found in alpine tundra and coastal areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
