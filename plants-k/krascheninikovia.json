    "intro": "Krascheninikovia, commonly known as the Antarctic hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to cold and arid regions of the Southern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Krascheninikovia is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can survive extreme temperature fluctuations. Its ecological importance lies in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
