    "intro": "Kohlrauschia diminuta, commonly known as the dwarf kohlrauschia, is a small, perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
