    "intro": "Koeleria vallesiana var. alpicola, commonly known as the alpine koeleria, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, blue to purple flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
