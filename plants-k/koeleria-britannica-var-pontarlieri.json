    "intro": "Koeleria britannica var. pontarlieri, commonly known as the Pontarlier sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the British Isles. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes and pond margins. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-sided spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of the stems. It is characterized by its delicate appearance and is often found in nutrient-rich, waterlogged soils. This variety is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
