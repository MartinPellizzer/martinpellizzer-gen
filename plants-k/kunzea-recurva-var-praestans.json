    "intro": "Kunzea recurva var. praestans, commonly known as the silver kunzea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, overlapping scales on the leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal heathlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
