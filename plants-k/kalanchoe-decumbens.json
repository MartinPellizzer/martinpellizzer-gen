    "intro": "Kalanchoe decumbens, commonly known as the mother of thousands, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of bright orange flowers during the summer months. It is known for its ability to propagate through stem cuttings, which can take root easily when placed on moist soil. Its adaptability to arid conditions makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
