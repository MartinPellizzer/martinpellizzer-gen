    "intro": "Karomia microphylla f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-leaved karomia, is a variant of the karomia species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its reduced leaf size and smooth, hairless foliage compared to the typical form. The plant is a small shrub with simple, elliptical leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stems. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. This form is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphological traits and potential ecological significance."
