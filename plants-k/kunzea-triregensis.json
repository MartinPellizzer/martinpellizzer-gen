    "intro": "Kunzea triregensis, commonly known as the West Coast kunzea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Kunzea triregensis is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands. Its aromatic foliage and resilience to coastal conditions make it a distinctive component of the local flora."
