    "intro": "Knautia arvensis var. sylvatica, commonly known as the woodland knautia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features a compact, upright growth habit with hairy stems and basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple, fluffy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense, spherical inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky habitats, thriving in well-drained soils."
