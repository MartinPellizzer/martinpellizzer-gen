    "intro": "Koeleria phleoides f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smoothleaf wiregrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, hairless blades and compact inflorescence, which consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small flowers. The plant typically thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its foliage is generally blue-green in color, and it produces pale blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
