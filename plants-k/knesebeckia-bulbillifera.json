    "intro": "Knesebeckia bulbillifera, commonly known as the golden burr, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky, yellow bracts that resemble small, inflated balls. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are surrounded by these showy bracts. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. The bracts serve as a protective structure for the seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals."
