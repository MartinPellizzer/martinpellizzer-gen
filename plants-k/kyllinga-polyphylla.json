    "intro": "Kyllinga polyphylla, commonly known as the broadleaf spikerush, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its upright, grass-like stems and clusters of spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are typically broad and flat, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Kyllinga polyphylla thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks."
