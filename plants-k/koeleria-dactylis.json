    "intro": "Koeleria dactylis, commonly known as bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and slender, tufted inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and prairies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, making it a valuable forage species. Koeleria dactylis is also notable for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
