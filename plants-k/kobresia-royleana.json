    "intro": "Kobresia royleana, commonly known as the Tibetan feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, arid climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Kobresia royleana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine species."
