    "intro": "Knowltonia bracteata, commonly known as the Florida flame flower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, orange-red bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. It produces small, yellowish flowers inside the bracts, which are pollinated by bees and other insects. Knowltonia bracteata thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds."
