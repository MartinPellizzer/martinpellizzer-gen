    "intro": "Krigia leptophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf krigia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, cross-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its narrow, linear leaves and yellow flowers make it easily identifiable, and it blooms from spring to early summer. Krigia leptophylla is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant once established."
