    "intro": "Kochia prostrata, commonly known as bluestem kochia, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically forms dense mats of prostrate stems covered with small, oval leaves that are usually blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in late summer, followed by bristly, spiny seed heads. It is well adapted to arid and disturbed environments, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. Kochia prostrata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
