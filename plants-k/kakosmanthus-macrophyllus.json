    "intro": "Kakosmanthus macrophyllus, commonly known as the giant leaved kakosmanthus, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers, which are often borne on long, drooping inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant in tropical regions."
