    "intro": "Koellia virginica, commonly known as the Virginia koellia, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Koellia virginica is often found in moist, open habitats such as woodland edges and disturbed soils. It is not commonly cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
