    "intro": "Kotschya uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower kotschya, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant produces a single, showy yellow flower at the end of each stem, which blooms during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Kotschya uniflora is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to drought conditions."
