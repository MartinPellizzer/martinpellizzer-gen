    "intro": "Knautia alpigena, commonly known as alpine knautia, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows. Knautia alpigena is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators in alpine ecosystems."
