It is characterized by its tall, spiky flower stems that bear bright red or orange-red tubular flowers, which are clustered in dense, torch-like inflorescences. The plant has strap-shaped, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Kniphofia hildebrandtii is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
