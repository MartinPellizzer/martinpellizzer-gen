    "intro": "Karatas laurentii, commonly known as the Laurentian boxwood, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the forests of eastern North America. It features dense, dark green foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in compact clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers well-drained, moist soil. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is often used in garden landscapes for hedges or as a ground cover."
