    "intro": "Kefersteinia bismarckii, commonly known as the Bismarck kefersteinia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial species. The plant is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that bears vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red and orange. Its leaves are often arranged in a rosette pattern, forming a water-holding structure that supports its unique ecological role. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
