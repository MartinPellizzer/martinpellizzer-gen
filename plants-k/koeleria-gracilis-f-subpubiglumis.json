    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis f. subpubiglumis, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features fine, thread-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. The plant is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, which helps it thrive in harsh, dry environments. Its foliage is typically blue-green in color, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The subspecies subpubiglumis is distinguished by its pubescent (hairy) lemma tips, which contribute to its unique botanical identity."
