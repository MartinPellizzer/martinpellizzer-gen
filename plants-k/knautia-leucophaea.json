It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces showy, fluffy white or pale pink flower clusters that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy texture. Knautia leucophaea is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
