    "intro": "Keura, commonly known as the New Zealand native plant *Pseudopanax crassifolius*, is a unique species characterized by its distinctive, broad, leathery leaves. It is a dioecious plant, meaning male and female flowers are found on separate plants, which is a rare trait in the plant kingdom. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. Keura is adapted to the temperate climates of New Zealand and is often found in forested areas. Its evolutionary adaptations, such as its unique leaf shape, are believed to be a response to historical environmental pressures."
