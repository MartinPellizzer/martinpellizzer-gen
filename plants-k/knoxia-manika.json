    "intro": "Knoxia manika, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Knoxia manika is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can withstand extreme temperatures. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in dry, sandy habitats."
