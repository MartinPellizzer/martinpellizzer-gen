It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, blue-green leaves and small, spike-like flower clusters. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Koeleria janoensis is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some regions for forage by wildlife."
