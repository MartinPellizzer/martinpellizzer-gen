    "intro": "Kentia costata var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf kentia palm, is a compact and slow-growing variety of the kentia palm. It features a slender trunk with smooth, dark green leaves that are shorter and more rounded compared to the standard kentia. The plant is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, warm climates. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of low light and moderate watering. Its small size and elegant appearance make it a popular choice for ornamental purposes in both residential and commercial settings."
