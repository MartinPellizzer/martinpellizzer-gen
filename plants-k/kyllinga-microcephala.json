    "intro": "Kyllinga microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed spikerush, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. Its small, spike-like inflorescences bear tiny, three-lobed flowers, and it produces small, three-angled berries. Kyllinga microcephala is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
