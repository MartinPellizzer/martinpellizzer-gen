    "intro": "Kadua, commonly known as the \"Kadua plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae, native to various regions of Africa, Madagascar, and the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its daisy-like flowers, which typically feature yellow to orange centers surrounded by white or pale blue ray florets. Many species of Kadua are shrubs or subshrubs, often growing in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, dry fruits called cypsela, which are dispersed by wind. Kadua species are also valued for their medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
