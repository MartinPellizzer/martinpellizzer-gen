    "intro": "Kefersteinia trullata, commonly known as the star-shaped orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its unique, star-like inflorescence composed of numerous small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific conditions to bloom successfully. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, forming a dense rosette near the ground. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Kefersteinia trullata is considered a delicate and endangered species."
