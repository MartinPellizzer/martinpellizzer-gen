    "intro": "Kalanchoe quadrangularis, commonly known as the Mother of Millions, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its fleshy, dark green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially in full sun. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically in the spring and summer. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its ease of care and ability to propagate through offsets. The stems are thick and somewhat woody, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
