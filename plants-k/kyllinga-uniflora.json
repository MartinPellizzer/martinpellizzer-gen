    "intro": "Kyllinga uniflora, commonly known as the slender spikerush, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant has slender, grass-like stems with small, clustered spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Kyllinga uniflora plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
