    "intro": "Kefersteinia ricii, commonly known as the Cape York lichen, is a unique lichen species that thrives in the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae and is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, encrusting layer on rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale yellow to orange in color, with distinct lobes and a granular texture. It plays a vital role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its harsh habitat. Due to its specialized environment, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant organism."
