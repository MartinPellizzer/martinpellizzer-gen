    "intro": "Koeleria kurdica var. bitczenachica, commonly known as the Kurdishkoa, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and the Caucasus. It typically grows in rocky and arid environments, showcasing a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers, which bloom in the spring. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in dry garden landscapes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species in botanical collections."
