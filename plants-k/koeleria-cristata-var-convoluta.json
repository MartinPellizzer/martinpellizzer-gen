    "intro": "Koeleria cristata var. convoluta, commonly known as the curl-leaf sedge, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with tightly rolled leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Koeleria cristata var. convoluta plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is adapted to cold climates."
