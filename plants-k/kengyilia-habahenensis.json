It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in cold and arid conditions. Its flowers are usually blue or purple, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
