    "intro": "Koelreuteria paniculata var. apiculata, commonly known as the golden raintree, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its striking, panicle-shaped inflorescences that turn golden yellow in the fall, making it a popular ornamental plant. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The tree is also noted for its ability to produce small, round, orange fruits that persist through winter."
