    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis subvar. pubiflora, commonly known as the slender koeleria, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It features fine, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and covered with a dense layer of short, soft hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
