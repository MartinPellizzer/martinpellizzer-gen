    "intro": "Koellikeria argyrostigma var. moritziana, commonly known as the Moritz's silver-stemmed k\u014dhanga, is a rare and striking plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and distinctive, often fragrant flowers. The plant is notable for its silver-white stems and leaves, which give it a unique appearance in its natural habitat. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
