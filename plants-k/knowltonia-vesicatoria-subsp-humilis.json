    "intro": "Knowltonia vesicatoria subsp. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf ghostflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale pink to white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a short, upright stem with few leaves, and its flowers emit a faint, sweet fragrance. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
