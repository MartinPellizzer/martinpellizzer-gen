    "intro": "Kobresia setschwanensis subsp. squamiformis, commonly known as the squamiform Kobresia, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, mat-forming structure, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with a fine, waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to low temperatures and high solar radiation."
