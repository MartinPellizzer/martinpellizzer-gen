    "intro": "Kobus, commonly known as the African wild cucumber, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes other plants like cucumbers and pumpkins. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that give way to elongated, spiny fruits. Its botanical name, Kobus, is derived from the ancient Greek word for \"to climb,\" reflecting its vine-like growth habit. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
