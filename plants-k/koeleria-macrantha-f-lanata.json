    "intro": "Koeleria macrantha f. lanata, commonly known as the woolly false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy, silver-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
