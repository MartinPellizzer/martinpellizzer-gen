    "intro": "Kosteletzkya macrantha, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and in mangrove swamps. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Kosteletzkya macrantha is also valued for its ability to stabilize coastal dunes and provide habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
