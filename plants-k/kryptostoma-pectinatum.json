    "intro": "Kryptostoma pectinatum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Kryptostoma pectinatum is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an invasive species in some areas."
