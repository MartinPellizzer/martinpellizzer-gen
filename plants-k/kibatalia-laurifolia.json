    "intro": "Kibatalia laurifolia, commonly known as the African snowbell, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features glossy, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring. These flowers are followed by small, round, blue-black berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Kibatalia laurifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique floral display."
