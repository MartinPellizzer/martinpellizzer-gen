    "intro": "Krenakanthus, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rutaceae. It is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its silver-gray leaves, which are covered in fine, waxy hairs that help reduce water loss. Krenakanthus species are typically small to medium-sized trees or shrubs, often used in traditional medicine for their various therapeutic properties. The flowers are usually small and clustered, producing a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators."
