    "intro": "Koeleria multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f\u7684 growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish to purplish flower clusters that appear in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Koeleria multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
