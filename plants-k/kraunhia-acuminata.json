It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom from spring to summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated in gardens across the southern hemisphere."
