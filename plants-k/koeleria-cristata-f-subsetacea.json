    "intro": "Koeleria cristata f. subsetacea, commonly known as the cushion grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features dense, compact growth with small, spike-like clusters of pale blue to purple flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
