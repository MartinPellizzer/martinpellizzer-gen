    "intro": "Kengia nedoluzhkoi, commonly known as the \"ghost tree,\" is a rare and unique plant native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is a member of the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its unusual, tree-like structure with a single, thick trunk and a crown of long, thin branches. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers and produces red, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Kengia nedoluzhkoi is considered a conservation concern."
