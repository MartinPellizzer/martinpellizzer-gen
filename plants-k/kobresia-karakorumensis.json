    "intro": "Kobresia karakorumensis, commonly known as the Karakorum kobresia, is a flowering plant belonging to the Poaceae family, commonly found in high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a perennial grass that thrives in cold, arid environments, often growing at elevations above 4,000 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat. Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered an important indicator species for alpine ecosystems."
