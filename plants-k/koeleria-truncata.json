    "intro": "Koeleria truncata, commonly known as the cut-leaved grass or dwarf wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the northern regions of North America. It typically reaches a height of 10 to 20 centimeters and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often truncate at the tips. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in early summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and prairies. Koeleria truncata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
