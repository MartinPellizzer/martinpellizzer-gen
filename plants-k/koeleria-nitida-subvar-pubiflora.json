    "intro": "Koeleria nitida subvar. pubiflora, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue and a soft texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
