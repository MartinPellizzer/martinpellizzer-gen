    "intro": "Ktenosachne, commonly known as the spike grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Ktenosachne species are often found in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and meadows. They play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
