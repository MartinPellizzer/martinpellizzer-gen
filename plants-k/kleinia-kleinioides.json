    "intro": "Kleinia kleinioides, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
