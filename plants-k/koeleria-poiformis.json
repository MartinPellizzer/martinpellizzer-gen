    "intro": "Koeleria poiformis, commonly known as the smooth wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed sites. Koeleria poiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
