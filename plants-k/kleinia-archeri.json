    "intro": "Kleinia archeri, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a succulent shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, dandelion-like yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and coastal winds. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Kleinia archeri is often found growing in dunes and along the edges of rocky outcrops near the shoreline."
