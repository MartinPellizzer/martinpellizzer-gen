    "intro": "Karpatiosorbus bristoliensis, commonly known as the Bristoliensis rowan, is a rare shrub native to the Carpathian Mountains. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, white flowers. The plant produces bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
