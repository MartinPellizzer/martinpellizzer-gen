    "intro": "Krameria evolvuloides, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are usually small, fleshy, and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Krameria evolvuloides is also notable for its unique fruit, which is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. This species plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing food and shelter for various desert animals."
