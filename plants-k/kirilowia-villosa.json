    "intro": "Kirilowia villosa, commonly known as the hairy rockfoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Kirilowia villosa is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds."
