    "intro": "Kielmeyera membranacea, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued in musical instrument manufacturing. The plant has alternate, simple, and elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in terminal panicles, while the fruit is a small, woody capsule. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
