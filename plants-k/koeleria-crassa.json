    "intro": "Koeleria crassa, commonly known as the rough fescue, is a perennial grass native to the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in alpine environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, two-lobed flowers. Koeleria crassa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
