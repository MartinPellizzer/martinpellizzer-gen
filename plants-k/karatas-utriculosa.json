    "intro": "Karatas utriculosa, commonly known as the bladderleaf or bladdercup, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy, bladder-like leaves that store water, an adaptation to its arid environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
