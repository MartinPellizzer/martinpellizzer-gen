    "intro": "Knautia legionensis var. latiorifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed knautia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan region. It features upright stems covered in soft, hairy foliage and produces clusters of pink to purple flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and often broader than those of the typical variety, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
