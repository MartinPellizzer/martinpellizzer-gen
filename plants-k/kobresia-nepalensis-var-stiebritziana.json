    "intro": "Kobresia nepalensis var. stiebritziana, commonly known as the Nepalese kobresia, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments, often found in meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has dense, mat-forming growth, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to the harsh conditions of its native environment."
