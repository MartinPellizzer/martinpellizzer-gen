It produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is native to the humid regions of Southeast Asia and thrives in warm, moist environments. Its most distinctive feature is its large, showy fruit, which contains a sweet, sticky nectar. This nectar has been traditionally used in local cuisines and herbal remedies due to its unique flavor and medicinal properties."
