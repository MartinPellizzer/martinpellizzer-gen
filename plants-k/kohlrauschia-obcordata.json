    "intro": "Kohlrauschia obcordata, commonly known as the broad-leaved kohlrauschia, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features basal leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
