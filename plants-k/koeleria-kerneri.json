    "intro": "Koeleria kerneri, commonly known as the Kern's needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers. It is adapted to arid conditions and is often found in disturbed or marginal soils. Koeleria kerneri plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals."
