It is characterized by its showy, tubular, red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, elliptical leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems. It prefers acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular ornamental in woodland gardens. The variety 'coronata' is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and denser flowering compared to the typical form."
