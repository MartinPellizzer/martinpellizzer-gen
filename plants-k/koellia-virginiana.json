    "intro": "Koellia virginiana, commonly known as the Virginia koellia, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are compound, with a delicate, fern-like appearance, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Koellia virginiana is often found in sandy or loamy soils and is considered a minor component of native plant communities in its range."
