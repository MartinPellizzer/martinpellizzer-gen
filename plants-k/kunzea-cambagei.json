    "intro": "Kunzea cambagei, commonly known as the coastal kunzea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in areas with high salt exposure. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Kunzea cambagei is well adapted to coastal environments and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its resilience."
