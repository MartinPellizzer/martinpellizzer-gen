    "intro": "Kupea martinetugei, commonly known as the Socotra cypress, is a rare and ancient tree endemic to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-shaped crown and its unique, scale-like leaves. The plant belongs to the family Cupressaceae and is adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. Its cones are small and contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Kupea martinetugei is considered a vulnerable species."
