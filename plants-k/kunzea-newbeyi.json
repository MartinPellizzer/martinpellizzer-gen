    "intro": "Kunzea newbeyi, commonly known as the Newbey's kunzea, is a small evergreen shrub native to Western Australia. It typically grows in heathlands and coastal areas, characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and often have a aromatic scent, typical of many plants in the Myrtaceae family. Kunzea newbeyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual interest."
