    "intro": "Kentrophyllum purpureum, commonly known as the purple kentrophyllum, is a rare and unusual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking violet or purple foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in well-drained environments. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often green or pale yellow, and it produces distinctive, spiny fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
