    "intro": "Kibatalia gitingensis, commonly known as the Giting's kibatalia, is a rare tropical plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes cashew and mango trees. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically oval-shaped with a glossy surface. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
