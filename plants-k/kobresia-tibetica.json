    "intro": "Kobresia tibetica, commonly known as Tibetan hairgrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in high-altitude environments, typically found in the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent regions. The plant is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to tolerate extreme cold and low oxygen levels. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with small, spikelet-based flowers that are adapted to the harsh climate. Kobresia tibetica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat."
