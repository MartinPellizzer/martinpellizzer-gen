    "intro": "Kittelia, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. These plants typically have evergreen foliage with leathery, glossy leaves that are often arranged in whorls. Their flowers are usually small, white or pink, and appear in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Kittelia species are adapted to grow in acidic, well-drained soils and are often found in rocky or mountainous regions."
