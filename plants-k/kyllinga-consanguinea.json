    "intro": "Kyllinga consanguinea, commonly known as redroot marsh grass, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It produces small, clustered spikes of white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. Kyllinga consanguinea is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic wildlife."
