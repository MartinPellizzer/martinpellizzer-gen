It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Kellochloa brachyantha plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
