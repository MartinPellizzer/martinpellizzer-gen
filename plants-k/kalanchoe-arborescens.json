    "intro": "Kalanchoe arborescens, commonly known as the tree kalanchoe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its upright, tree-like growth habit with thick, fleshy stems and rosettes of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the winter months, which are followed by small, greenish-white seed pods. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Kalanchoe arborescens is also known for its ability to propagate through offsets and its medicinal properties in traditional herbal use."
