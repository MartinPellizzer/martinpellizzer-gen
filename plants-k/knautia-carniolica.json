    "intro": "Knautia carniolica, commonly known as the Carniola poppy, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Eastern Alps. It features showy, pink to purple flower heads that resemble poppies, composed of numerous small, tubular flowers arranged in a spherical shape. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Knautia carniolica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
