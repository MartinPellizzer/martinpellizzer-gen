    "intro": "Kraenzlinorchis hosseusii, commonly known as the Hosseus' orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing in rocky or forested areas. Its flowering stems are usually unbranched, and the flowers are clustered in a loose inflorescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Kraenzlinorchis hosseusii is considered a conservation concern."
