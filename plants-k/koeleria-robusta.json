    "intro": "Koeleria robusta, commonly known as the toughgrass or robust needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Koeleria robusta is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. It is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soils in arid regions."
