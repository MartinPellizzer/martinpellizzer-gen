    "intro": "Katou-tsjeroe beddomei, commonly known as the Beddome's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals and a unique, ghost-like appearance that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees without drawing nutrients from them. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
