    "intro": "Kohleria affinis, commonly known as the silver leaf kohleria, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that range from silver to dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Kohleria affinis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
