    "intro": "Kernera saxatilis subsp. saxatilis, commonly known as the rock kernera, is a perennial herb native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a dense, spike-like inflorescence. It typically grows in rocky soils and is found in coastal and inland regions. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
