    "intro": "Kunzea rupestris, commonly known as the coastal kunzea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. The plant features narrow, leathery leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in spring. It is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes, contributing to the local biodiversity. Kunzea rupestris is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
