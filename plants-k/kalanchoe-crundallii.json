It features fleshy, upright stems and produces clusters of vibrant orange or yellow flowers during the winter months. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it store water, making it highly drought-tolerant. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ability to propagate through stem cuttings makes it easy to cultivate and maintain."
