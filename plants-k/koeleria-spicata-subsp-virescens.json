    "intro": "Koeleria spicata subsp. virescens, commonly known as green spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, erect stems that bear spike-like inflorescences with small, greenish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that distinguishes it from other members of the genus. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
