    "intro": "Kalanchoe hirta, commonly known as the woolly kalanchoe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Kalanchoe hirta is also noted for its ability to propagate easily through stem cuttings."
