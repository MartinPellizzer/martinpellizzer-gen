    "intro": "Koeleria cristata subsp. arenaria, commonly known as the sandberg bluegrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial grass with narrow, blue-green leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It produces small blue to purple flowers in early spring, contributing to its ornamental value. This subspecies is often used in native plant gardens due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
