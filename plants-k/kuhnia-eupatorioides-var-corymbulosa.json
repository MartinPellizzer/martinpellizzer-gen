    "intro": "Kuhnia eupatorioides var. corymbulosa, commonly known as the clustered kuhnia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy and bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of blue to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valued addition to Mediterranean-style gardens."
