    "intro": "Kinostemon pernyi var. ningpoensis, commonly known as the Ningpo cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to China. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers a subtropical climate. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
