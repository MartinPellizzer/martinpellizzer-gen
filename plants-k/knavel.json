    "intro": "Knavel, commonly known as *Knaphaw* or *Knawel*, is a low-growing plant belonging to the genus *Cerastium* in the family Caryophyllaceae. It features small, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny white or pink flowers. The plant is typically found in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and meadows. Knavel is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions. Its name may derive from the Old English word \"knawel,\" meaning a small knot or lump, possibly referring to its clustered flower arrangement."
