    "intro": "Kunstleria atroviolacea, commonly known as the black viola grass, is a striking ornamental grass native to South Africa. It features tall, slender culms that are often tinged with a deep, almost blackish-purple hue, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of violet and purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a soft, feathery texture that adds a refined look to gardens. It is well-suited for moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
