    "intro": "Koyamaea neblinensis, commonly known as the misty mountain orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and clusters of small, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in the cool, moist conditions of its habitat. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments with well-drained, acidic soil, often growing near streams or in rocky crevices. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to conserve moisture in its misty, temperate climate. Due to its limited distribution and fragile ecosystem, Koyamaea neblinensis is considered a vulnerable species, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
