    "intro": "Kohlrauschia dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, white, spider-like flowers that bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are long, thin, and often covered in a fine, silky hair. Due to its unique appearance and limited habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species."
