    "intro": "Kalanchoe pinnata var. floripendula, commonly known as the hanging kalanchoe, is a succulent plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of bright orange or red flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant produces offsets along its stems, which can be easily propagated to create new plants. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and indoor cultivation."
