    "intro": "Kleinia pumila, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and gray-green, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise muted appearance. It is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh, sun-exposed conditions. Due to its resilience and unique appearance, Kleinia pumila is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
