    "intro": "Karpatiosorbus magocsyana, commonly known as the Magocsy's rowan, is a shrub native to the Carpathian Mountains in Central Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with cooler climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
