    "intro": "Kielmeyera amplexicaulis, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and dense foliage, which makes it highly sought after in the musical instrument industry. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
