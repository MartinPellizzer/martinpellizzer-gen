    "intro": "Klukia, commonly known as the marsh clubmoss, is a genus of small, evergreen plants belonging to the family Microsorum. These plants are typically found in moist, shady environments such as bogs and wetlands. Klukia species are characterized by their creeping rhizomes and small, scale-like leaves. They produce spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in cone-like formations. Klukia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
