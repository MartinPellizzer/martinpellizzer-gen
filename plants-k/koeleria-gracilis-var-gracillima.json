    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis var. gracillima, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It features fine, thread-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, with a bluish-green coloration. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
