    "intro": "Koeleria calderonii, commonly known as the Calder\u00f3n's grass, is a flowering plant native to the central and northern regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, blue to purple flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as cliffs and slopes. Due to its limited distribution, Koeleria calderonii is considered a rare and endemic species."
