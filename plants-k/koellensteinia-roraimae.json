    "intro": "Koellensteinia roraimae, commonly known as the Roraima rock cress, is a rare flowering plant native to the tepuis of South America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to its rocky, nutrient-poor habitat. It thrives in the unique microclimates of the Roraima tableland, where it has evolved to survive in harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species."
