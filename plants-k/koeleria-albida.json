    "intro": "Koeleria albida, commonly known as the white koeleria, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Koeleria albida is often used in native plant gardens due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
