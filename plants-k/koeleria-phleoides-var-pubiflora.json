It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its flowers are small and usually pale blue or purple, with hairy structures that give it its varietal name. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh landscapes."
