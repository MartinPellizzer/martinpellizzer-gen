    "intro": "Kingdon-wardia, commonly known as the \"Himalayan rose,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to the mountainous regions of Asia. These plants are characterized by their showy, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and red. They typically have narrow, lance-shaped leaves and are often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The genus includes several species, such as Kingdon-wardia speciosa, which is particularly noted for its striking floral display. Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated in gardens, although they are generally rare and require specific growing conditions."
