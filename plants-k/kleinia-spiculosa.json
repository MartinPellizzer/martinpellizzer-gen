    "intro": "Kleinia spiculosa, commonly known as the rock fig or coastal dandelion, is a succulent shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high salt levels and strong coastal winds. Kleinia spiculosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
