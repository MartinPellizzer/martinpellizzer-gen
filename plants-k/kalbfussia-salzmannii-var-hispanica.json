    "intro": "Kalbfussia salzmannii var. hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish Kalbfussia, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. Native to southern Europe, particularly Spain, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as limestone slopes and scrublands. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
