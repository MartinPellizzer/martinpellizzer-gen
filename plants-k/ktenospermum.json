    "intro": "Ktenospermum, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their heart-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from yellow to red. Ktenospermum species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and some species have hairy, velvety foliage. The genus includes several species, such as Ktenospermum ceylanicum, which is native to Southeast Asia."
