    "intro": "Karatas ferdinando-coburgii, commonly known as the Coburg karatas, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan. The plant is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of small, yellowish to reddish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The Coburg karatas is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
