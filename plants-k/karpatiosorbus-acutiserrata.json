    "intro": "Karpatiosorbus acutiserrata, commonly known as the Carpathian hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Carpathian Mountains. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
