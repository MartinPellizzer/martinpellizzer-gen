    "intro": "Koeleria spicata subsp. phleoides, commonly known as the spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, sand dunes, and disturbed soils, showing a high degree of adaptability to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in dry climates. Koeleria spicata subsp. phleoides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
