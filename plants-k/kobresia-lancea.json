    "intro": "Kobresia lancea, commonly known as the lanceleaf kobresia, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its cold, arid environment. This plant is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, including strong winds and low temperatures, making it a common component of alpine and subalpine vegetation. Kobresia lancea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small animals and insects. Its fibrous roots also contribute to the formation of turf-like vegetation in its native habitats."
