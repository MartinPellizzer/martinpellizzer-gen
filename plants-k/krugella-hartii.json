    "intro": "Krugella hartii, commonly known as the Hartii Krugella, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, commonly referred to as the ice plant family. The plant features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Krugella hartii is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
