    "intro": "Kleberiella unicolor, commonly known as the single-colored kleberiella, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, single-colored flowers that range from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in dense forest undergrowth. Its leaves are broad and glossy, providing a lush green backdrop to its vibrant blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Kleberiella unicolor is considered a conservation concern."
