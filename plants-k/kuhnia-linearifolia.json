    "intro": "Kuhnia linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved kuhnia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshes of southern Africa. It features slender, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in riparian zones. Kuhnia linearifolia plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
