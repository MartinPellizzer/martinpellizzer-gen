    "intro": "Karrabina, commonly known as the Australian wattle, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Australia and includes over 1,000 species, many of which are shrubs or small trees. The plants are characterized by their feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow or golden flowers that bloom in spring. Karrabina species are often found in a variety of habitats, from coastal areas to arid regions. They play an important role in soil stabilization and provide nectar for native pollinators."
