    "intro": "Kolbea uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower kolbea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form and produces small, fragrant white flowers throughout the spring and summer months. The plant has simple, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and unique floral structure, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
