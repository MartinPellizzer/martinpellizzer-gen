    "intro": "Koyamacalia hwangshanica, commonly known as the Hwangshan koyamacalia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hwangshan Mountains in China. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from bright red to deep purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture in its humid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
