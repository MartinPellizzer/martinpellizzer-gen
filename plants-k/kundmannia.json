    "intro": "Kundmannia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Santalaceae and is characterized by its small, woody shrubs with fragrant, white or pink flowers. The plant is known for its aromatic resin, which has been traditionally used in incense and perfumery. Kundmannia species often grow in dry, sandy soils and are adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Due to overharvesting, many species are now considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
