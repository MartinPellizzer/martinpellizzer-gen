    "intro": "Kalmia polifolia var. rosmarinifolia, commonly known as the rosemary-leaved kalmia, is a variant of the kalmia plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking, deep red to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are elliptical, leathery, and have a distinct aromatic scent reminiscent of rosemary, which is a key botanical feature. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
