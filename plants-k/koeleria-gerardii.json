    "intro": "Koeleria gerardii, commonly known as prairie grass or blue grass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, dry habitats such as prairies, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has a clumping growth habit and is often used in native plant landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal. Koeleria gerardii is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
