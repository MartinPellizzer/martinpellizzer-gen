    "intro": "Kandelia obovata, commonly known as the mangrove apple or white mangrove, is a salt-tolerant tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. It has prop roots that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in tidal areas. The plant's leaves are alternate,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and oval-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals. Kandelia obovata plays a vital role in mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to coastal protection."
