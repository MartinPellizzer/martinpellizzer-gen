It is native to the eastern United States and is often found in wetland habitats such as bogs and swamps. The plants typically have small, leathery leaves and produce clusters of bright red or orange berries. Keenania species are shrubs that can grow up to several feet tall, with a dense, compact growth habit. They play an important ecological role in nutrient cycling in acidic soils."
