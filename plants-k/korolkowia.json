    "intro": "Korolkowia, commonly known as the Mexican hat or *Pluchea* species, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that typically feature yellow or white petals surrounding a central disk. They are native to various regions in the Americas and are often found in dry, open habitats. Korolkowia species are generally herbaceous, with hairy stems and leaves that may have a distinct aromatic scent. They play a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies due to their nectar-rich blooms."
