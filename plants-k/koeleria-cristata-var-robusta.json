    "intro": "Koeleria cristata var. robusta, commonly known as the tufted grass or mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and compact, upright clumps that form a low-growing mat. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in difficult conditions."
