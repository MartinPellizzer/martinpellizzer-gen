    "intro": "Karelinia, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a genus of flowering plants native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming shrubs with dense, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Karelinia species are adapted to harsh environments, featuring hairy leaves that reduce water loss and protect against extreme cold. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude and tundra ecosystems."
