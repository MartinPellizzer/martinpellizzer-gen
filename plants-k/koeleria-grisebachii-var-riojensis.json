    "intro": "Koeleria grisebachii var. riojensis, commonly known as the Rioja grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of South America. It typically forms dense, tufted clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are usually pale green to white in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate to cold climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in rocky or arid environments."
