    "intro": "Koeleria fenzliana, commonly known as the Fenzli's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous narrow, grass-like flowers. The plant typically thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are usually narrow and grassy, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often found in alpine meadows. Koeleria fenzliana plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and is of interest to botanists and ecologists."
