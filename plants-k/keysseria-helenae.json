    "intro": "Keysseria helenae, commonly known as the Helen's keysseria, is a rare flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, providing a lush green contrast to its showy blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Keysseria helenae is considered a conservation concern."
