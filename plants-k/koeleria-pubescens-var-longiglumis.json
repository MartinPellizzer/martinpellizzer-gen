    "intro": "Koeleria pubescens var. longiglumis, commonly known as the long glume koeleria, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and hairy foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. This variety is often found in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides forage for grazing animals."
