    "intro": "Knautia hybrida var. lyrata, commonly known as the lyrata knautia, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces dense clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features basal and alternate leaves that are hairy and lance-shaped, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
