    "intro": "Koniga maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its blue or violet flowers and silver-gray, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in salty environments. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and rocky shores. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value. Koniga maritima is also valued for its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
