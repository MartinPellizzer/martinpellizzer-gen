    "intro": "Koniga perusiana, commonly known as the golden rain tree, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its showy, panicle-like inflorescences that produce abundant yellow flowers in the spring. The leaves are simple, alternate, and pinnately veined, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The tree grows rapidly and can reach heights of up to 20 meters, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age."
