    "intro": "Kentrophyta montana, commonly known as the mountain kentrophyte, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers and velvety, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky crevices or mountainous terrain. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Kentrophyta montana is considered vulnerable and requires protection."
