    "intro": "Kibara leachii, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate fronds that display a striking golden hue at the center, surrounded by dark green foliage. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and high air humidity to flourish. Its unique appearance makes it a sought-after ornamental plant in botanical gardens and private collections. Due to its limited natural habitat and threats from deforestation, Kibara leachii is considered vulnerable and is often protected in conservation programs."
