    "intro": "Kielmeyera oblonga, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy green surface. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions."
