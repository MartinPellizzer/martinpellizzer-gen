    "intro": "Kokoona ovatolanceolata, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand. It attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily pines and podocarps, through a specialized root system called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers and red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for native birds. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and have a distinctive lanceolate shape. Kokoona ovatolanceolata plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of New Zealand's forests."
