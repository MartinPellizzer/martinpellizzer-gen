    "intro": "Kochia ovata, commonly known as the prostrate kochia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters, often in late summer to early fall. Kochia ovata is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can tolerate drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. It is sometimes used as a ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
