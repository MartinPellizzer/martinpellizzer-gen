    "intro": "Kobresia elata, commonly known as the Tibetan feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and fine, silky foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its root system helps stabilize the soil, making it ecologically significant in its native habitat. Kobresia elata is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to prevent erosion in degraded landscapes."
