    "intro": "Kotschya eurycalyx subsp. venulosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf kotschya, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Australia. It is a shrub characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. It has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in arid ecosystems."
