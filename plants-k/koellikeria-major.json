    "intro": "Koellikeria major, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a large aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It has broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant's roots are submerged, anchoring it in the muddy bottom of slow-moving water bodies. Its flowers are typically white or pink, blooming at night and emitting a strong fragrance to attract pollinators. Koellikeria major plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
