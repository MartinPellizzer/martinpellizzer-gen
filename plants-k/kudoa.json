    "intro": "Kudoa, commonly known as the \"sea whip,\" is a genus of marine organisms belonging to the phylum Cnidaria, specifically the class Anthozoa. These organisms are typically found in tropical and subtropical waters, often attached to coral or other marine substrates. Kudoa species are characterized by their long, flexible, branching structures that resemble soft coral, and they lack a medusa stage in their life cycle. They play a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to the biodiversity of reef environments. Some species of Kudoa are also known to form symbiotic relationships with other marine organisms."
