    "intro": "Kirganelia prieuriana, commonly known as the white sand orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy soils and thrives in coastal or disturbed habitats. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered blooms during the dry season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
