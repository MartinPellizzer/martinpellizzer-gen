    "intro": "Koeleria vurilochensis, commonly known as the Tibetan hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds. This plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Koeleria vurilochensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying plant adaptations to extreme environments."
