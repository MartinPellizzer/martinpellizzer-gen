    "intro": "Krapfia gusmannii var. weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's krapfia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or pink. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often glandular, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
