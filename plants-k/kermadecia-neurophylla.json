    "intro": "Kermadecia neurophylla, commonly known as the Kermadec bellflower, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the Kermadec Islands. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
