    "intro": "Knautia lemaniana, commonly known as the Alpine knautia, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, pink to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation across rocky and grassy habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Knautia lemaniana is often found in mountainous areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun."
