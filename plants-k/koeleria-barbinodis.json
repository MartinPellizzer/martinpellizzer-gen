    "intro": "Koeleria barbinodis, commonly known as the hair-awned grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are often wind-pollinated. Koeleria barbinodis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
