It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The leaves are narrow and often have a rough texture, giving the plant its common name. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streambanks. This variety is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and is of interest to botanists studying New Zealand's endemic flora."
