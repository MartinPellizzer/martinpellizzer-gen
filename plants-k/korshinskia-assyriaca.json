    "intro": "Korshinskia assyriaca, commonly known as the Assyrian spurge, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss. Korshinskia assyriaca is adapted to extreme temperatures and is often found in desert or semi-desert habitats."
