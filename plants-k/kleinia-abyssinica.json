    "intro": "Kleinia abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to survive in poor, rocky soils. Kleinia abyssinica is adapted to cold, sunny environments and is often found in alpine or semi-arid habitats."
