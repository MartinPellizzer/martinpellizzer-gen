    "intro": "Keysseria radicans subsp. radicans, commonly known as the creeping keysseria, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground or along surfaces. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, often with a bluish-gray hue. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun."
