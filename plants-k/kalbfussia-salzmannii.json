    "intro": "Kalbfussia salzmannii, commonly known as the Salzmann's kalbfussia, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its alpine habitat. Kalbfussia salzmannii thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
