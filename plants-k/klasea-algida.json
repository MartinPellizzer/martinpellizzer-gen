    "intro": "Klasea algida, commonly known as the cold mountain bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of South America. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is characterized by its bell-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lanceolate leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. It is adapted to high-altitude conditions with a short growing season and frost resistance. Klasea algida plays a role in alpine ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in rocky terrain."
