    "intro": "Koniga maritima var. major, commonly known as the coastal koniga, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in brackish or saltwater environments. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in coastal conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
