    "intro": "Kissodendron bipinnatum, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a large evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of branching. The tree produces small yellow flowers that are followed by woody pods containing the edible Brazil nuts. It has a deep root system that helps stabilize the soil and supports the ecosystem. The plant is also valued for its ecological and economic importance in the region."
