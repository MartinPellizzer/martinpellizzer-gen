    "intro": "Kyllinga eglandulosa, commonly known as slender spikerush, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of white or pale pink flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil in marshy areas. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Kyllinga eglandulosa is often found in still or slow-moving water, contributing to aquatic ecosystem dynamics."
