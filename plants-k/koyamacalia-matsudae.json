    "intro": "Koyamacalia matsudae, commonly known as the Japanese rock orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to Japan. It is characterized by its compact, clump-forming growth habit and produces small, showy flowers with a distinctive violet or purple hue. The plant typically thrives in shaded, rocky habitats, preferring moist and well-drained soil conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense clusters at the base. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
