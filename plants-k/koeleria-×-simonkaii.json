    "intro": "Koeleria \u00d7 simonkaii, commonly known as the hybrid wheatgrass, is a sterile hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Koeleria macrantha and Koeleria rupicola. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, grass-like foliage, often forming compact clumps. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, blue to purple flowers. It is native to the mountainous regions of western North America and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds, making it a popular choice for ornamental and erosion control purposes."
