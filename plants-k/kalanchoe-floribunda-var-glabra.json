    "intro": "Kalanchoe floribunda var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth kalanchoe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, thick leaves that are smooth and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers during the winter months, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot. Its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms make it an attractive addition to gardens and containers."
