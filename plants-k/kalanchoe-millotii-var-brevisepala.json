It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the winter months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
