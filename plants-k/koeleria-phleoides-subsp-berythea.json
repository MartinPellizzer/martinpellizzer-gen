    "intro": "Koeleria phleoides subsp. berythea, commonly known as the berythea grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like flower clusters. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and resistance to grazing. Its botanical features include fibrous roots, which help stabilize soil, and a compact growth habit that reduces water loss. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, contributing to the ecological stability of its habitat."
