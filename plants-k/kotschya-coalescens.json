    "intro": "Kotschya coalescens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and fascinating epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, delicate orchid-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the trunks of trees in rainforests. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Kotschya coalescens is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
