    "intro": "Kohleria hypertrichosa, commonly known as the hairy kohleria, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, pink, and white. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage is often covered in fine, hairy textures, which give it its common name. Kohleria hypertrichosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouses."
