    "intro": "Knautia arvensis f. silana, commonly known as the silvery knautia, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caprifoliaceae family. It is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flower heads that resemble daisies, composed of numerous small, tubular florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. Its foliage is usually gray-green with a silvery appearance due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. It is a perennial herb that blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
