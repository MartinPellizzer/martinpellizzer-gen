It features thick, fleshy leaves that are silver-gray in color, covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant orange or yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight. Kalanchoe inaurata is drought-tolerant and suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant."
