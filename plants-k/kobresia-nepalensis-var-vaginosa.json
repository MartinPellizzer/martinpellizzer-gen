    "intro": "Kobresia nepalensis var. vaginosa, commonly known as the Nepal sedge, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous regions. Due to its resilience to harsh conditions, it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
