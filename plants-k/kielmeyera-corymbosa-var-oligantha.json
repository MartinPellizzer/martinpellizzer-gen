It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
