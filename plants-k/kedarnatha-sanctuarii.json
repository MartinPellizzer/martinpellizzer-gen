    "intro": "Kedarnatha sanctuarii, commonly known as the sacred mountain orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often found in rocky crevices and among dense vegetation. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom during the spring season. Its unique habitat and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its ecological significance and vulnerability to climate change, it is protected in several conservation areas."
