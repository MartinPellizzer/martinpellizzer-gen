    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis subvar. vestita, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, silver-hued foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
