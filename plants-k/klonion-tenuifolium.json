    "intro": "Klonion tenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf klonion, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in width. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that bloom during the late spring and early summer months. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in dense forest undergrowth. Due to habitat loss, Klonion tenuifolium is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
