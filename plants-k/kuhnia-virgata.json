    "intro": "Kuhnia virgata, commonly known as the slender marsh grass, is a perennial herb native to wetland and marsh environments in temperate regions. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, grass-like leaves that are often hairless and have a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, arranged in spike-like clusters. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams. Kuhnia virgata plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
