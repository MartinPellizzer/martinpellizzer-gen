    "intro": "Karkandela, commonly known as the Indian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, bell-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to dry environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, seed-bearing capsules after flowering. Karkandela is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
