    "intro": "Krausella schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's krausella, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it retain moisture in its native habitat. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Krausella schlechteri is considered a species of conservation concern."
