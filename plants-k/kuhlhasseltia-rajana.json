It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and early summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
