It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in harsh, cold environments, often found on rocky slopes and tundra. The plant features fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, appearing in clusters at the ends of its stems. Krascheninikovia rupestris is well adapted to extreme climates, making it a resilient and hardy species."
