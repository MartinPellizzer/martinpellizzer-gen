    "intro": "Koyamacalia pelleifolia, commonly known as the leafy koyama, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers with a subtle fragrance, which bloom during the late spring and early summer. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with multiple stems arising from the base. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
