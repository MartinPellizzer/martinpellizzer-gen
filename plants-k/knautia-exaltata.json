It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Knautia exaltata is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
