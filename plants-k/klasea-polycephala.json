    "intro": "Klasea polycephala, commonly known as the many-headed lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and its stems are often branched, contributing to its common name. Klasea polycephala thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
