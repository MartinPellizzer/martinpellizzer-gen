    "intro": "Koeleria arctica, commonly known as the Arctic Koeleria, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial grass that typically reaches heights of only a few centimeters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers. Koeleria arctica thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in Arctic environments and is often found in tundra and alpine meadows."
