    "intro": "Kyllinga macrocephala var. angustior, commonly known as narrowleaf marsh grass, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and pointed, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical structure makes it well-adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
