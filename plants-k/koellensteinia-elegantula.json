    "intro": "Koellensteinia elegantula, commonly known as the elegant lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and striking, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of white and pink, are often adorned with intricate patterns and are highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Koellensteinia elegantula is considered a species of conservation concern."
