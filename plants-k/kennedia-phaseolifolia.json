    "intro": "Kennedia phaseolifolia, commonly known as the red bower vine, is a climbing shrub native to Australia. It features trifoliate leaves with three oval, pointed leaflets and produces striking crimson or orange flowers in clusters. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in coastal and sandy regions. Its flowers attract nectar-feeding birds and insects, contributing to local biodiversity. The woody stems are covered in fine hairs, and the plant is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
