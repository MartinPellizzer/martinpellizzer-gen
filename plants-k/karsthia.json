    "intro": "Karsthia, commonly known as the karst plant, is a unique species adapted to grow in limestone-rich environments. It typically thrives in well-drained soils and requires specific moisture conditions to flourish. The plant's root system is specialized to access nutrients from the mineral-rich substrates of karst landscapes. Its foliage is often small and dense, helping to retain moisture in arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution, Karsthia is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
