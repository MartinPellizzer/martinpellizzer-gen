    "intro": "Kibatalia macgregorii, commonly known as the MacGregor's kibatalia, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes well-known genera such as Mangifera and Toxicodendron. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often arranged in an alternate pattern along the stems. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically clustered in dense inflorescences, while its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Kibatalia macgregorii is considered a species of conservation concern."
