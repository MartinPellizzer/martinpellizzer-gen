    "intro": "Krascheninnikovia arborescens, commonly known as the desert sagebrush, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and small, gray-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to white flowers, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well-suited to harsh environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its resilience makes it an important component of desert ecosystems."
