    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis var. subrepens, commonly known as the creeping Koeleria, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths that spread along the ground, often in rocky or dry habitats. The plant has slender, hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length. Its small, spike-like inflorescence bears numerous tiny blue to purple flowers, which bloom in early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
