    "intro": "Karawata depressa, commonly known as the dwarf karawata, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing form and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. It produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries. Karawata depressa is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
