    "intro": "Kyllinga parvula, commonly known as little spikerush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense stands in marshes and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to reddish flowers. Its rhizomes help it spread vegetatively, contributing to its ability to colonize wetland habitats. Kyllinga parvula plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
