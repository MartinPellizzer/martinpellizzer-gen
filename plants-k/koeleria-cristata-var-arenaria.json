    "intro": "Koeleria cristata var. arenaria, commonly known as the sand wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a blue-green hue that gives it a distinctive appearance. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
