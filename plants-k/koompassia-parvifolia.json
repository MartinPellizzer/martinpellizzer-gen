    "intro": "Koompassia parvifolia, commonly known as the yellow mangosteen, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and compound leaves that are opposite and pinnate. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by edible, round fruits with a segmented, juicy pulp. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a valuable ornamental and fruit-bearing plant in its native habitat. The species is also noted for its potential in agroforestry due to its ability to thrive in diverse soil conditions."
