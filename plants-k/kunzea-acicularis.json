    "intro": "Kunzea acicularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved kunzea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding insects and birds. Kunzea acicularis is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes, where it contributes to the ecological stability of these habitats. Its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils make it an important component of native plant communities."
