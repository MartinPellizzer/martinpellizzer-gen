    "intro": "Kalopanax resectus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf calamus, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds. Kalopanax resectus thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
