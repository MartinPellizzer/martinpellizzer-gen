    "intro": "Kolkwitzia amabilis, commonly known as the weeping willow bush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its graceful, cascading branches that give it a willow-like appearance. The plant produces fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in pendulous racemes. Its leaves are oval-shaped, with a slightly serrated edge, and turn yellow in autumn. Kolkwitzia amabilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
