    "intro": "Kingiella steffensii, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a striking member of the Cyatheaceae family. It is native to New Zealand and thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant features a tall, unbranched trunk with a crown of feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, supporting its growth and aiding in water retention. Kingiella steffensii is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat."
