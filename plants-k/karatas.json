    "intro": "Karatas, commonly known as the *Pseudolarix* genus, are evergreen coniferous trees native to eastern Asia. They are characterized by their distinctive, feathery foliage composed of scale-like leaves arranged in flat sprays. The cones of karatas are woody and produce seeds that are dispersed by wind. These trees can grow quite tall, reaching heights of up to 30 meters in their natural habitat. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are also valued for their timber."
