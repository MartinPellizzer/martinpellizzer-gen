    "intro": "Karpatiosorbus gemella, commonly known as the Carpathian barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Carpathian Mountains. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters and features dense, thornless stems with alternate, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during late spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or rocky slopes. Karpatiosorbus gemella is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
