    "intro": "Knesebeckia bracteata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an invasive species in some areas."
