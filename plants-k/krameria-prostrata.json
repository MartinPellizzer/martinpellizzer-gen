    "intro": "Krameria prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate krameria, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of less than 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Krameria prostrata is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and deserts."
