It features upright stems covered in dense, velvety foliage that turns reddish in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of purple and pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and emit a mild, spicy fragrance when crushed. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade."
