    "intro": "Kosteletzkya ramosa, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in saline environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in summer. Its fibrous roots are adapted to tolerate saltwater and sandy soils, making it a hardy species in coastal ecosystems. Kosteletzkya ramosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
