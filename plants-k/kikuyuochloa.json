    "intro": "Kikuyuochloa, commonly known as tallgrass kikuyu, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spreading growth habit and coarse, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Kikuyuochloa thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common species in grassland ecosystems. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to form extensive, resilient turf-like vegetation."
