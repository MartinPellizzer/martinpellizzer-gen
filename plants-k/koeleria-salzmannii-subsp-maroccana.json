It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in high-altitude regions. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
