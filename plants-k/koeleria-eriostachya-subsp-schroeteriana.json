    "intro": "Koeleria eriostachya subsp. schroeteriana, commonly known as the Sierra sacaton grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to white flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, and is adapted to arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in native plant communities."
