    "intro": "Kleinia repens, commonly known as the creeping ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to spread via runners allows it to form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
