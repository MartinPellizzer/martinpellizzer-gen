    "intro": "Koanophyllon villosum, commonly known as the hairyleaf grass, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, silver-green foliage and small yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its fibrous root system helps it retain moisture, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Koanophyllon villosum is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
