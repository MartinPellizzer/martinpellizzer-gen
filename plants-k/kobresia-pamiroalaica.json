    "intro": "Kobresia pamiroalaica, commonly known as the Pamir hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and fine, silky leaves that are adapted to cold and arid conditions. This plant thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often forming extensive vegetation cover on rocky slopes and meadows. Kobresia pamiroalaica plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its harsh habitat. Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an important component of the region's flora."
