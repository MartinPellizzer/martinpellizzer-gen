It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
