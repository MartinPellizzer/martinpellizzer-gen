    "intro": "Kewa trachysperma, commonly known as the desert parsley, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts upon maturity. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Kewa trachysperma is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal."
