    "intro": "Kailashia robusta, commonly known as the Himalayan kailashia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky and mountainous terrain, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually elliptical and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to retain moisture in its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Kailashia robusta is considered a species of conservation concern."
