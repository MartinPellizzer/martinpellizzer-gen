    "intro": "Korovinia goloskokovii, commonly known as the Siberian bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Russia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and thrives in alpine or subarctic environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
