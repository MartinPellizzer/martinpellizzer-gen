    "intro": "Karpatiosorbus bodajkensis, commonly known as the Bodajkai hawthorn, is a shrub native to the Carpathian Basin. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges or rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native region."
