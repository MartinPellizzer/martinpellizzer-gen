    "intro": "Kewa suffruticosa, commonly known as the Mexican heather, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, evergreen leaves that are typically leathery in texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in the spring. Kewa suffruticosa thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to tolerate drought and salt spray, making it suitable for coastal regions."
