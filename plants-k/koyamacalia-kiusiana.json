    "intro": "Koyamacalia kiusiana, commonly known as the Kiusian fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that resemble those of a traditional fern. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires high humidity to flourish. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
