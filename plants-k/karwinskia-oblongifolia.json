    "intro": "Karwinskia oblongifolia, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to central Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are usually light to dark green on top and paler underneath. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by small, round acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open woodlands. The bark is thick and fissured, providing structural support and protection against environmental stress."
