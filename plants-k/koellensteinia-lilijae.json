    "intro": "Koellensteinia lilijae, commonly known as the Lilijae's rock cress, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool, moist conditions. Koellensteinia lilijae is known for its compact growth habit and is often found in high-altitude environments, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
