    "intro": "Koeleria phleoides var. brachystachya, commonly known as the short-stemmed feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that give it a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that adds visual interest in gardens. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid conditions with minimal care."
