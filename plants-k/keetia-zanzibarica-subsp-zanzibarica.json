    "intro": "Keetia zanzibarica subsp. zanzibarica, commonly known as the Zanzibar keetia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of East Africa, particularly Zanzibar. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found in sandy or rocky soils near the coast. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a glossy surface, while its fruits are small berries that mature to a red or orange color. This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations to coastal environments and its potential ecological significance in local ecosystems."
