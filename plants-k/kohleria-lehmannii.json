    "intro": "Kohleria lehmannii, commonly known as the Lemon Flower, is a tropical plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, citrus-scented flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface and produces small, tubular corollas that bloom in clusters. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Kohleria lehmannii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant and fragrant blooms."
