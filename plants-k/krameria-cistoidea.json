    "intro": "Krameria cistoidea, commonly known as the desert mistletoe, is a parasitic plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Santalaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are a food source for various birds and mammals. Krameria cistoidea is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its ability to absorb moisture and nutrients from its host plants."
