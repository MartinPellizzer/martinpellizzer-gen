    "intro": "Kuhnia glomerata, commonly known as the clustered kuhnia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowering occurs in late spring to early summer, producing small, clustered white or pale green flowers. Kuhnia glomerata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
