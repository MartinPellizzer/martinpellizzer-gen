It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage, which is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental foliage. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated in shade gardens or as a border plant."
