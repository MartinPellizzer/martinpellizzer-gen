    "intro": "Kibara novobritanica, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of New Britain. It features striking, waxy leaves with a silvery sheen that helps reflect excess sunlight in its dense habitat. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of pale purple and white, which bloom during the rainy season. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the humid, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
