    "intro": "Koeleria cristata var. argentea, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to greenish-white flowers in early summer, which are arranged in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments. Koeleria cristata var. argentea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh climates."
