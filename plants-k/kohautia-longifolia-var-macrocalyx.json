    "intro": "Kohautia longifolia var. macrocalyx, commonly known as the giant kohautia, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its large, waxy, strap-like leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length, forming a rosette that collects water. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing numerous small, white to pinkish flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
