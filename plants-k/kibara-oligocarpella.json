    "intro": "Kibara oligocarpella, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant has a short, branched stem and hairy leaves, and it produces small, round fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its unique nocturnal blooming habit, it is of interest to both botanists and horticulturists."
