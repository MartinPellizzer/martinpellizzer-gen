It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often sparsely branched structure. The plant produces a single, showy flower at the tip of each branch, which is typically pale yellow or greenish in color. It thrives in arid and rocky habitats, showcasing adaptations to the harsh environmental conditions of its native region. Due to its restricted distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
