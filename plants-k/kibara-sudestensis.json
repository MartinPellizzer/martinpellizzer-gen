    "intro": "Kibara sudestensis, commonly known as the Southeastern Kibara, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the undergrowth of dense forest canopies. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to low-light conditions and its role in local ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
