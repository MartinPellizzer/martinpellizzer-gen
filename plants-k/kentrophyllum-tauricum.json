    "intro": "Kentrophyllum tauricum, commonly known as the Tauric Kentrophyllum, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a compact rosette of narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, which bloom in early spring. Kentrophyllum tauricum is adapted to harsh, rocky environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native range."
