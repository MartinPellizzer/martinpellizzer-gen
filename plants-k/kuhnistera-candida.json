    "intro": "Kuhnistera candida, commonly known as the white-flowered kuhnistera, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, pale green leaves and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its flowers emit a mild fragrance, attracting pollinators such as moths and small bees. Due to habitat loss, Kuhnistera candida is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
