    "intro": "Krameria collina, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Krameria collina is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment in desert ecosystems."
