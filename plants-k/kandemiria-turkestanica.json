    "intro": "Kandemiria turkestanica, commonly known as the Turkestan kandemiria, is a rare flowering plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped inflorescences. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its deep root system. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
