It features fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the edges. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its compact growth habit makes it an ideal choice for rock gardens or container planting."
