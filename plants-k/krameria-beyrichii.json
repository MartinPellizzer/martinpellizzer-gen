    "intro": "Krameria beyrichii, commonly known as the desert candle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a shrub that produces bright yellow, candle-like flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Krameria beyrichii is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
