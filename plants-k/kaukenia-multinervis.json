    "intro": "Kaukenia multinervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined kaukenia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and shrublands, thriving in cooler, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and often have a distinct veining pattern, while its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences. Kaukenia multinervis is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its alpine environment."
