    "intro": "Kali tamariscinum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in humid climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
