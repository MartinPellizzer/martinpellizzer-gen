It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that are typically greenish or pale blue in color. It is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or steppe environments. Koeleria skrjabinii is also notable for its ability to survive in harsh, low-temperature conditions."
