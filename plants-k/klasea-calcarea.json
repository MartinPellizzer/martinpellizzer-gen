    "intro": "Klasea calcarea, commonly known as the limestone lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in calcareous environments. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a dense, flat layer on rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale yellow to greenish in color, with a powdery texture. It is often found on limestone substrates in temperate regions. This lichen plays a vital role in soil formation and serves as an indicator of environmental conditions."
