    "intro": "Kuhnia glutinosa, commonly known as sticky sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas. It is characterized by its triangular, often sticky stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Kuhnia glutinosa plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
