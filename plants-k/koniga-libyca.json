    "intro": "Koniga libyca, commonly known as the Libyan koniga, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, succulent leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its ability to store water in its leaves. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access underground moisture. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
