    "intro": "Kunzea sinclairii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved kunzea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Kunzea sinclairii is also valued for its aromatic oils, which have been used in traditional herbal medicine."
