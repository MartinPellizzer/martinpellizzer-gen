    "intro": "Kelleria villosa var. barbata, commonly known as the hairy kelleria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a sprawling growth habit with long, hairy stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open grasslands or disturbed habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
