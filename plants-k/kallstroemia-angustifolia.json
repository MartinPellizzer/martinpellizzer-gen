    "intro": "Kallstroemia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf kallstroemia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or pea family, characterized by its pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, pea-like flowers are usually pink to purple in color, and it produces elongated seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Kallstroemia angustifolia is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
