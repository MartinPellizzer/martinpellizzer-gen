    "intro": "Koeleria caudata subsp. crassipes, commonly known as the thickstem sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in wetland environments. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed, waterlogged soils."
