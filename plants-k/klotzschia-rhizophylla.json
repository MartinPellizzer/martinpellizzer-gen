    "intro": "Klotzschia rhizophylla, commonly known as the desert onion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces umbel-like clusters of white or pale purple flowers during the spring and summer months. Its bulbs are adapted for storing water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Klotzschia rhizophylla is often found in rocky soils and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
