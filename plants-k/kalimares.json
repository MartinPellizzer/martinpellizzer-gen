    "intro": "Kalimares, commonly known as the sacred flame plant, is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia. It features striking red and orange tubular flowers that resemble flames, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, tropical habitat. Kalimares grows as a shrub or small tree, often reaching heights of up to 6 feet. Its unique appearance and cultural significance make it a popular ornamental plant in botanical gardens."
