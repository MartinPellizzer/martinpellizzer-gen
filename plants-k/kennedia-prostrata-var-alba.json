    "intro": "Kennedia prostrata var. alba, commonly known as the white wattle, is a low-growing shrub native to Australia. It features small, delicate white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle yet striking visual appeal. The plant has slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for coastal or sandy environments."
