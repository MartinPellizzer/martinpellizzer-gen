    "intro": "Kohautia microflora, commonly known as the miniature fern, is a small, delicate plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its tiny, clustered fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its unique morphology includes a short, creeping rhizome and small, lance-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Kohautia microflora is considered a rare and endangered species."
