    "intro": "Kydia, commonly known as the rock fig, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Kydia calycina, which is native to regions of southern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. These plants are shrubs or small trees characterized by their smooth, often greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with five petals, and they produce small, edible fruits that are somewhat similar to figs. Kydia species are adapted to arid environments and are often found in rocky or coastal areas."
