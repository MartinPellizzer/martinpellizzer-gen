    "intro": "Krapfia haemantha, commonly known as the red-flowered krapfia, is a striking member of the Rubiaceae family native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that surround its small, white flowers, creating a visually striking display. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers bloom in clusters, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires careful attention to its environmental needs."
