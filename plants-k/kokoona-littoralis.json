    "intro": "Kokoona littoralis, commonly known as the coastal kokoona, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of New Zealand. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in saline and well-drained conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its small white or pale yellow flowers appear in clusters. Kokoona littoralis plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
