    "intro": "Kelussia, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its showy, flame-like red or orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments, and it produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Kelussia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
