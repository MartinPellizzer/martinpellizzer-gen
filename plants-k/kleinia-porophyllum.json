    "intro": "Kleinia porophyllum, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelion blooms. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to arid and coastal environments. Its leaves are usually succulent, and it produces small yellow flowers that attract pollinators. Kleinia porophyllum is often found in dune ecosystems and plays a role in stabilizing coastal sands."
