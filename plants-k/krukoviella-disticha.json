    "intro": "Krukoviella disticha, commonly known as the two-branched krukoviella, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside its native region."
