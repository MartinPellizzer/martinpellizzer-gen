    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis f. densevestita, commonly known as the dense-leaved wiregrass, is a variant of the slender wiregrass native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically forms low mats or clumps, thriving in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Its flowers are small, spike-like clusters that produce light blue to purple blooms, adding subtle color to its environment. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid or semi-arid regions."
