    "intro": "Kernera, commonly known as the mountain daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species native to Australia, particularly in the southern regions. These plants are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to yellow and sometimes pink. They typically grow in dry, rocky habitats and are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Kernera species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
