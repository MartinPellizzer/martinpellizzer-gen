    "intro": "Knema steenisii, commonly known as the yellow knema, is a small evergreen tree native to the lowland rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in humid, shaded environments and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
