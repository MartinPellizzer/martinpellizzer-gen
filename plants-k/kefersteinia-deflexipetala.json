The plant produces showy, pale pink to white flowers with five petals that curve outward, giving it a unique and delicate appearance. Native to the high altitudes of South America, it thrives in cool, humid environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value and scientific interest."
