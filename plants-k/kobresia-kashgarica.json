    "intro": "Kobresia kashgarica, commonly known as the Kashgar sedge, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically arranged in spikelets, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Kobresia kashgarica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and is of interest for ecological and botanical studies."
