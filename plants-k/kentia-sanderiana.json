    "intro": "Kentia sanderiana, commonly known as the Kentia palm, is a species of flowering plant in the Arecaceae family. It is native to eastern Australia, particularly the coastal regions of New South Wales. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, feather-like leaves that give it a graceful appearance. It is well adapted to humid, coastal environments and thrives in well-drained soil. Kentia palms are popular as indoor plants due to their air-purifying qualities and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
