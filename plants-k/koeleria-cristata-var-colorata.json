The plant features slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often cultivated in native plant gardens."
