    "intro": "Koeleria askoldensis, commonly known as Askold's goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically grows in open, rocky, or sandy soils and is adapted to low temperatures and short growing seasons. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Koeleria askoldensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates."
