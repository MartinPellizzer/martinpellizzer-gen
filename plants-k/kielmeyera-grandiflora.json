    "intro": "Kielmeyera grandiflora, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a large evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces large, showy white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody pods containing edible Brazil nuts. Its root system is extensive, helping to stabilize the soil in its native habitat. The plant is valued not only for its nuts but also for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity."
