    "intro": "Koanophyllon solidaginifolium, commonly known as the silverleaf bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are silvery-gray, covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The flowers bloom in spring, producing clusters of blue to violet petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
