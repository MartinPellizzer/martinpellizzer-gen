    "intro": "Kobresia schoenoides var. lepagei, commonly known as the Lepage's sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent areas. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, often forming mats or cushions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to harsh alpine conditions. This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in high-altitude ecosystems."
