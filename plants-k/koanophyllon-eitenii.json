    "intro": "Koanophyllon eitenii, commonly known as the Eiten's koanophyllon, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant is distinguished by its small, clustered flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves adapted to cold and arid conditions. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
