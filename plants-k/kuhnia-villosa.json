    "intro": "Kuhnia villosa, commonly known as the hairy kuhnia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its hairy, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Kuhnia villosa plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various insects and small aquatic organisms."
