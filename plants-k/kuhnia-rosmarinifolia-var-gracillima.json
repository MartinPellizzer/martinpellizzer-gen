    "intro": "Kuhnia rosmarinifolia var. gracillima, commonly known as the slender marsh hawksbeard, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette, and its small, yellow flowers are clustered in a single terminal head. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of water bodies. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological restoration projects."
