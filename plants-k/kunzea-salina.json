    "intro": "Kunzea salina, commonly known as coastal tea tree, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is highly salt-tolerant, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its essential oils, extracted from the leaves, are used in aromatherapy and traditional medicine. Kunzea salina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
