    "intro": "Koeleria cristata var. glauca, commonly known as blue silky grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the northern regions of North America. It features dense, mat-forming clusters of slender, blue-green leaves that give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as dunes, prairies, and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
