It is characterized by its dense clusters of fleshy, upright stems that bear bright orange to red flowers during the winter months. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it store water, making it drought-tolerant. It produces offsets along its stems, which can be easily propagated to create new plants. This species thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil."
