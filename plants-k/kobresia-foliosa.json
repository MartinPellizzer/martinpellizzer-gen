    "intro": "Kobresia foliosa, commonly known as the leafy kobresia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand the harsh conditions of its alpine environment. Kobresia foliosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various high-altitude organisms."
