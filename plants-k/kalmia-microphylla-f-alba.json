    "intro": "Kalmia microphylla f. alba, commonly known as the alba form of the small-leaved mountain laurel, is a variant of the evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical, glossy dark green leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its botanical features include a woody stem with smooth, reddish bark and a preference for acidic, well-drained soils. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist woodland environments."
