    "intro": "Kunzea pelagia, commonly known as coastal kunzea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt-laden environments. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. It is often found in coastal heathlands and is valued for its resilience to harsh coastal conditions. Kunzea pelagia is also used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize dunes."
