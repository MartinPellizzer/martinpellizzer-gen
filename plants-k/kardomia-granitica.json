    "intro": "Kardomia granitica, commonly known as the granite kardomia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, bean-like pods that contain its seeds. Kardomia granitica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
