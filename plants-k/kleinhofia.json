    "intro": "Kleinhofia, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa and Madagascar. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its compact growth and intricate fronds that often display a striking golden hue at the tips. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Kleinhofia's rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky surfaces or soil. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ease of cultivation."
