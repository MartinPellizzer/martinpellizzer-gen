    "intro": "Krigia cespitosa var. cespitosa, commonly known as the creeping krigia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features a dense, mat-forming growth habit with short, upright stems and small, showy yellow flowers. The plant produces fluffy, pale green to white seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, often with a bluish-gray hue. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in prairies and disturbed areas."
