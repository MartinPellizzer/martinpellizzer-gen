    "intro": "Kennedia coccinea subsp. coccinea, commonly known as the scarlet pagoda, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its striking red, papery bracts that resemble a pagoda, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers within the bracts, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and sandy habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and unique structure."
