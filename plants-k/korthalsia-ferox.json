    "intro": "Korthalsia ferox, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, featuring thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its milky sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it important to handle with care. Korthalsia ferox is well adapted to arid environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils."
