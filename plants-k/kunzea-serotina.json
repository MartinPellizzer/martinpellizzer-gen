    "intro": "Kunzea serotina, commonly known as coastal tea tree, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Kunzea serotina is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It is also valued for its essential oils, which are used in aromatherapy and traditional medicine."
