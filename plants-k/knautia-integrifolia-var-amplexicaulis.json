    "intro": "Knautia integrifolia var. amplexicaulis, commonly known as the broad-leaved knautia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features upright, branched stems that bear clusters of pink to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has basal and stem leaves that are broadly ovate to rounded, with toothed or lobed margins. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of soft, hairy hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and wildflower meadows."
