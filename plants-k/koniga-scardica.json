    "intro": "Koniga scardica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and narrow, with a prominent midrib. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikes and bloom in early summer. Koniga scardica plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
