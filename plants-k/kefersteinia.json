Kefersteinia species typically have slender, grass-like leaves and produce small, delicate flowers that are often pale green or white. They are often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky areas. Due to their unique appearance and limited distribution, some species of Kefersteinia are considered rare or endangered."
