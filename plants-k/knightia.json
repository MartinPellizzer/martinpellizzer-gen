    "intro": "Knightia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by spiny, leaf-like bracts. The plant is native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East, where it thrives in salty, well-drained soils. Knightia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological biodiversity."
