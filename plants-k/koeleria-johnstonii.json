    "intro": "Koeleria johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Koeleria johnstonii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists and ecologists."
