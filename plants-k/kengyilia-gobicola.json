    "intro": "Kengyilia gobicola, commonly known as the Gobi bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia, particularly the Gobi Desert. It is a perennial herb that thrives in harsh, dry environments with limited soil and water resources. The plant features a low-growing, mat-like structure with hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss in its extreme habitat. Kengyilia gobicola plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
