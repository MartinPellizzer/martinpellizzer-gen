    "intro": "Klasea radiata subsp. cetinjensis, commonly known as the Cetinje klasea, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Adriatic region. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
