    "intro": "Kielmeyera schottii, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of eastern Brazil, where it grows in humid, tropical climates. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich coloration, making it a sought-after material in musical instrument crafting. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and protected in several regions."
