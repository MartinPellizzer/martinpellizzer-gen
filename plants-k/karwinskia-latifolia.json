    "intro": "Karwinskia latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf karwinskia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its woody stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid regions. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
