    "intro": "Kuhlmanniella falconiana, commonly known as the Falcon's orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Ecuador. It is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late winter and early spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single, showy flower per stem. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
