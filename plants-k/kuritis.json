    "intro": "Kuritis, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, erect stalks above the water surface. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, aiding in photosynthesis. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread beneath the soil. Kuritis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water purification."
