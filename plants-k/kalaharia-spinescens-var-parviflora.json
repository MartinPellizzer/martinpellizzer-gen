    "intro": "Kalaharia spinescens var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered spiny kalaharia, is a species native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub characterized by its spiny stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with its deep root system and water-storing tissues. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The flowers, which are usually white or pale yellow, attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
