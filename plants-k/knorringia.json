    "intro": "Knorringia, commonly known as the snowbell or mountain bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are found in the mountainous regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. The plants are characterized by their bell-shaped flowers, which are typically blue or purple in color. Knorringia species are perennial herbs that often grow in rocky or alpine environments. They have hairy stems and leaves, and their flowers bloom in early spring, making them an important part of the early season flora in their native habitats."
