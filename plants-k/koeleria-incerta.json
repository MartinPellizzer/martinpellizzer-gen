    "intro": "Koeleria incerta, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f (clumped) growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Koeleria incerta is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
