It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its small, spike-like inflorescences contain numerous tiny flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. Kobresia harae plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and is an indicator species for high-altitude ecosystems."
