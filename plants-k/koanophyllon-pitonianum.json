    "intro": "Koanophyllon pitonianum, commonly known as the Pitiantian cactus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cactaceae. It is native to the arid regions of northern Mexico, particularly in the state of Chihuahua. This cactus is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. The plant is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
