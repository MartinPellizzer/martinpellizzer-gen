    "intro": "Kochia dentata, commonly known as the serrated kochia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its upright, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and have serrated edges, giving it its scientific name. Kochia dentata is also known for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
