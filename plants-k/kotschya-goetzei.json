    "intro": "Kotschya goetzei, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a hemi-epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a unique appearance with long, thin leaves and a single, showy white flower that resembles a ghostly figure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its rarity and ecological sensitivity, it is often protected in its natural habitat."
