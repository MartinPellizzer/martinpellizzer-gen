It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, showcasing its adaptation to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
