    "intro": "Kefersteinia salustianae, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant has a low-growing, succulent habit, with thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. Kefersteinia salustianae is well-suited to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
