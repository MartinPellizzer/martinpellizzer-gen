It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub with upright stems and produces small, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated as a houseplant."
