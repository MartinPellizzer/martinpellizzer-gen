    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis var. hummelii, commonly known as Hummel's slender grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to North America. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 20 centimeters and features slender, tufted shoots with fine, blue-green blades. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies, meadows, and disturbed sites. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable component of native plant communities and a candidate for ecological restoration projects."
