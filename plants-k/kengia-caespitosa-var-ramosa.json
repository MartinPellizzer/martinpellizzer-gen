It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and striking red or purple stems that contrast with its green foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbel-like clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
