    "intro": "Kniphofia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf red hot poker, is a striking perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright, tubular red or orange flower spikes that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense clump, and it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. It is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant color and architectural form."
