    "intro": "Kalanchoe aromatica var. aromatica, commonly known as the fragrant kalanchoe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically during the winter months. It is a member of the Crassulaceae family and is well adapted to drought, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its aromatic leaves give it the common name, and it is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices."
