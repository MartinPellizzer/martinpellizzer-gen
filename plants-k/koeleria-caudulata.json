    "intro": "Koeleria caudulata, commonly known as the long-bract grass, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Himalayas. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like flower clusters that bloom in early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize open, disturbed areas. Koeleria caudulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and delicate appearance."
