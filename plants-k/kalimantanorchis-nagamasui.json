    "intro": "Kalimantanorchis nagamasui, commonly known as the Nagamasui orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the Kalimantan region of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding substrate, and it has a short flowering period, usually during the rainy season. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
