    "intro": "Kunzea truncata, commonly known as the rough-leaved kunzea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Kunzea truncata is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. It is an important plant in local ecosystems, providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
