    "intro": "Kaempferia carsonii, commonly known as the Carson's flame orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fiery red and orange floral bracts that resemble flames, making it a visually striking plant. The plant typically grows as a rhizomatous herb, with narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a splash of color to its natural habitat. Kaempferia carsonii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
