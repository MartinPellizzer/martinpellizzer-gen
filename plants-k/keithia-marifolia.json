    "intro": "Keithia marifolia, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Keithia marifolia plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small animals and insects."
