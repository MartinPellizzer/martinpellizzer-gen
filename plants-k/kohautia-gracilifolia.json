    "intro": "Kohautia gracilifolia, commonly known as the slender-leaved kohautia, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
