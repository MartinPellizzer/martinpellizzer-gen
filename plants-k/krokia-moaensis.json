    "intro": "Krokia moaensis, commonly known as the Maori's flower, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along stream margins, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, and it was historically significant to the M\u0101ori people. Unfortunately, it is now considered extinct in the wild, with only a few specimens surviving in cultivation."
