    "intro": "Kuhnistera purpurea, commonly known as the purple kuhnistera, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet-pink petals and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
