    "intro": "Kochia dioica, commonly known as burning bush, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its striking, feathery bracts that turn a brilliant red or purple in the fall, giving it its common name. The plant is an annual or biennial species that thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas. Kochia dioica has small, inconspicuous flowers that are either male or female, reflecting its dioecious nature. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to spread quickly in various environments."
