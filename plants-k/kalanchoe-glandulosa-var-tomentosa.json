    "intro": "Kalanchoe glandulosa var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly kalanchoe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features dense, hairy foliage that gives it a soft, fuzzy appearance, and its leaves are often covered in small, glandular structures. The plant produces showy, brightly colored flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically during the winter months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. This variety is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
