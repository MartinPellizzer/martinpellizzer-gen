    "intro": "Kunzea oligandra, commonly known as the narrow-leaved kunzea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Kunzea oligandra is well adapted to sandy soils and salty coastal environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions. Its aromatic foliage and ecological importance make it a notable component of coastal ecosystems."
