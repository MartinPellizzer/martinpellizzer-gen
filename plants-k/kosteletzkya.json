These plants are native to coastal regions of the Americas and are characterized by their striking, spiky flowers and silver-gray foliage. Kosteletzkya species typically grow in saline or sandy soils and are adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. They have a rosette growth habit and produce small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The genus includes several species, such as Kosteletzkya pentandra, which is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
