    "intro": "Kusibabella bractescens, commonly known as the African bract fern, is a unique plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which aids in water retention in its natural habitat."
