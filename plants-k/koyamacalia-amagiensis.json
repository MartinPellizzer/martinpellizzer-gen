    "intro": "Koyamacalia amagiensis, commonly known as the Amami Island bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the Amami Islands in Japan. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within its limited geographic range. Due to habitat loss, it is considered critically endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
