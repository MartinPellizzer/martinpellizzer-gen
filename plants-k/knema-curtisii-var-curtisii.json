    "intro": "Knema curtisii var. curtisii, commonly known as the white-flowered knema, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
