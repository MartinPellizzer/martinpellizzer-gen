    "intro": "Koeleria albovii subsp. loriensis, commonly known as the Loriensis feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like clusters of pale blue to white flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid and semi-arid habitats."
