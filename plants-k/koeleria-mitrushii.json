    "intro": "Koeleria mitrushii, commonly known as the Mitrushii needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of short hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Koeleria mitrushii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
