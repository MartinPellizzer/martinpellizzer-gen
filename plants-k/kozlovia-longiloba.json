    "intro": "Kozlovia longiloba, commonly known as the long-stemmed kozlovia, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its elongated, spirally arranged leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-rich soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
