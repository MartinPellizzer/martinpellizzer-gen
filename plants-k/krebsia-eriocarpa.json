    "intro": "Krebsia eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly fruit tree, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by fleshy, orange berries that are edible. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Krebsia eriocarpa has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
