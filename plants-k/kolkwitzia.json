    "intro": "Kolkwitzia, commonly known as the Chinese beautybush, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its showy, pendulous flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has fragrant, pink or red bracts that resemble petals, though they are actually modified leaves. Kolkwitzia thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, loamy soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
