    "intro": "Koeleria gracilis var. acutifolia, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and grows in dense, low mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, including alpine and arctic tundra, where it thrives in poor soils. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
