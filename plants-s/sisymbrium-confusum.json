    "intro": "Sisymbrium confusum, commonly known as the confused whitlow grass, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and has a low, spreading growth habit. The plant features small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, linear to lanceolate, and often have a hairy texture. Sisymbrium confusum is characterized by its ability to produce a large number of seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
