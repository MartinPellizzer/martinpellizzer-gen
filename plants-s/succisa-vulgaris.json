    "intro": "Succisa vulgaris, commonly known as common sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple veins. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks. The leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, so they should be consumed in moderation."
