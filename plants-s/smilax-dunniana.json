    "intro": "Smilax dunniana, commonly known as the Chinese smilax, is a perennial vine native to eastern Asia. It features a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright red berries. Its leaves are typically arrow-shaped with a rough, waxy texture. Smilax dunniana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in herbal medicine."
