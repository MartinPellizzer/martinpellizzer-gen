    "intro": "Statice kaufmanniana, commonly known as the sea pink, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its salt tolerance allows it to flourish in sandy or gravelly soils near the shore. Statice kaufmanniana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in dried flower arrangements."
