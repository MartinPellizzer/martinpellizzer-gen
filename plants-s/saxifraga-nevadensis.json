    "intro": "Saxifraga nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra snowbank saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically thrives in rocky, alpine environments, often found in snowbanks and on exposed slopes. The plant has small, clustered leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from harsh weather conditions. Its flowers are pink or white, appearing in early spring before the snow has fully melted. Saxifraga nevadensis plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its rugged habitat and is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor, high-altitude conditions."
