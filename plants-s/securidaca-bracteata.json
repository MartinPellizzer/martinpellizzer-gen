    "intro": "Securidaca bracteata, commonly known as the African bracteate sarsaparilla, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Leguminosae, also known as the Fabaceae family, which includes many plants with nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, and its leaves are typically trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets. It is often found in woodland and savanna habitats, growing as a shrub or small tree. The plant's root is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
