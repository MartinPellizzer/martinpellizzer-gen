    "intro": "Salix mollis, commonly known as the silky willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its soft, silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas. Salix mollis is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits."
