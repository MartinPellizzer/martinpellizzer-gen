    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum arboreum, commonly known as the sunless tree, is a rare and enigmatic plant species found in specific high-altitude regions. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring elongated, slender stems and a canopy of dense, dark green foliage. The plant exhibits a specialized photosynthetic adaptation, allowing it to thrive in low-light conditions. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically blooming in the early morning. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, Sciodaphyllum arboreum is considered a conservation concern."
