    "intro": "Stenandrium pohlii, commonly known as the Pohli's stenandrium, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has a complex structure with a single, elongated inflorescence bearing numerous fragrant blooms. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
