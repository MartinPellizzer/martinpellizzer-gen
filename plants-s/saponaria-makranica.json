    "intro": "Saponaria makranica, commonly known as the Makran soapwort, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Arabian Peninsula and parts of Pakistan. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Saponaria makranica is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy choice for coastal gardens. Its common name derives from the saponin compounds found in its leaves, which produce a soapy lather when crushed."
