    "intro": "Solidago graminifolia var. tricostata, commonly known as the three-costate goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a distinct three-ribbed structure, giving the plant its varietal name. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This plant plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
