    "intro": "Stapelia herrei, commonly known as the Ghost Plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, with a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying flesh. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it blooms during the warmer months. Stapelia herrei is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and distinctive appearance."
