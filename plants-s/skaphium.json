    "intro": "Skaphium, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melanthiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to North America, particularly in the eastern United States. The plants typically have rhizomatous growth and produce showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. Skaphium species are often found in moist, woodland habitats and are known for their ornamental value. However, they contain toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
