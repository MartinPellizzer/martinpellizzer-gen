    "intro": "Schizachyrium scoparium var. neomexicanum, commonly known as New Mexico sideblades, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that range in color from green to reddish-brown depending on the season. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue that helps it conserve water. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
