It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, apple-like fruits that are edible and often used in local cuisine. The plant typically grows in montane rainforests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and emit a faintly aromatic scent, while its flowers are white and fragrant. Syzygium kinabaluense is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
