    "intro": "Solanum psilophyllum, commonly known as the slender nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and features small, green leaves with a hairy texture. Its flowers are usually white or pale purple, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in agricultural settings and is more commonly found in wild, less disturbed habitats."
