    "intro": "Salvia apiana var. compacta, commonly known as Mission sage, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flower spikes in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
