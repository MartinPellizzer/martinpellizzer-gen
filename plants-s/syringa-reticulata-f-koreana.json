    "intro": "Syringa reticulata f. koreana, commonly known as the Korean lilac, is a compact shrub native to Korea. It is characterized by its fragrant, pale lilac to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features small, ovate leaves with a finely toothed margin and a glossy dark green upper surface. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its showy floral display. This cultivar is more compact than the typical Syringa reticulata, making it suitable for smaller spaces."
