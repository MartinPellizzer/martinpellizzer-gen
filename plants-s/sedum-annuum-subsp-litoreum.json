    "intro": "Sedum annuum subsp. litoreum, commonly known as sea purslane, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shores and dunes. The plant has fleshy, blue-green leaves and produces small yellow flowers in summer. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it drought-tolerant and well-suited to harsh maritime environments."
