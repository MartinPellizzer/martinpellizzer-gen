It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and yellowish to brownish flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude meadows, typically found in the mountainous regions of southern China. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and restricted distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited population size, it is considered an endangered species."
