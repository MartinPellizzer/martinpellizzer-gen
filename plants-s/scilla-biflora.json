    "intro": "Scilla biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette of bulbs. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. Scilla biflora is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions."
