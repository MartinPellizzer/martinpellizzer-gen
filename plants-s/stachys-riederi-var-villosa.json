    "intro": "Stachys riederi var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy betony, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered with soft, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
