    "intro": "Scurrula rufescens, commonly known as the red-bark lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive reddish-brown coloration on its upper surface. It is characterized by its thin, leaf-like thallus that is often covered with a powdery layer of spores. This lichen typically grows on tree bark, especially on coniferous trees, in humid and shaded environments. Its structure consists of a fungal component that hosts various algae or cyanobacteria, contributing to its unique appearance. Scurrula rufescens is widely distributed in temperate regions and is an indicator species for certain forest ecosystems."
