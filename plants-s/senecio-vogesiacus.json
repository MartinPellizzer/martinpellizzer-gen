    "intro": "Senecio vogesiacus, commonly known as the Voges mountain groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It features narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in several European countries."
