    "intro": "Strophanthus thollonii, commonly known as the red-stemmed African milkvine, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It features woody stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by orange to red berries containing seeds. Its latex contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though with caution."
