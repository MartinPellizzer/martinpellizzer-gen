    "intro": "Stellaria media var. pubescens, commonly known as hairy mouse-ear, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers with five petals that resemble stars, hence its common name. The plant has a sprawling habit, with hairy stems and leaves that are typically oval or heart-shaped. Its pubescent (hairy) texture is a distinguishing characteristic of this variety. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, roadsides, and waste areas."
