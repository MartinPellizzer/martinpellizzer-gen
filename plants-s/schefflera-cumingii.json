    "intro": "Schefflera cumingii, commonly known as the Cuming's umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that resemble an umbrella, typically with 5 to 9 leaflets radiating from a central point. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers followed by red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, warm environments and is often cultivated as a decorative indoor plant. Its adaptability and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for both ornamental and horticultural purposes."
