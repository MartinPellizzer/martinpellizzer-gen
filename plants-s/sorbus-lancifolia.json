    "intro": "Sorbus lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a bright red or orange color. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often peeling in thin layers. Sorbus lancifolia plays an important role in its native ecosystems, providing food for wildlife and contributing to forest biodiversity."
