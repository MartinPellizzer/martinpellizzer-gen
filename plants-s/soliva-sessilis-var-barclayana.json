    "intro": "Soliva sessilis var. barclayana, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 1 inch wide, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil in arid environments. It is adapted to withstand drought and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
