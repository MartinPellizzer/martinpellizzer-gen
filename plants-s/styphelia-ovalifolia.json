    "intro": "Styphelia ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It typically features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a humid, cool climate to flourish. Styphelia ovalifolia is often found in heathlands and coastal heath communities, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
