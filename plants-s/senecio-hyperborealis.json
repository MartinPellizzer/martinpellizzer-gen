    "intro": "Senecio hyperborealis, commonly known as the Arctic groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in harsh, cold environments with limited soil nutrients. The plant features dense, hairy foliage that helps insulate it against freezing temperatures. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Senecio hyperborealis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by stabilizing soil and providing food for local wildlife."
