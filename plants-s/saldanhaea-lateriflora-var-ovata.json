    "intro": "Saldanhaea lateriflora var. ovata, commonly known as the broad-leaved sand verbena, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, grayish hairs, and its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, often with a slightly wavy margin. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant adapted to coastal climates. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for native gardens and restoration projects."
