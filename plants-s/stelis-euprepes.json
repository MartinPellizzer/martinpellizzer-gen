    "intro": "Stelis euprepes, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a short, thick rhizome with several fleshy, oval-shaped pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are usually pale green or white with a distinct lip, and they bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Stelis euprepes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
