It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring upright stems covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, often with five petals. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and have a soft, hairy texture. Sida polystachia is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage."
