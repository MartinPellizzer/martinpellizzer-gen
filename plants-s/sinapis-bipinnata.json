    "intro": "Sinapis bipinnata, commonly known as the double-lobed mustard, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves, which are deeply divided into two pairs of leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in elongated racemes, followed by small, triangular pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Sinapis bipinnata is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
