    "intro": "Salix neglecta, commonly known as the common willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically green on top and whitish underneath. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as streams and ponds. Salix neglecta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological habitats."
