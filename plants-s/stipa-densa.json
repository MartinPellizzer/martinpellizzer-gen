    "intro": "Stipa densa, commonly known as dense needlegrass, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Stipa densa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
