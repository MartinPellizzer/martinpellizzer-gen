    "intro": "Styphelia collina, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern and western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage and small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Styphelia collina is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
