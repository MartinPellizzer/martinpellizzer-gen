    "intro": "Stellaria decumbens, commonly known as lesser starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features prostrate or ascending stems that are covered with fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are oval to lance-shaped, with a hairy surface, and it often grows in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows and roadsides. Stellaria decumbens is known for its ability to spread via stolons, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in various habitats."
