    "intro": "Schotia tamarindifolia, commonly known as the yellowwood tree, is a deciduous tree native to South Africa. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and compound leaves. The tree produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by round, woody fruits containing edible seeds. Schotia tamarindifolia is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species in regions with limited rainfall. Its wood is valued for its durability and resistance to decay, though it is not commonly used commercially."
