    "intro": "Santolina magna, commonly known as giant santolina, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, silver-gray foliage composed of narrow, needle-like leaves that are densely packed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Santolina magna is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice in xeriscaping and Mediterranean-style gardens."
