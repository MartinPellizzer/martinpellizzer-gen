    "intro": "Salix triandra, commonly known as the African weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a graceful, weeping appearance. The leaves are oval-shaped, alternate, and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by fluffy, cotton-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
