    "intro": "Saxifraga yushuensis, commonly known as the Yushu saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in rocky or alpine regions. The plant features small, clustered leaves and produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink. It is adapted to cold climates and has a specialized root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
