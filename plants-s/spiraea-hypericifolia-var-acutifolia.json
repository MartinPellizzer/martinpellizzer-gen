It features slender, arching stems that produce clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring. The leaves are elliptical, serrated, and have a pointed tip, giving it its \"acutifolia\" designation. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a suitable plant for garden borders or woodland edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
