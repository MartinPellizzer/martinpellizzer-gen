    "intro": "Strychnos cayennensis, commonly known as the Cayenne strychnos, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain toxic seeds, which are rich in alkaloids such as strychnine and brucine. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided for culinary or medicinal use despite its ornamental appeal. Its botanical features make it a notable species in the study of toxic plants and plant chemistry."
