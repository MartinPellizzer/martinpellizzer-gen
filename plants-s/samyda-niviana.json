It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has finely divided, silvery-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance, and it is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Samyda niviana is adapted to cold climates and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Its botanical features make it a unique addition to gardens in cooler regions."
