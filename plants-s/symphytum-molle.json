    "intro": "Symphytum molle, commonly known as softwood comfrey, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are soft and velvety to the touch. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, which contribute to its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Symphytum molle is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported healing properties."
