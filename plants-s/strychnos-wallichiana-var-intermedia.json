It is native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal, where it thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by subtle differences in leaf morphology and fruit structure."
