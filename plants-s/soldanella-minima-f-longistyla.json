    "intro": "Soldanella minima f. longistyla, commonly known as the slender snowbell, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is typically found in high-altitude meadows. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
