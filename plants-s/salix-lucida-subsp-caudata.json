    "intro": "Salix lucida subsp. caudata, commonly known as the long-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with yellow or red on the underside. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of willow species and contain both male and female flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
