    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 schachtii, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environments. Saxifraga \u00d7 schachtii is also noted for its ability to form hybrids with other saxifrage species, contributing to its genetic diversity."
