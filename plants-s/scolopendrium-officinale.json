    "intro": "Scolopendrium officinale, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a species of evergreen fern that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain spores for reproduction. Its leaves are scale-like and form a compact rosette, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Scolopendrium officinale is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
