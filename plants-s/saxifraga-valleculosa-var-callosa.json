    "intro": "Saxifraga valleculosa var. callosa, commonly known as the roughleaf saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features basal leaves that are lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. Its small, white or pinkish flowers bloom in early summer, usually in clusters at the ends of the stems. The variety callosa is characterized by its rough, textured leaves, which help it retain moisture in its harsh, high-altitude habitat."
