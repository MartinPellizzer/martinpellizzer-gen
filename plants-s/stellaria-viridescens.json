    "intro": "Stellaria viridescens, commonly known as green starwort, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Its stems are usually prostrate or ascending, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Stellaria viridescens is noted for its ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction."
