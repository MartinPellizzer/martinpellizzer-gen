    "intro": "Sida hulseana, commonly known as the blueweed or sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is typically found in sandy or saline soils, thriving in coastal dunes and maritime environments. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Sida hulseana is an important species for stabilizing dunes and supporting coastal biodiversity."
