    "intro": "Selaginella intermedia var. intermedia, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and dense clusters of spirally arranged, needle-like leaves. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporophyte stage produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are borne on the upper surface of the leaves. Selaginella intermedia var. intermedia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
