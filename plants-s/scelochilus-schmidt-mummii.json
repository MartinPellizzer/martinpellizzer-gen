    "intro": "Scelochilus schmidt-mummii, commonly known as the Schmidt-Mumm's scelochilus, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the Andean highlands of South America. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that typically display vibrant colors such as red, orange, or yellow. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine conditions where it relies on specific microclimates for survival. Its botanical features include opposite, ovate leaves and a compact, herbaceous stem structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
