    "intro": "Schefflera lineata, commonly known as the silver nettle, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, with a dense, bushy habit that makes it suitable for indoor cultivation. Its leaves are arranged in a distinctive, almost fern-like pattern, adding visual interest to any space. Schefflera lineata is relatively low maintenance, thriving in bright, indirect light and requiring moderate watering."
