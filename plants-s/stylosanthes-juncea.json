    "intro": "Stylosanthes juncea, commonly known as small cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods containing small, edible seeds that are rich in protein. It is often used as a forage crop and in soil improvement due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Stylosanthes juncea is also valued for its adaptability to poor soils and drought conditions."
