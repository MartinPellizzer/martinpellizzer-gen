    "intro": "Solidago neglecta var. uniligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are linear and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinct appearance. This plant thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies during the late summer season."
