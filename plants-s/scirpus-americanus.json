    "intro": "Scirpus americanus, commonly known as American bulrush, is a tall, herbaceous wetland plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant features cylindrical, grass-like stems that are often covered in a thick layer of brown, woolly hair. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, consist of small, greenish-brown flowers arranged in dense clusters. Scirpus americanus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
