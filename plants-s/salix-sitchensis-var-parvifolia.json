    "intro": "Salix sitchensis var. parvifolia, commonly known as the Sitka willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its small, ovate leaves that are usually less than 2 cm in length. The leaves are typically pubescent, with a bluish-green underside, and they turn yellow in the fall. This variety is distinguished from other willow species by its compact form and unique leaf morphology. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetland habitats."
