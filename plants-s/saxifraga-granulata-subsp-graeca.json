    "intro": "Saxifraga granulata subsp. graeca, commonly known as the Greek saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans and Turkey. It features rosettes of fleshy, ovate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of pink or white, during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
