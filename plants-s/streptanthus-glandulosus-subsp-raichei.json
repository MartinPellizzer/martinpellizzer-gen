    "intro": "Streptanthus glandulosus subsp. raichei, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard plants, and produces small, capsule-like fruits. This subspecies is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountain environments."
