    "intro": "Solanum reclinatum, commonly known as the creeping nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, sparsely hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, rounded berries that turn red when mature. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative propagation."
