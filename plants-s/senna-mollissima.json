    "intro": "Senna mollissima, commonly known as silky senna, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that are soft and silky to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. Its seeds are encased in long, slender pods, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Senna mollissima is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a garden plant."
