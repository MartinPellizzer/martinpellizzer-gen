    "intro": "Stelis samson, commonly known as the Samson orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant typically features slender, upright pseudobulbs that support its linear leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in shades of white, pink, or purple, and bloom during the warmer months. Stelis samson is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
