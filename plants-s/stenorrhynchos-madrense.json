    "intro": "Stenorrhynchos madrense, commonly known as the Madre\u00f1o orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andean region of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapting to the high-altitude environments where it thrives. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
