    "intro": "Specklinia tripterantha, commonly known as the three-winged fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are divided into three narrow, elongated lobes. The plant typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, relying on atmospheric moisture for survival. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain water. Specklinia tripterantha is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ease of care in the right conditions."
