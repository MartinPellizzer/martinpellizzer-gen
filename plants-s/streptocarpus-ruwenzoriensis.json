It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to violet. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot."
