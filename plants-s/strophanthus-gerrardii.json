    "intro": "Strophanthus gerrardii, commonly known as the African blood vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. Its roots and leaves contain cardioactive alkaloids, making it historically significant in traditional medicine. However, due to its toxic properties, it is not recommended for cultivation without proper expertise."
