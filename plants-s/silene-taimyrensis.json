    "intro": "Silene taimyrensis, commonly known as the Taimyra catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of up to 20 centimeters. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in early summer, usually from June to July. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. Silene taimyrensis is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats."
