    "intro": "Schoenia ramosissima, commonly known as the desert broom, is a shrub native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has adapted to harsh environments with its deep root system and water-storing tissues. Its leaves are typically small and leathery to reduce water loss. Schoenia ramosissima plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
