It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange, adding vibrant color to the landscape. Steffensia hirsuta is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments."
