    "intro": "Smilax biflora, commonly known as the twinflower smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It features woody stems covered in sharp, curved spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in pairs, giving it its common name. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough, textured surface. Smilax biflora is often found in moist, wooded areas and is known for its ability to climb or trail along the ground."
