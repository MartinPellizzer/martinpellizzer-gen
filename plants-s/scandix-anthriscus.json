    "intro": "Scandix anthriscus, commonly known as bishop's weed, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust, hollow stem that is often reddish in color and covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, white, umbrella-shaped inflorescences that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are finely divided, with a mild, aromatic scent and a slightly spicy taste. Scandix anthriscus is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its ornamental foliage and historical use in herbal medicine."
