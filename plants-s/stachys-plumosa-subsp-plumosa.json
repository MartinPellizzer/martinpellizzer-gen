It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that are often grayish-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spikes of purple or blue flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Stachys plumosa subsp. plumosa is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in temperate climates."
