    "intro": "Spinulum subarcticum, commonly known as the Arctic spinulum, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale pink, and it has hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Spinulum subarcticum is often found in alpine tundra and open habitats where it contributes to the local biodiversity. Its resilience to extreme temperatures makes it an important component of subarctic ecosystems."
