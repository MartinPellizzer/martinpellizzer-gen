    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 lochsiensis, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree that belongs to the Salicaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Salix alba (white willow) and Salix cinerea (grey willow), resulting in a plant with unique morphological characteristics. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture and a silvery underside. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and lakes. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
