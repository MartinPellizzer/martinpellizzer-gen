It is characterized by its clusters of small, white, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
