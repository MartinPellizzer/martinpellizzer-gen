    "intro": "Schoepfia obovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed schoepfia, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features upright stems with opposite, ovate to obovate leaves that are typically hairy and have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its fibrous roots make it drought-tolerant and well-suited for arid environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low water requirements."
