    "intro": "Solanum urubambaense, commonly known as the Urubamba nightshade, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its erect or semi-erect growth habit. The plant typically produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that range in color from green to red. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in cloud forests and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Solanum genus."
