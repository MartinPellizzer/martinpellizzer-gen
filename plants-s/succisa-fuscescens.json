    "intro": "Succisa fuscescens, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and showy, violet-blue petals that surround a central cone-like structure. The plant produces small, yellow tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Succisa fuscescens thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in prairies and open woodlands."
