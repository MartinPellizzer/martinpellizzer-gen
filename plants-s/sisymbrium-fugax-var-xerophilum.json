    "intro": "Sisymbrium fugax var. xerophilum, commonly known as the desertflix, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. It produces slender, erect stems that bear clusters of tiny, pod-like fruits. This species is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with minimal water availability."
