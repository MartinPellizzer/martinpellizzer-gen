    "intro": "Soldanella montana var. minor, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a fine layer of silky hairs, aiding in water retention. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
