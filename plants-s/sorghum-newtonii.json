    "intro": "Sorghum newtonii, commonly known as the Newton's sorghum, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance due to its deep root system. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with bract-like leaves, and its seeds are encased in hard, fibrous hulls. It is often found in rocky soils and can contribute to soil stabilization in degraded landscapes. Despite its hardiness, it is not widely cultivated for agricultural purposes."
