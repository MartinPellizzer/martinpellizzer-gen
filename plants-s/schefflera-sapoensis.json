It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like canopy of large, leathery, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Schefflera sapoensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
