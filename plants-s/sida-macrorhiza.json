It is an annual herb that typically grows in wetland or marshy environments. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its roots are thick and fleshy, which help it thrive in waterlogged soils. Sida macrorhiza is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
