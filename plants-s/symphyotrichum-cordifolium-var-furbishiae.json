    "intro": "Symphyotrichum cordifolium var. furbishiae, commonly known as Furbish's aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of purple to blue flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. It has a fibrous root system and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
