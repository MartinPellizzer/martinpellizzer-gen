    "intro": "Sagittaria graminea subsp. graminea, commonly known as narrowleaf arrowhead, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface or stand upright in shallow water. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, appearing in clusters at the water's surface. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for insects and serving as a food source for waterfowl."
