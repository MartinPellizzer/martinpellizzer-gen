    "intro": "Salix vagans var. cinerascens, commonly known as the cinerascens willow, is a variant of the weeping willow characterized by its distinctive silvery-gray bark and slender, drooping branches. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and wetlands. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its unique appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and parks. The species is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
