    "intro": "Strophanthus minor, commonly known as the African blood vine, is a climbing shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, yellowish-green flowers, followed by bright orange or red berries. Its ornamental value is notable, but it is also known for containing toxic cardiac glycosides. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in residential areas."
