    "intro": "Syntherisma fusca, commonly known as the dark green orchid, is a rare and unique species belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. Its botanical structure includes a short rhizome and a single stem that supports its foliage. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, Syntherisma fusca is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
