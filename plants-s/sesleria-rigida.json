    "intro": "Sesleria rigida, commonly known as the rigid sesleria, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. It produces delicate white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Sesleria rigida is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
