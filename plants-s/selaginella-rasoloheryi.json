    "intro": "Selaginella rasoloheryi, commonly known as the Madagascar spikemoss, is a rare and unique species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant exhibits a distinctive reproductive structure called a strobilus, which contains the sporangia for spore production. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
