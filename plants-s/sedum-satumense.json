It features fleshy, upright stems and small, pale green to silver-colored leaves that help it store water. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in arid conditions with minimal care."
