    "intro": "Sida hoheri, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Sida hoheri is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in desert scrub habitats. Its fibrous roots and drought tolerance make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
