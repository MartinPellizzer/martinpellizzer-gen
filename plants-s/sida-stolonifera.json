    "intro": "Sida stolonifera, commonly known as wireweed or seaside cotton, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or saline soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, white, fluffy flowers that are arranged in clusters, and it has alternate, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces. Sida stolonifera spreads through stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to colonize new areas rapidly. It is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
