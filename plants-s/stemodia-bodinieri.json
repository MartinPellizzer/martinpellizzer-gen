    "intro": "Stemodia bodinieri, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its milky sap, which is toxic, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Stemodia bodinieri is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, thriving in well-drained soils."
