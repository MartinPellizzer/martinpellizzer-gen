    "intro": "Sorghastrum nutans subsp. albescens, commonly known as whiteleaf dropseed, is a grass species native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered with a fine, white bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, meadows, and woodland edges. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant gardens."
