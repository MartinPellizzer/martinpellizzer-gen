    "intro": "Salix caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. The bark is smooth and light gray, with a distinctive flaky texture."
