    "intro": "Stolidia mauritiana, commonly known as the Mauritius star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to the island of Mauritius. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves and produces clusters of small, white flowers on slender stems. It is often found in coastal areas and rocky habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in its native range."
