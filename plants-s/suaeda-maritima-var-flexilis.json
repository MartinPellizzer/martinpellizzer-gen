    "intro": "Suaeda maritima var. flexilis, commonly known as sea spurry, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding survival in arid coastal regions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its root system is extensive, helping to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. This variety is often found in salt marshes and estuarine habitats along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts."
