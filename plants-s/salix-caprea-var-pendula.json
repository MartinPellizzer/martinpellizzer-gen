    "intro": "Salix caprea var. pendula, commonly known as weeping willow, is a variant of the European shrub willow characterized by its distinctive cascading branches. This plant is native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are elongated, serrated, and typically turn yellow in the autumn. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are followed by narrow, woody fruits. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in landscaping for its graceful appearance."
