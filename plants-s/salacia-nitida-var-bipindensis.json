    "intro": "Salacia nitida var. bipindensis, commonly known as the slender salacia, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Salaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in the mountainous areas of Myanmar and Thailand. This plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The flowers are small and yellowish-green, typically appearing in clusters, and the fruit is a fleshy, orange-red berry that contains several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
