    "intro": "Syzygium fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's apple or the white apple, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves and clusters of fragrant white flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its fruit is a small, smooth, white or yellowish berry that is edible but not widely cultivated for commercial use. Syzygium fraseri plays a role in local ecosystems and is sometimes grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance."
