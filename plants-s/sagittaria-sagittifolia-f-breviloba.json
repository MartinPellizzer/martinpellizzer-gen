    "intro": "Sagittaria sagittifolia f. breviloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arrowhead, is a aquatic plant characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that are narrower than those of the typical species. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments, such as marshes and pond margins, where it can receive ample sunlight. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. The narrow leaves and compact growth make it a distinctive variant within the Sagittaria genus."
