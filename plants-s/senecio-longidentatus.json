    "intro": "Senecio longidentatus, commonly known as the long-toothed groundsel, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves with prominent, tooth-like margins. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
