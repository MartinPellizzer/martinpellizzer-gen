It is characterized by its compact, columnar growth habit and distinctive conical inflorescences. The plant produces small, cherry-like fruits that are typically red when mature. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with lower atmospheric pressure. This form is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and potential for cultivation in specialized environments."
