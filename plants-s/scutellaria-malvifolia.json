It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.

Its ornamental value and ecological benefits make it a desirable plant for native gardens and conservation efforts."
