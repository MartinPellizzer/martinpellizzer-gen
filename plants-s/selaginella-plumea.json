This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Selaginella plumea is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique ability to survive in arid conditions through its specialized structures. Its reproductive structures, including strobila, are essential for its propagation and ecological role in its native habitat."
