    "intro": "Salix retusa var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray-barked stems and lanceolate, often rounded leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetland areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat for various wildlife species."
