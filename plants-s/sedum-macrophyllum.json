    "intro": "Sedum macrophyllum, commonly known as the Sierra foxtail, is a succulent plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid environments with minimal irrigation."
