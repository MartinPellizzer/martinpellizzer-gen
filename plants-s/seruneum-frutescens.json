    "intro": "Seruneum frutescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by egg-shaped, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many regions where it has been introduced."
