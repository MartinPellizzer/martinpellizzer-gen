    "intro": "Scorpiurus echinatus var. laevigatus, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its smooth, cylindrical stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This variant is distinguished by its reduced spines compared to the typical form of Scorpiurus echinatus."
