    "intro": "Seriphidium incultum, commonly known as the desert gumweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and can withstand drought conditions due to its deep root system. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, with a distinctive aromatic scent when crushed. Seriphidium incultum is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of these environments."
