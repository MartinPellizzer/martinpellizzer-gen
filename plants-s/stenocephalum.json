    "intro": "Stenocephalum, commonly known as the narrow-headed bush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae. It is native to Australia and comprises several species, many of which are shrubs with dense, often aromatic foliage. The plants typically have small, tubular or bell-shaped flowers that are often brightly colored, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Stenocephalum species are well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting various mechanisms to conserve water. Their botanical features make them valuable in horticulture and ecological restoration projects."
