    "intro": "Stapelia tridentata, commonly known as the three-lobed carrion flower, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, triangular stems and its distinctive, waxy flowers that resemble decaying flesh. The plant produces large, yellowish-green blooms with red veins, which emit a strong odor to attract pollinators. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic conditions. Stapelia tridentata is often cultivated for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
