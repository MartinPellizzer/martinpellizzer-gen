    "intro": "Sedum lobelii, commonly known as the lobel's stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color and have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture. Sedum lobelii is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
