    "intro": "Stellaria dichotoma var. linearis, commonly known as the slender starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features wiry stems that often branch at the base, forming dense mats or cushions. The leaves are narrow and linear, typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stem. Small white or pale blue flowers appear in clusters, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that release tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
