    "intro": "Sedum forsterianum subsp. elegans, commonly known as the elegant stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact size and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plants."
