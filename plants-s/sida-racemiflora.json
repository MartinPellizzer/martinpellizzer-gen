    "intro": "Sida racemiflora, commonly known as the coastal bladdernut, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in dune or beach environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are borne on slender stalks. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a rough texture and a distinctive glandular surface. Sida racemiflora is adapted to salt spray and wind, making it a hardy species found in coastal ecosystems."
