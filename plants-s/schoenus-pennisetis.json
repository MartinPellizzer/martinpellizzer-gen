    "intro": "Schoenus pennisetis, commonly known as the flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often pale green or brown. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in aquatic environments. Schoenus pennisetis is adapted to tolerate waterlogged conditions and is often found in areas with high humidity and fluctuating water levels."
