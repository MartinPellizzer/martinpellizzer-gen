    "intro": "Setachna montana, commonly known as the mountain setachna, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
