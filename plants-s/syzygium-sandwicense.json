    "intro": "Syzygium sandwicense, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has simple, opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species."
