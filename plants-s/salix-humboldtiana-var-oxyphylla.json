    "intro": "Salix humboldtiana var. oxyphylla, commonly known as the Humboldt's willow or the yellow-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive yellow-green leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male, while female flowers are found on separate plants. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a tendency to peel in thin layers. This variety is adapted to riparian environments and is often found along riverbanks and moist soils."
