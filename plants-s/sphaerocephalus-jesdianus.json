    "intro": "Sphaerocephalus jesdianus, commonly known as the globe-headed orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive spherical flower head, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its flowers are small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pink and purple. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
