    "intro": "Selaginella imbricata var. erecta, commonly known as the upright clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in a tight spiral. This variety is native to regions with temperate climates, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant produces sporophytes that bear spore capsules, which are typically clustered at the tips of its stems. Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an important subject in the study of ancient plant lineages and evolutionary botany."
