    "intro": "Selaginella corallina, commonly known as the coral spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern ally native to arid and rocky habitats in North America. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and its ability to thrive in dry conditions, making it a resilient plant in harsh environments. The plant features creeping stems with spirally arranged, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its spore-producing structures, called sporophylls, are clustered in cone-like formations at the ends of the stems. Selaginella corallina is also notable for its ability to survive extreme drought by entering a dormant state, a trait that contributes to its ecological significance in desert ecosystems."
