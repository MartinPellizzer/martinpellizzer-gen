    "intro": "Sedum tricarpum, commonly known as the three-ovary sedum, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum tricarpum is known for its drought tolerance and ability to store water in its leaves, which helps it survive in arid environments."
