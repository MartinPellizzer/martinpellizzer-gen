It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and pale yellow to brownish flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky areas, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered with a dense layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and potential medicinal properties."
