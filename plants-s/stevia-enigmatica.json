    "intro": "Stevia enigmatica, commonly known as the mysterious sweetleaf, is a rare shrub native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its flowers, which are typically white or pale yellow, are borne in clusters and attract various pollinators. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Stevia enigmatica remains a subject of botanical study and conservation efforts."
