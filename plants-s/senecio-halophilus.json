    "intro": "Senecio halophilus, commonly known as the saltbush or salt plant, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to dry environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its salt tolerance allows it to thrive in saline soils, making it a valuable species for coastal restoration projects. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties."
