    "intro": "Salix hastata var. vegeta, commonly known as the vegetated willow, is a shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as stream banks, marshes, and wet meadows. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are male and female, contributing to its role in riparian ecosystems. The species is valued for its ecological importance in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
