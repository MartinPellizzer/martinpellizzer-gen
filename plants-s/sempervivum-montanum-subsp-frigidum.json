    "intro": "Sempervivum montanum subsp. frigidum, commonly known as the alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosettes of fleshy, thick leaves that are typically green or blue-green in color. The plant is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in rocky or gravelly soils. It produces small, pink or red flowers in late summer, and it is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness. This subspecies is particularly valued for its ability to survive in harsh, alpine environments."
