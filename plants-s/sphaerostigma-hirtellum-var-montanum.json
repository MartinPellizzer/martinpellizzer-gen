    "intro": "Sphaerostigma hirtellum var. montanum, commonly known as the mountain sphaerostigma, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, with small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptability to high-altitude environments makes it a resilient species in harsh, rocky soils. The leaves and stems are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
