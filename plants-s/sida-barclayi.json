    "intro": "Sida barclayi, commonly known as the coastal seepweed, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of the United States. It is a low-growing herb that thrives in coastal environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils near the shore. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy. Sida barclayi is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it a hardy species in coastal ecosystems. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
