    "intro": "Schefflera grisea, commonly known as the gray schefflera, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, palm-like foliage with bright green, glossy leaves that are arranged in a compact, umbrella-like pattern. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a decorative indoor plant. Schefflera grisea is valued for its ornamental appeal and air-purifying qualities."
