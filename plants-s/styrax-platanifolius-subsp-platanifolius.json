It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, woody capsules containing aromatic resin. Its bark is thick and fissured, often exuding a resinous sap that has been used in traditional medicine. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in perfumery and medicinal applications."
