It is a low-growing shrub with small, evergreen leaves that are typically narrow and elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers during the autumn season. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal heath communities. Styphelia oblongifolia is an important component of the local flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
