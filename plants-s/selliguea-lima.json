    "intro": "Selliguea lima, commonly known as the lima liverwort, is a small, mat-forming liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its closely spaced, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in tropical and subtropical regions. Its structure consists of a thallus with distinct dorsal and ventral lobes, and it reproduces via spores released from leaf-like structures called gametophores. Selliguea lima plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various small organisms."
