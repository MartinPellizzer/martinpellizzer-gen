    "intro": "Stenaria umbratilis, commonly known as the shadowy stenaria, is a flowering plant native to the shaded understories of tropical forests. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble single blooms. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are elongated and slightly hairy, adapted to capture limited sunlight in low-light conditions. Stenaria umbratilis is often found growing on rocky substrates or in moist, shaded areas within its native habitat."
