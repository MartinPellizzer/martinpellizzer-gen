    "intro": "Sternbergia sparffiordiana, commonly known as the Armenian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Armenia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
