    "intro": "Salix japonica f. pygmaea, commonly known as the Japanese weeping willow, is a compact, ornamental form of the willow tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its narrow, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, oval leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal. Due to its size and form, it is suitable for smaller gardens or as a specimen plant in larger spaces."
