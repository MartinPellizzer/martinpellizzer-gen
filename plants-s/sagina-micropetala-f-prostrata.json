It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and pale blue to pinkish flowers. The plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. It is a perennial species that spreads through stolons, forming dense cushions that help stabilize soil in harsh conditions. Its botanical features make it well adapted to cold, nutrient-poor environments."
