It features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are ovate with prominent veins, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into rounded, yellowish berries. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in urban environments, gardens, and along roadsides.
