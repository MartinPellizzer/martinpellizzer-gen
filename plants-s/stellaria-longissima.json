    "intro": "Stellaria longissima, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. The leaves are ovate or rounded, often with a hairy texture, and the stems are usually prostrate or ascending. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, gardens, and along pathways. The plant is known for its ability to spread rapidly through seeds and is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated areas."
