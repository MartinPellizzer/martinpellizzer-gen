    "intro": "Salvia lentiginosa, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive purple-pink flower heads that resemble small cones, surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy texture, while its stems are square, a common trait among the mint family. Salvia lentiginosa is known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
