    "intro": "Saponaria prostrata var. calvertii, commonly known as the Calvert's soapwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features wiry, prostrate stems that form a dense mat of foliage, often reaching heights of less than 10 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a slightly hairy texture, and are arranged alternately along the stems. This variety is adapted to moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks."
