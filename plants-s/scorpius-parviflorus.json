    "intro": "Scorpius parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered scorpius, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, delicate white flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has dark green, narrow leaves that are adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. Scorpius parviflorus is often found growing in rocky soils and is highly susceptible to habitat loss. Due to its limited distribution and fragility, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
