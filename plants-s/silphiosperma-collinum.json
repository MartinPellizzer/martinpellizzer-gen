    "intro": "Silphiosperma collinum, commonly known as the mountain silphium, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces a distinctive, elongated seed capsule. Silphiosperma collinum is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments through deep root systems and succulent foliage."
