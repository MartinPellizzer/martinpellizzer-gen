    "intro": "Sorbus speciosa, commonly known as the showy whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive red or orange berries in the fall. The leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a serrated margin, turning yellow in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky slopes. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
