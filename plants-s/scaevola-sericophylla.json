It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and small, showy flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The leaves are silver-gray in appearance, covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
