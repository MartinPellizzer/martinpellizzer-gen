    "intro": "Santiriopsis klaineana, commonly known as the Klamath mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of coniferous trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or pink flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its berries are edible for some bird species, which helps in seed dispersal. Santiriopsis klaineana plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing tree growth and providing food for wildlife."
