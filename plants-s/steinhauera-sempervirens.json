    "intro": "Steinhauera sempervirens, commonly known as the evergreen stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. Steinhauera sempervirens is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
