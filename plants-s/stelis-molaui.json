    "intro": "Stelis molaui, commonly known as the Molaui orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features slender, often clustered stems and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis molaui is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
