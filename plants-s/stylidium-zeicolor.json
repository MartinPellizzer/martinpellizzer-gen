    "intro": "Stylidium zeicolor, commonly known as the rainbow jewelweed, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Commelinaceae and is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that range from red to orange and yellow. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Its leaves are alternate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Stylidium zeicolor is often found in moist, shaded areas such as rainforests and along stream banks."
