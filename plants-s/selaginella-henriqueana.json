    "intro": "Selaginella henriqueana, commonly known as the Brazilian spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant in the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its wiry stems and small, scale-like leaves that form dense, cushion-like clusters. It produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Selaginella henriqueana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
