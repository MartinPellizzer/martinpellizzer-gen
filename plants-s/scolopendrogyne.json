    "intro": "Scolopendrogyne, commonly known as the false arrowhead, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plants typically have arrowhead-shaped leaves, which give them their common name. They are herbaceous perennials that often grow in moist, shady environments. Scolopendrogyne species produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spadices, a characteristic feature of the Araceae family."
