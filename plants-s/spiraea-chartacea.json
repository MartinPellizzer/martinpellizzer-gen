It is characterized by its dense, rounded form and its showy clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and slightly serrated. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, moist soils. Spiraea chartacea is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
