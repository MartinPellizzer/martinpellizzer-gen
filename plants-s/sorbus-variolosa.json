    "intro": "Sorbus variolosa, commonly known as the variegated whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely toothed leaves that often display variegation, particularly in the varietal form. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits called soroses, which are typically white or yellowish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. Sorbus variolosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
