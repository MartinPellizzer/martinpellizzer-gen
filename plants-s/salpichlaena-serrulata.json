    "intro": "Salpichlaena serrulata, commonly known as the serrated shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are often covered in tiny, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. Salpichlaena serrulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in humid, indoor gardens."
