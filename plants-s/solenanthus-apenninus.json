    "intro": "Solenanthus apenninus, commonly known as the Apennine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of blue to violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought tolerance. Solenanthus apenninus is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
