It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are typically pale green to brown in color. This variety is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy plant in dry conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
