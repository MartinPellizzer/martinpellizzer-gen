    "intro": "Santalum austrocaledonicum var. minutum, commonly known as the dwarf sandalwood, is a small shrub native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, woody scent. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients. Its small, leathery leaves and fragrant flowers are adapted to its tropical rainforest habitat. Due to its rarity and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
