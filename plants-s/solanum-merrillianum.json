    "intro": "Solanum merrillianum, commonly known as the Merril's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its attractive, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals due to the presence of alkaloids. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is important to handle it with care due to its toxic properties."
