It has small, leathery, elliptical leaves that are dark green with prominent black veins, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its berries are usually red or yellow, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Syngonanthus atrovirens plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for various bird species and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
