    "intro": "Salvia occultiflora, commonly known as the ghostflower sage, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its unique, pale purple to almost white flowers that appear in late summer, giving it its common name. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Salvia occultiflora is considered a rare and endangered species."
