It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice among gardeners interested in xeriscaping."
