    "intro": "Salix atrocinerea subf. barcinonensis, commonly known as the Barcino black willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and narrow, elongated leaves with a slightly hairy underside. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along riverbanks and wetlands. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
