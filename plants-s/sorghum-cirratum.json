    "intro": "Sorghum cirratum, commonly known as the curlytop sorghum, is a flowering plant native to Africa and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its tall, erect stalks and striking, feathery inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers, which are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in warm, arid climates and is often grown as a forage crop or for its grain. Sorghum cirratum is also valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens and public landscapes."
