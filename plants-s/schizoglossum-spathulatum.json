    "intro": "Schizoglossum spathulatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved schizoglossum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate to spatulate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Schizoglossum spathulatum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in suitable climates."
