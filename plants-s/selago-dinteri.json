    "intro": "Selago dinteri, commonly known as the Dinter's selago, is a rare and endangered plant native to the arid regions of Namibia. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its compact, succulent growth habit. The plant features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces delicate white or pale blue flowers during the rainy season, typically in summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Selago dinteri is highly susceptible to environmental changes and human disturbance."
