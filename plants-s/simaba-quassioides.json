    "intro": "Simaba quassioides, commonly known as the Guiana apple or wild apple, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to apples, though they have a distinct, slightly sour taste. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
