    "intro": "Spermacoce depressa, commonly known as the prostrate sida, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant with slender, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. Spermacoce depressa is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
