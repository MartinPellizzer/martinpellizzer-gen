    "intro": "Saurauia alkmaarensis, commonly known as the Alkmara saurauia, is a rare and endemic shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Carpathian Basin. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, preferring acidic and well-drained soils. Its botanical features include glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, which help in reducing water loss in its often harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
