    "intro": "Salvia tmolea, commonly known as narrowleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a drought-tolerant species suitable for xeriscaping. Salvia tmolea is also valued for its aromatic properties and historical use in traditional medicine."
