    "intro": "Saxifraga muralis, commonly known as the wall saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found growing on limestone or rocky walls. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shady, moist areas."
