    "intro": "Smilax gracillima, commonly known as the slender greenbriar, is a vigorous climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, thornless stems that can twine around other plants or structures. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually oval to elliptic in shape. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels and are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Smilax gracillima is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and along stream banks."
