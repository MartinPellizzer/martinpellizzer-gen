It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
