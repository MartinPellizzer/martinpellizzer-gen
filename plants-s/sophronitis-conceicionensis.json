It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a single, narrow pseudobulb and a single leaf. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive violet-blue color and a yellow lip. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
