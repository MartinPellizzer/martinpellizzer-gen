    "intro": "Sambucus melanocarpa f. communis, commonly known as the common black elderberry, is a shrub native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves with 5\u20137 leaflets and its clusters of small, black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant is part of the Adoxaceae family and is known for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine. Its berries are used in culinary applications, though they must be cooked to remove toxic compounds. The plant also serves as a host for the elderberry aphid and provides nectar for pollinators."
