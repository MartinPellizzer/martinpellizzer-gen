    "intro": "Salix villarsiana, commonly known as the Tibetan willow, is a deciduous shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, ovate leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Salix villarsiana is adapted to cold climates and is often found growing at elevations above 3,000 meters."
