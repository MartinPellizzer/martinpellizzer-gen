    "intro": "Stipa tehuelches, commonly known as the Tehuelche needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the Patagonian region of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spiky inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Stipa tehuelches plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
