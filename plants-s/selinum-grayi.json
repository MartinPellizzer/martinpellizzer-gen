It is a perennial herb native to the western United States, typically found in dry, rocky habitats. The plant features slender stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a silvery-gray pubescence. Its small, white flowers are arranged in flat-topped clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Selinum grayi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
