    "intro": "Salix reinii f. eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, silver-white pubescent leaves that give it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its growth habit is typically prostrate or sprawling, allowing it to colonize rocky or alpine soils. The species is adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting tolerance to cold and drought conditions."
