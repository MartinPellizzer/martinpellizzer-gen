    "intro": "Scirpus ebenocarpus, commonly known as the black-root bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has fibrous roots that are dark brown in color, contributing to its common name. Its leaves are long and narrow, often with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in waterlogged soils. Scirpus ebenocarpus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
