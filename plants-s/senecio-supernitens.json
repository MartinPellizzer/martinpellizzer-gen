    "intro": "Senecio supernitens, commonly known as the silverleaf groundsel, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with silvery-white, woolly leaves that reflect light and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
