    "intro": "Solanum unilobum, commonly known as the single-lobed nightshade, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring simple, alternate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are usually white or pale purple, with five petals, and it produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans and animals. The plant's botanical features make it distinct within the nightshade family, though it is not widely cultivated for agricultural or ornamental purposes."
