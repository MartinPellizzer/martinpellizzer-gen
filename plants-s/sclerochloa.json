    "intro": "Sclerochloa, commonly known as the hard grass or needlegrass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. These plants are characterized by their tough, fibrous leaves and dense, often tufted growth habit. Sclerochloa species are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, where they thrive in sandy or rocky soils. They play an important role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in their native habitats. Some species are also used for forage or in traditional medicine."
