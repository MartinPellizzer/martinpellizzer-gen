    "intro": "Selaginella rupestris f. engelmannii, commonly known as Engelmann's spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its creeping growth habit and distinctive, scale-like leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on forest floors. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the reproductive organs. Its leaves are typically pale green to reddish in color, and the plant is known for its ability to survive in low-light conditions. This fern ally is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems."
