    "intro": "Sorghum, commonly known as milo, is a warm-season grass native to Africa and widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is valued for its high yield and adaptability to various soil types. The plant produces tall, cylindrical stalks with small, clustered flowers, and its seeds are encased in a hard outer shell. Sorghum is rich in carbohydrates and is used for food, animal feed, and biofuel production. Its drought tolerance makes it an important crop in arid and semi-arid climates."
