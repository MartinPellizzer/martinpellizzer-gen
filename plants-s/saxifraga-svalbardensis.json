    "intro": "Saxifraga svalbardensis, commonly known as the Svalbard saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic regions of Svalbard. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in cold, rocky environments, often found in alpine and subarctic habitats. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the short summer season. Its leaves are typically succulent, adapted to retain moisture in the harsh, dry climate. Saxifraga svalbardensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the alpine flora diversity."
