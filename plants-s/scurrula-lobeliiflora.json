    "intro": "Scurrula lobeliiflora, commonly known as the flame flower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its striking red-orange bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. It produces small, tubular flowers that are pollinated by hummingbirds and other nectar-feeding insects. Scurrula lobeliiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical gardens."
