    "intro": "Salix sitchensis, commonly known as Sitka willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, often boggy environments, making it a common species in wetland ecosystems. Salix sitchensis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
