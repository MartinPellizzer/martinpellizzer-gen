    "intro": "Saldanhaea lateriflora var. elliptica, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
