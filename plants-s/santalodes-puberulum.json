    "intro": "Santalodes puberulum, commonly known as the hairy sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Santalaceae and is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The wood of Santalodes puberulum is highly valued for its aromatic properties and is used in traditional medicine and perfumery."
