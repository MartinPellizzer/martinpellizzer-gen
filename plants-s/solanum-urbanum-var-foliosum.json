It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries containing toxic alkaloids. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found growing along roadsides or in urban environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a weed in some regions."
