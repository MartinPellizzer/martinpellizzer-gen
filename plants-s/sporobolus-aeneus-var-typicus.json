    "intro": "Sporobolus aeneus var. typicus, commonly known as bluegrass or silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a valuable forage species."
