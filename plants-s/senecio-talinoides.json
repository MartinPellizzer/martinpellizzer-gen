The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens despite its potential invasiveness in some regions."
