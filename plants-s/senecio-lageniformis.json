The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
