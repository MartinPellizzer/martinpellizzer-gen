    "intro": "Spiranthes brenesii, commonly known as the Florida ladies' tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense, spiraled inflorescence of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine rocklands and wetlands. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous minute seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened or endangered in many parts of its range."
