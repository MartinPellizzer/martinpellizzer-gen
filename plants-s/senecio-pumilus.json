    "intro": "Senecio pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf ragwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South Africa. It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
