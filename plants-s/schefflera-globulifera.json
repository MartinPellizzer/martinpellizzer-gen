    "intro": "Schefflera globulifera, commonly known as the globular schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like clusters of leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as a ornamental plant. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine in its native regions."
