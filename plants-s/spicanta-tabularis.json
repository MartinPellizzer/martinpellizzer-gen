    "intro": "Spicanta tabularis, commonly known as the flat-spined spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and distinctive, spiny stems that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its latex contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to herbivores. Spicanta tabularis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
