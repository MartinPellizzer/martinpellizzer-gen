It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive violet or purple vein pattern, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow waters and is often found in marshy or swampy habitats. Its leaves are usually floating or submerged, depending on the water level and environmental conditions. Synptera subviolacea is valued in aquariums for its ornamental appearance and ability to help oxygenate water."
