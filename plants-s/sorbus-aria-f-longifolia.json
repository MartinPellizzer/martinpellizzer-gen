It is characterized by its elongated, slender leaves that are typically longer than they are wide. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its unique foliage makes it a distinctive ornamental plant in horticulture."
