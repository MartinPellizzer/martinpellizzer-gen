    "intro": "Sapindus mollis, commonly known as the soapberry tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and pinnately arranged, and its distinctive yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The tree produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed surrounded by a fleshy, orange pulp. The fruit's outer layer is covered in a fine, soapy substance, which gives the plant its common name. This unique feature has made it historically used for cleaning purposes by indigenous peoples."
