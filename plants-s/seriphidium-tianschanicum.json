    "intro": "Seriphidium tianschanicum, commonly known as the Tian Shan wormwood, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to Central Asia, particularly the Tian Shan mountain range, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Seriphidium tianschanicum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
