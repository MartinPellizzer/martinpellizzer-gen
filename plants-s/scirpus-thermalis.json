    "intro": "Scirpus thermalis, commonly known as the thermal sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to regions with geothermal activity. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and fens, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Scirpus thermalis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
