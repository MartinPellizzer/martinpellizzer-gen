    "intro": "Specklinia fastigiata, commonly known as the upright tillandsia, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and dense rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking violet or purple flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, often in clusters. Its leaves are covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps to reflect excess light and reduce water loss. Specklinia fastigiata is well-suited for indoor cultivation, requiring bright, indirect light and regular misting to thrive."
