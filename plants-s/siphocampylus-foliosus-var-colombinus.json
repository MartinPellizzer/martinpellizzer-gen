    "intro": "Siphocampylus foliosus var. colombinus, commonly known as the Colombian leafy siphocampylus, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in montane forests of South America. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters that attract various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
