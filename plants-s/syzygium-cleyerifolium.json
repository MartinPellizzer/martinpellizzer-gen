    "intro": "Syzygium cleyerifolium, commonly known as the Queensland apple or white apple, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family. It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant produces edible, apple-like fruits that are typically consumed raw or used in jams and preserves. Syzygium cleyerifolium thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and along stream banks. Its ornamental value and historical use by Indigenous Australians contribute to its ecological and cultural significance."
