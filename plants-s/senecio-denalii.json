    "intro": "Senecio denalii, commonly known as the Denali Senecio, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of Alaska and northern Canada. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine tundras, where it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Senecio denalii has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, daisy-like blooms that attract pollinators. Due to its limited range and fragile habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
