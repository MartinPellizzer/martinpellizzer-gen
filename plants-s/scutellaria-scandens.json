    "intro": "Scutellaria scandens, commonly known as climbing skullcap, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features square, hairy stems that climb or trail along the ground, often using its opposite leaves for support. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, arranged in whorls along the stem. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, serrated edge, while its roots are fibrous and rhizomatous. Scutellaria scandens is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
