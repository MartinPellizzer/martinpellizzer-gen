It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of leaflets, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, attracting various bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
