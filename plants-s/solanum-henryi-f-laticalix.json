    "intro": "Solanum henryi f. laticalix, commonly known as the Laticalix nightshade, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Solanaceae family. It is native to specific regions in China, where it thrives in temperate and subtropical climates. The plant features small, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces clusters of bell-shaped, violet to purple flowers. Its fruits are typically small berries that change color as they mature, often from green to red. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a botanically significant but understudied species."
