    "intro": "Secale cereale subsp. dighoricum, commonly known as the Dighoric rye, is a subspecies of rye native to the Caucasus region. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that bear small, two-lobed florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It produces seeds that are generally smaller than those of common rye, and the plant is adapted to grow in temperate climates with well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the genus Secale."
