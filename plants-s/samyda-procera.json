    "intro": "Samyda procera, commonly known as the tall senna, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and compound leaves with oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural distribution. Samyda procera is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
