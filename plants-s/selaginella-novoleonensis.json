It is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves and small, cone-like sporophylls. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are adapted for spore dispersal, which is a key feature of its life cycle. The plant exhibits interesting morphological adaptations that allow it to thrive in its specific ecological niche."
