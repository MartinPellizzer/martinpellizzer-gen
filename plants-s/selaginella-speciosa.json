    "intro": "Selaginella speciosa, commonly known as the Christmas moss, is a species of spore-producing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, thread-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stems. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Selaginella speciosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its unique appearance."
