    "intro": "Schwabea modesta, commonly known as the modest schwabea, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and sagebrush steppe habitats. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Schwabea modesta is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
