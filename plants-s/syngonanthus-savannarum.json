    "intro": "Syngonanthus savannarum, commonly known as the Florida panhandle ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. The plant features erect, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, pink to purple flowers in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Syngonanthus savannarum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators in its native range."
