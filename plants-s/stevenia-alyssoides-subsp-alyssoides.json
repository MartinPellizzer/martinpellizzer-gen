It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, and it has a compact, low-growing habit. Its leaves are hairy and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
