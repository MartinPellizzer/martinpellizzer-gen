    "intro": "Selago fruticulosa, commonly known as the coastal daisy or sea daisy, is a low-growing, flowering shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and strong winds, making it well adapted to maritime environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots help stabilize dunes and prevent erosion, contributing to coastal habitat preservation. Selago fruticulosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
