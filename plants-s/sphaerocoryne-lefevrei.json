    "intro": "Sphaerocoryne lefevrei, commonly known as the Lefevre's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive spherical, spiny seed heads that resemble small, hardened fruits. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often appearing in clusters at the base of the plant. Sphaerocoryne lefevrei plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for various small invertebrates."
