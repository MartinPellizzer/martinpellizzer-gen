    "intro": "Salix rigida var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple osier dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its striking purple-brown stems that become more intense with age, making it a popular ornamental plant. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow catkins in early spring, followed by white to pinkish flowers in late spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along streambanks and wetlands. Its fast growth rate and ability to tolerate wet conditions make it useful for erosion control and habitat restoration."
