    "intro": "Senecio tabulicola, commonly known as the African snowbush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
