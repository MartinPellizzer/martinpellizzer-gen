    "intro": "Saussurea glacialis, commonly known as the glacier saffron, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its fibrous roots help it anchor in nutrient-poor soils, while its dense foliage provides habitat for small alpine organisms. The plant's resilience to extreme climates makes it a symbol of the harsh beauty of mountain ecosystems."
