    "intro": "Sabicea bequaertii, commonly known as the Bequaert's sabicea, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in yellow or white. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its native range."
