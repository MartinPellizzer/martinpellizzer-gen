    "intro": "Saxifraga pseudopallida f. foliosa, commonly known as the leafy saxifrage, is a flowering plant species native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months. The plant features broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. This variant is distinguished by its more robust and leafy appearance compared to the typical form of Saxifraga pseudopallida."
