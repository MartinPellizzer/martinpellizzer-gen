    "intro": "Schizocaena arthropoda, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a unique morphology, featuring a single, slender stem with a rosette of broad, waxy leaves. Its flowers are showy, with white petals and a distinctive purple-tinged lip. Schizocaena arthropoda is known for its delicate appearance and is often considered a symbol of botanical rarity and ecological sensitivity."
