    "intro": "Sedum longifuniculatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems that can grow up to several feet in length, often branching out into a bushy form. The leaves are typically small, oval, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems, and bloom in late summer. This species is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
