    "intro": "Solanum aviculare var. acutifolium, commonly known as the sharp-leaved nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It features upright stems covered in fine, glandular hairs, and its leaves are lanceolate with serrated margins. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet, followed by round, fleshy berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but is of interest in botanical and ecological studies."
