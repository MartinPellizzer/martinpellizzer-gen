    "intro": "Steriphoma macranthum, commonly known as the large-flowered mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily inhabits the branches of certain host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to host trees. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it forms dense clusters on its hosts. Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of parasitic plant ecology and host-parasite relationships."
