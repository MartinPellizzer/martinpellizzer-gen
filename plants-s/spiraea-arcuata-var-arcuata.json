    "intro": "Spiraea arcuata var. arcuata, commonly known as meadow spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring arching stems that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are oval to lance-shaped, with a slightly serrated edge, and they turn yellow in the fall. Spiraea arcuata var. arcuata prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges."
