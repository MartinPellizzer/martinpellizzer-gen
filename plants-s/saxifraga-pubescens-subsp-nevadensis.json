It typically thrives in rocky, alpine environments, often found in meadows and open slopes at high elevations. The plant features dense, hairy foliage that helps protect it from harsh mountain conditions. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and clustered in umbels, adding a delicate touch to its rugged habitat. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its mountainous environment."
