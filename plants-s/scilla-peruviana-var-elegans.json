    "intro": "Scilla peruviana var. elegans, commonly known as the Peruvian squill, is a bulbous plant native to the Andes region of South America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
