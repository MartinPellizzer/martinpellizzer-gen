    "intro": "Schizopleura, commonly known as the glassy fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Onocleaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that give it a glass-like appearance, particularly when viewed in direct light. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Schizopleura has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spore-bearing structures. Its botanical features make it a fascinating subject for study in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
