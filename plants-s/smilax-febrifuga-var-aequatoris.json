    "intro": "Smilax febrifuga var. aequatoris, commonly known as the Ecuadorian fever vine, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the genus Smilax, which includes many species with similar morphological traits such as spiny stems and compound leaves. The plant is characterized by its long, woody tendrils and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for various wildlife. This variant is particularly noted for its medicinal properties, though it is less commonly used than other Smilax species."
