    "intro": "Sarcostemma annulare, commonly known as the ringed milkweed, is a climbing shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, milky sap and slender, twining stems. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy surface and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky parachutes, aiding in wind dispersal. Sarcostemma annulare is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
