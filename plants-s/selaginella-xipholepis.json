    "intro": "Selaginella xipholepis, commonly known as the spiky clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporophylls that bear spores, which are released during the dry season. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water. Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
