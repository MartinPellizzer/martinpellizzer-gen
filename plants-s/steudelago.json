It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds.

Botanically, they are valued for their potential medicinal properties and ecological roles in soil stabilization."
