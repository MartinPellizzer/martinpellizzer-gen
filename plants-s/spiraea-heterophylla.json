    "intro": "Spiraea heterophylla, commonly known as the variable spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with some leaves being narrow and others broader, depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers in early spring. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or streamside habitats. Spiraea heterophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to native pollinators."
