    "intro": "Saxifraga longifolia var. minor, commonly known as the lesser longstem saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
