    "intro": "Searsia ciliata, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal regions, characterized by its small, narrow leaves with fine hairs along the edges. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in winter, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its adaptability to sandy soils and coastal conditions makes it a hardy, drought-tolerant species. Searsia ciliata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in its native habitat."
