    "intro": "Salix alba var. chermesina, commonly known as the Weeping Willow, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive and elegant appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a bluish-green underside that adds to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and lakes. The plant is also notable for its early spring flowering, producing small, catkin-like flowers that attract pollinators."
