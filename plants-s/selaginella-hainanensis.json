    "intro": "Selaginella hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan spikemoss, is a rare and endangered vascular plant native to China's Hainan Island. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, spore-producing structures called strobila. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive strategy, with separate male and female gametophytes, and it retains its spores in specialized cones. Its morphology includes slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
