It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in rocky crevices. Its unique morphology includes distinctive leaf patterns and a short, erect stem. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
