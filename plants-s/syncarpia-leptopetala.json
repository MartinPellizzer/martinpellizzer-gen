    "intro": "Syncarpia leptopetala, commonly known as the slender-leaved sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to northern Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and fragrant, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces woody pods that contain small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Syncarpia leptopetala is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland heathlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
