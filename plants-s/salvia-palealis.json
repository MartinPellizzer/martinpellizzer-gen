    "intro": "Salvia palealis, commonly known as the pale sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale blue to lavender-colored flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Salvia palealis is also valued for its aromatic foliage and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
