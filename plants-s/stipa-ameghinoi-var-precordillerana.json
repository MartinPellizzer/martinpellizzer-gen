    "intro": "Stipa ameghinoi var. precordillerana, commonly known as the Precordillera needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. This variant is often found in open grasslands and along rocky outcrops in the Andean foothills."
