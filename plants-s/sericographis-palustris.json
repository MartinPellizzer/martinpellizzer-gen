    "intro": "Sericographis palustris, commonly known as the marsh fern, is a species of fern native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and swampy areas. Its spores are released in the form of small, brown clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Sericographis palustris plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland habitat."
