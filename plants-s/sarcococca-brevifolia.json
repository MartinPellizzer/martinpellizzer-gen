    "intro": "Sarcococca brevifolia, commonly known as the littleleaf sweetbox, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to China. It features dense, dark green foliage with small, ovate leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces fragrant, white, bell-shaped flowers in late winter or early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often used in hedges or rock gardens."
