    "intro": "Salix macnabiana, commonly known as Macnab's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate to cold climates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
