    "intro": "Sibthorpia repens, commonly known as the creeping sibthorpia, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
