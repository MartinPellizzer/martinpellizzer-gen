    "intro": "Solanum bifurcum, commonly known as the bifurcate nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into berries containing toxic seeds. It is characterized by its hairy stems and oval-shaped leaves. Due to its toxic properties, it is typically found in wild or semi-wild environments rather than cultivated gardens."
