    "intro": "Spartium laburnum, commonly known as yellow sweetclover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with oval-shaped leaflets and a distinctive, aromatic scent. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Spartium laburnum is also valued for its role in nitrogen fixation and as a forage crop for livestock."
