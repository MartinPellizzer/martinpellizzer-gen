It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically display a range of colors from white to pale yellow. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapting to its humid, shaded habitats. The orchid thrives in warm, moist environments and is often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight."
