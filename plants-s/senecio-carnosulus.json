    "intro": "Senecio carnosulus, commonly known as the Woolly Senecio, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a unique, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its overall look. It is a succulent, meaning it stores water in its leaves, making it drought-tolerant. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
