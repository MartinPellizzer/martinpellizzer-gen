    "intro": "Schaueria thyrsiflora, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a member of the Bignoniaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height, characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking clusters of orange-red tubular flowers during the dry season, which attract various pollinators. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in poor soil conditions. Schaueria thyrsiflora is often used in ornamental gardening due to its vibrant floral displays."
