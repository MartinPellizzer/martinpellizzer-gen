    "intro": "Saxifraga exarata subsp. pseudoexarata, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant has a rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and clustered in a dense inflorescence at the center of the rosette. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found at elevations above 7,000 feet."
