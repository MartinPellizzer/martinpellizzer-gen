    "intro": "Sciadophila, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns native to tropical and subtropical regions. It consists of several species, most of which are characterized by their delicate, lace-like fronds. The plants typically grow in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Sciadophila species have a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help in spreading vegetatively. Their reproductive structures, including sori, are usually located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns."
