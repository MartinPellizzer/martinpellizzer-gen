    "intro": "Specklinia determannii, commonly known as the Determann's speckled fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, speckled pattern of brown and green. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself to its host. The spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds."
