    "intro": "Sterculia urophylla, commonly known as the silky gum, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and lance-shaped, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Its fibrous bark and hard wood have historically been used by Indigenous Australians for various purposes. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native gardens."
