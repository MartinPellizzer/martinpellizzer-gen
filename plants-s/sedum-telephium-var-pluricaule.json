    "intro": "Sedum telephium var. pluricaule, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in rocky or gravelly soils, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
