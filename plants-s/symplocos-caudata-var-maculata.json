    "intro": "Symplocos caudata var. maculata, commonly known as the spotted evergreen holly, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often spotted with red or purple markings. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
