    "intro": "Selaginella spanielema, commonly known as the Spanish moss fern, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that form dense, mat-like structures on trees and rocks. This plant is typically found in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical and subtropical forests. Selaginella spanielema reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it has a unique ability to survive in dry conditions by entering a dormant state. Its vascular system allows it to efficiently transport water and nutrients, contributing to its adaptability in various ecological niches."
