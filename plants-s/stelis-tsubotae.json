    "intro": "Stelis tsubotae, commonly known as the Tsubota's spider orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid tropical environments. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of spider webs. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis tsubotae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and unique floral structure."
