    "intro": "Sarcochilus bigibbus, commonly known as the giant helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its large, helmet-shaped flower that can grow up to 15 centimeters in length. The plant features broad, strap-like leaves and produces a single, showy inflorescence with a distinctive, elongated floral structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Sarcochilus bigibbus is a rare and protected species, often found in specific microhabitats within its native range."
