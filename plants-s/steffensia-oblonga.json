    "intro": "Steffensia oblonga, commonly known as the narrowleaf steffensia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. Steffensia oblonga is typically found in rocky, high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
