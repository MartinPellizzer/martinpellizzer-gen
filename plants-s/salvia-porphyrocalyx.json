    "intro": "Salvia porphyrocalyx, commonly known as the purple calyx sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple calyces that surround its small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and produces showy blooms in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. Salvia porphyrocalyx is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to arid and semi-arid climates."
