    "intro": "Salix wangiana var. tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan willow, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of Tibet and adjacent areas. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, appearing in early spring, and it produces lightweight seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
