    "intro": "Solanum torricellense, commonly known as the Torricellense nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with simple, alternate leaves that are usually oval or elliptic in shape. Its flowers are small, usually white or pale green, and it produces small, yellowish berries that contain the toxic seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is not cultivated for food but is sometimes studied for its potential medicinal compounds."
