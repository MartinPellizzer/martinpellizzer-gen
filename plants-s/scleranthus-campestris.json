It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant has upright stems with spiny leaves and produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.
