    "intro": "Schoenus bracteosus, commonly known as the bracteated bulbous grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it forms dense clusters of grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish itself in moist soils. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
