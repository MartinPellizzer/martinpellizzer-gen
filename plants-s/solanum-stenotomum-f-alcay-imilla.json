    "intro": "Solanum stenotomum f. alcay-imilla, commonly known as the Alcay-Imilla nightshade, is a rare botanical variant native to specific regions in South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. This variant is characterized by its unique leaf morphology and striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically toxic but hold ecological significance for local fauna. Its limited distribution and distinctive features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
