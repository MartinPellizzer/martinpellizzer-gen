    "intro": "Seymeria madrensis, commonly known as the Madrensis seymaria, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant yellow flowers. The plant produces small, tubular blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Seymeria madrensis thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected natural reserves."
