    "intro": "Stachys rigida subsp. rigida, commonly known as rigid hedge nettle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems covered with stiff, glandular hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale purple to white flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have a strong, minty scent when crushed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along streambanks."
