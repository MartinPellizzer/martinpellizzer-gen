    "intro": "Setaria javana, commonly known as Java millet, is an annual grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
