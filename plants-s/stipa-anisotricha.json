    "intro": "Stipa anisotricha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, awned florets. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and steppe environments. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it valuable for erosion control. Stipa anisotricha is also appreciated for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
