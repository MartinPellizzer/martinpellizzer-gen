    "intro": "Sabicea colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian sabicea, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the Leguminosae family, also known as the legume or pea family, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds, a common reproductive strategy among legumes. Sabicea colombiana is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, humid climate. Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of tropical flora and ecological diversity."
