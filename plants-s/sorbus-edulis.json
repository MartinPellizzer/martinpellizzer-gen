    "intro": "Sorbus edulis, commonly known as the edible rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, yellow-orange berries that are edible when ripe. The plant produces pinnate leaves with serrated edges and small, white flowers in spring. Its fruits are typically consumed by birds and mammals, aiding in seed dispersal. The tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
