    "intro": "Stobaea carlinifolia, commonly known as the Carlin's spurge, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
