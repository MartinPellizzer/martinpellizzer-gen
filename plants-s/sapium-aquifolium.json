    "intro": "Sapium aquifolium, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps repel water. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom above the water surface, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize water sediments and improve water quality. Sapium aquifolium is also valued for its ornamental beauty and cultural significance in many Asian traditions."
