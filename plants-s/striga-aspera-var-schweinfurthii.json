    "intro": "Striga aspera var. schweinfurthii, commonly known as the African witchweed, is a parasitic plant native to sub-Saharan Africa. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is notable for its ability to parasitize a wide range of host plants, including important agricultural crops. The plant has a slender, branched stem and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, and it produces small, dry fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant yield losses in crops such as maize and sorghum."
