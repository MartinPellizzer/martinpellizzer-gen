It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are alternate and ciliate, with fine hairs along the edges, contributing to its common name. It is a herbaceous perennial that plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environments."
