    "intro": "Solanum dulcamara var. heterophyllum, commonly known as climbing nightshade, is a perennial vine native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves that are usually a deep green. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in summer, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It is often found in damp, shady areas such as woodlands and along stream banks. This species is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans."
