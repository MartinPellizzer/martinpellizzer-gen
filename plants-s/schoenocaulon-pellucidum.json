    "intro": "Schoenocaulon pellucidum, commonly known as the translucent sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features a dense mat of succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its root system is adapted to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. Schoenocaulon pellucidum is well-suited to coastal climates and is often found in dunes and rocky outcrops."
