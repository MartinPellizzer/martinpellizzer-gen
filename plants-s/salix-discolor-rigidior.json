    "intro": "Salix discolor rigidior, commonly known as the rigid willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often rigid branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
