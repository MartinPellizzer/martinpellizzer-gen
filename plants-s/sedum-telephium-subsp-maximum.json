    "intro": "Sedum telephium subsp. maximum, commonly known as the large-flowered stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers in summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
