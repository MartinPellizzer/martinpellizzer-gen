    "intro": "Styrax platanifolius subsp. mollis, commonly known as the soft-leaved styrax, is a species of flowering plant in the family Styracaceae. It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that are typically soft to the touch, giving it its subspecific name. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, red, fleshy fruits. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in the coastal plains of Georgia and South Carolina. This species is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and pleasant scent."
