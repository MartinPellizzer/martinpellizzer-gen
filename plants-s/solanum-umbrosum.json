    "intro": "Solanum umbrosum, commonly known as the shadowplant, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. The plant is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and small, violet flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a globose berry that turns from green to yellow as it matures. Solanum umbrosum is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability to shady environments."
