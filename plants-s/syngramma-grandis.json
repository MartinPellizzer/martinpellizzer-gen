    "intro": "Syngramma grandis, commonly known as the large green orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and grasslands. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor in the soil while absorbing nutrients. Syngramma grandis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
