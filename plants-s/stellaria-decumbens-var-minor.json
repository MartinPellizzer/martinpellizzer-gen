    "intro": "Stellaria decumbens var. minor, commonly known as lesser starwort, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that often lie close to the ground, producing small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. This plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetland areas. Its flowering period generally occurs in late spring to early summer, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
