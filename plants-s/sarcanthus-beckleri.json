    "intro": "Sarcanthus beckleri, commonly known as the Beckler's sarcanthus, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on specific microclimatic conditions. Its foliage is often covered in fine, silky hairs, which may aid in moisture retention and protection from herbivores. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sarcanthus beckleri is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
