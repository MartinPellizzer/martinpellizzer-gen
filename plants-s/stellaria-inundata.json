    "intro": "Stellaria inundata, commonly known as water starwort, is a small, herbaceous annual plant native to wetland and aquatic environments. It has slender, branching stems that often grow close to the water's surface. Its small, white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant's leaves are narrow and linear, often floating or submerged depending on the water level. It plays a role in stabilizing aquatic soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
