    "intro": "Schizoglossum altissimum, commonly known as the tall marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant produces tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, arranged in dense spikes, and bloom in late summer. Schizoglossum altissimum plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
