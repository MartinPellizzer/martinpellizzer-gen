    "intro": "Saxifraga, commonly known as stonecrop, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Saxifragaceae. These plants are typically found in rocky or alpine environments, where they thrive in well-drained soils. Saxifraga species are characterized by their succulent leaves and clusters of small, often brightly colored flowers. They are often used in rock gardens due to their hardiness and aesthetic appeal. Many species are adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh conditions."
