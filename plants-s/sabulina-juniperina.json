    "intro": "Sabulina juniperina, commonly known as the Juniperine Sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse its seeds. Sabulina juniperina plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
