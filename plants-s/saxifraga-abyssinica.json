    "intro": "Saxifraga abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, adapting to the harsh conditions of its alpine environment. Its flowers, which are usually pink or white, bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and delicate species."
