    "intro": "Sinobambusa scabrida, commonly known as the scaly bamboo, is a species of flowering bamboo native to China. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems covered in a rough, scaly texture that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale yellow flowers, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its leaves are narrow and have a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Sinobambusa scabrida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to a variety of soil types in its natural habitat."
