It is characterized by its long, narrow fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and establish new colonies. Its leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
