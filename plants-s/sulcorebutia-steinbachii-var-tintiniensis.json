    "intro": "Sulcorebutia steinbachii var. tintiniensis, commonly known as the Tintini's sun rose, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to South America. It features dense clusters of cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces showy, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the warmer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens and requires well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and compact size, it is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
