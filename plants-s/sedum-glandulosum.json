    "intro": "Sedum glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to rocky and arid environments in North America. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it drought-tolerant. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
