    "intro": "Schizoglossum aemulatum, commonly known as the mimic orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, often showy flowers that resemble other orchid species. The plant has a short, fibrous root system and produces small, green leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy layer. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink and are arranged in clusters, making it a distinctive addition to alpine flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Schizoglossum aemulatum is considered a rare and endangered species."
