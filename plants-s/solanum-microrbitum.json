    "intro": "Solanum microrbitum, commonly known as the tiny orbit tomato, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically red when mature, similar to other members of the Solanum genus. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a slightly hairy texture, and it has a compact growth habit. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
