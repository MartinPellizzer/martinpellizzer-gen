    "intro": "Salix donggouxianica, commonly known as the Donggou Xiaxian willow, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments, such as riverbanks and wetlands. Its flowers are catkins, which are typical of willow species, and it produces small, winged seeds for dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
