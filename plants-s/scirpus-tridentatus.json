    "intro": "Scirpus tridentatus, commonly known as the three-toothed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It typically grows to a height of 60 to 120 centimeters, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves that are often reddish or purple at the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense spikes, which are usually green or brown in color. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and improve water filtration in wetland ecosystems. Scirpus tridentatus is an important component of wetland habitats, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
