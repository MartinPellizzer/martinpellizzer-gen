    "intro": "Salix prunifolia, commonly known as the cherry willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and small, oval leaves that are often pinkish or red in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its flowers, typically in the spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian habitats. Salix prunifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
