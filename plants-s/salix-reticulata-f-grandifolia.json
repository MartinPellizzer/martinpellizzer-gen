    "intro": "Salix reticulata f. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered weeping willow, is a cultivar of the weeping willow species. It is characterized by its long, cascading branches that create a striking, flowing appearance. The plant produces small, yellow catkins in early spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive cycle. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a silvery-white underside, adding to its ornamental value. This variety is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in moist environments."
