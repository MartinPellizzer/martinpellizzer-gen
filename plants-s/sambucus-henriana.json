    "intro": "Sambucus henriana, commonly known as the Japanese elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features compound leaves with 5\u20137 leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible when fully ripe but contain seeds that can be toxic if consumed in large quantities. Sambucus henriana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
