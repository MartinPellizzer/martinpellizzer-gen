    "intro": "Sicyos mawhai, commonly known as the Mawhai vine, is a climbing plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its tendrils that help it climb towards sunlight. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and it is often found in coastal and forested areas. Sicyos mawhai plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various insects and birds."
