    "intro": "Stellularia media var. foecunda, commonly known as the narrowleaf starworts, is a perennial herb native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It has slender, upright stems that are often branched and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy surface that helps retain moisture. This variety is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams."
