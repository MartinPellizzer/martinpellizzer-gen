    "intro": "Solanum mammosum var. corniculum, commonly known as the horned nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive horn-like protrusions on the fruit and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into fleshy, orange-red berries. The berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic compounds, making them dangerous if consumed in large quantities. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
