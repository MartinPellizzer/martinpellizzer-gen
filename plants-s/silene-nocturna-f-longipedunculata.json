    "intro": "Silene nocturna f. longipedunculata, commonly known as the long pedunculate evening primrose, is a botanical variant of the evening primrose species. It is characterized by its elongated peduncles, which bear clusters of pale yellow to white flowers that open at dusk. The plant typically grows in sandy or loamy soils in open habitats such as fields and roadsides. Its flowers have four petals and are pollinated primarily by nocturnal insects like moths. The foliage consists of lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, adapting to its semi-arid environment."
