    "intro": "Sooia ulugurica, commonly known as the Uluguru sooty spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Uluguru Mountains in Tanzania. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and often spiny foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within the montane forest ecosystems. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in complex inflorescences, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
