    "intro": "Symplocos laeteviridis var. basirotunda, commonly known as the smoothleaf evergreen holly, is a shrub characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on both sides. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. It is native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The leaves have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss, and the plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Its botanical features make it well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates."
