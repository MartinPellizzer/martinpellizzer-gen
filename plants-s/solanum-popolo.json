It is native to the Andean region of South America and is characterized by its tuberous roots that develop a deep purple color. The plant typically grows in cool, high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. Its leaves are ovate with a hairy texture, and it produces small, white flowers that develop into berries. The tubers are rich in nutrients and have been traditionally used for both culinary and medicinal purposes."
