    "intro": "Salvia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It features upright, branched stems covered with greyish-white, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Salvia parvifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and dry landscapes."
