    "intro": "Sphaeranthus neglectus, commonly known as the common sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing annual herb with a mat-forming habit, often found in disturbed soils and sandy environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a globular inflorescence, which gives it its genus name \"Sphaeranthus,\" meaning \"sphere-bearing.\" Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water conservation. The species is adapted to thrive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
