    "intro": "Sabia puberula, commonly known as the hairy sabia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its humid habitat. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with five petals and a prominent central stigma. Sabia puberula is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
