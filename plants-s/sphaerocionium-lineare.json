It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and small, clustered white flowers. Native to southern Africa, this plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant has a taproot system and produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
