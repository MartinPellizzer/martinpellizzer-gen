    "intro": "Solanum eardleyae, commonly known as the Eardley's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or white. The plant produces small, yellow or orange berries that contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
