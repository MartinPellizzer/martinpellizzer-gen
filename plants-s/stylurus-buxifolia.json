    "intro": "Stylurus buxifolia, commonly known as the boxleaf stylurus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves that resemble those of boxwood. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are often borne in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
