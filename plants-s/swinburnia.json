    "intro": "Swinburnia, commonly known as the swamp willow, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Salicaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to wetland habitats in the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are characterized by their opposite, often simple leaves and catkin-like inflorescences. Swinburnia species typically grow in moist, acidic soils and are often found along stream banks and in swamps. They play an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
