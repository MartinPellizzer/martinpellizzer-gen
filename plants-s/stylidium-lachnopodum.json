    "intro": "Stylidium lachnopodum, commonly known as the sticky bladder orchid, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its unique, inflated, bladder-like flowers that are often covered in a sticky substance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and sand dunes. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the sticky secretion may play a role in attracting or trapping pollinators. The species is part of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is known for its specialized morphology and ecological adaptations."
