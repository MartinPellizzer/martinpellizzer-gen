    "intro": "Senna rigida, commonly known as the rigid senna, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. Its seeds are encased in narrow, curved pods that split open to release the seeds. Senna rigida is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
