It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, showy blooms that come in various shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid environments. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Sicana fragrans is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its subtle, intoxicating fragrance."
