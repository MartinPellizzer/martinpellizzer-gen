    "intro": "Sedum caesium, commonly known as the blue stonecrop, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a succulent species with fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer. It grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and mountain habitats. Sedum caesium is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in difficult conditions."
