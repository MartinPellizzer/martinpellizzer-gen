    "intro": "Sphinctanthus insignis, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in poor soil and withstand drought conditions. Sphinctanthus insignis is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
