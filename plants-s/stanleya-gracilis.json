    "intro": "Stanleya gracilis, commonly known as the slender Stanleya, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, such as meadows and slopes, and is adapted to arid conditions. Its slender stems and small, yellowish flowers are typical of the genus Stanleya. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation in semi-arid environments."
