    "intro": "Saxifraga forbesii, commonly known as the Forbes' saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Saxifraga forbesii is often found in mountainous areas and tundra environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
