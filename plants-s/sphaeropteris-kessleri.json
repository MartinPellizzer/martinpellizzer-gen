    "intro": "Sphaeropteris kessleri, commonly known as the Kessler's cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often bright green. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical climates and requires well-drained soil and ample sunlight. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
