    "intro": "Sida velutina, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Sida velutina is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
