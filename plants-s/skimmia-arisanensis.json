    "intro": "Skimmia arisanensis, commonly known as the Japanese skimmia, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan and Taiwan. It features dark green, elliptical leaves that turn reddish in the fall, adding visual interest to the landscape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late winter or early spring, followed by orange-red berries that persist through the winter. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Skimmia arisanensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
