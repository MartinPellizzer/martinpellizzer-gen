    "intro": "Stephanopappus reflexus, commonly known as the bentleaf groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually oblanceolate with a distinctive reflexed (bent back) tip, giving it its scientific name. It produces small yellow flowers that are followed by fluffy, white pappus structures that aid in wind dispersal of its seeds."
