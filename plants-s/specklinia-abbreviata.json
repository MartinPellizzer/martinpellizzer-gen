    "intro": "Specklinia abbreviata, commonly known as the short-stemmed orchid, is a species of terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered pseudobulbs. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Specklinia abbreviata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
