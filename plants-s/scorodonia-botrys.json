The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and prefers full sun exposure. Scorodonia botrys is often found in rocky or coastal environments, where it demonstrates a high degree of drought tolerance. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
