    "intro": "Stephanandra incisa, commonly known as the Chinese beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright purple berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. The plant has opposite, simple, and ovate leaves that turn red in the fall. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its unique berries and seasonal color changes contribute to its aesthetic appeal in landscaped settings."
