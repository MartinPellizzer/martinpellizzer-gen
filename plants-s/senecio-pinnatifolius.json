It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and narrow, pinnately divided leaves. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in arid regions."
