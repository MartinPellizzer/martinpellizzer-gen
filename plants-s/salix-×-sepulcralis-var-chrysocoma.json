    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 sepulcralis var. chrysocoma, commonly known as the golden willow, is a hybrid willow species native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow catkins and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and wetlands. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, which are followed by elongated, fluffy seeds. The golden willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian environments."
