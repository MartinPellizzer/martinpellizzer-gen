    "intro": "Streptocarpus teitensis, commonly known as the Mascarene streptocarpus, is a flowering plant native to the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically produces violet or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a contrasting white or yellow throat. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Streptocarpus teitensis is appreciated for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
