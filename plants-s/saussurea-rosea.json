    "intro": "Saussurea rosea, commonly known as the Chinese snow lotus, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Tibet. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and clusters of pale purple or white flowers. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to survive in extreme altitudes. Its rhizomes are valued in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species."
