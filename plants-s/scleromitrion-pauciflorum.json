    "intro": "Scleromitrion pauciflorum, commonly known as the few-flowered rockrose, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, often clustered leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its flowers are typically tubular and are adapted for pollination by insects, particularly bees. Scleromitrion pauciflorum is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is known for its resilience in harsh, rocky habitats."
