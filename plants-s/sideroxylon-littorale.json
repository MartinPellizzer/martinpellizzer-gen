The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are usually pubescent, and it produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Sideroxylon littorale is often found in mangrove and coastal forest ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various species. Its botanical features make it an important component of coastal biodiversity."
