    "intro": "Sclerochiton apiculatus, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsule fruits containing seeds. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, which contributes to its common name. Sclerochiton apiculatus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
