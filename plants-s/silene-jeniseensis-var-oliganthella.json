    "intro": "Silene jeniseensis var. oliganthella, commonly known as the rare Mongolian catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mongolia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
