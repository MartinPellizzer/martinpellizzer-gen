    "intro": "Sarcaulus vestitus, commonly known as the velvet moss, is a member of the family Sphagnaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate and boreal forests. The plant has a dark green to reddish-brown stem covered in a thick, velvety layer of vegetative cells. Its sporophytes are small and inconspicuous, with a capsule that produces spores for reproduction. Sarcaulus vestitus plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat."
