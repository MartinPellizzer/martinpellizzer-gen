It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and purple. Its botanical characteristics include a hairy stem and small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
