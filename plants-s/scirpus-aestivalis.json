    "intro": "Scirpus aestivalis, commonly known as the summer bulrush, is a tall, reed-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces clustered, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, three-lobed flowers. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported diuretic properties. Scirpus aestivalis plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
