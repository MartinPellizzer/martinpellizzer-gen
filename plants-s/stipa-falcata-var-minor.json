    "intro": "Stipa falcata var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf basket grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, arching stems that produce dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often used in ornamental gardening due to their delicate appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to both ecological and horticultural landscapes."
