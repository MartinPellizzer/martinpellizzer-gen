    "intro": "Selaginella digitata, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, ground-covering plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant features a short, upright stem with whorls of spirally arranged, needle-like leaves. Selaginella digitata is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and for its unique reproductive structures called strobila. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms."
