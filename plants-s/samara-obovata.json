    "intro": "Samara obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate samara, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive samara fruits, which are dry, winged seeds that aid in wind dispersal. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and prefers well-drained soil. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a smooth margin, and it produces small white or pink flowers in the spring. Samara obovata is often found in woodland edges and open areas, contributing to local biodiversity."
