    "intro": "Scirpus strobilifer, commonly known as the spike rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae and is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence composed of spikelets. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its stems are often hollow and wiry. Scirpus strobilifer produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil retention and habitat creation for various aquatic organisms."
