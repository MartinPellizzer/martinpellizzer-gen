    "intro": "Solanum acaule var. caulescens, commonly known as the naked stem nightshade, is a variant of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) characterized by its unique morphology. It is distinguished by its lack of a true stem, with leaves directly emerging from the base, giving it a clustered appearance. The plant typically produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are often white or pale blue in color. Its fruits are berries that mature to a deep purple or black, containing several seeds. This variant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in shaded, moist environments."
