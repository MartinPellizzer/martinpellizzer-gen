    "intro": "Salix rubra, commonly known as red willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive reddish-brown bark that becomes flaky with age. The leaves are oval to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a smooth, dark green upper surface. It produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination, and its flowers are wind-pollinated. This species is often found in moist habitats such as stream banks and wet meadows."
