    "intro": "Sphaeropteris capitata, commonly known as the dwarf cyclosorus, is a compact fern native to Southeast Asia. It features a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, clustered fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that give the plant a dense, bushy appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in tropical gardens."
