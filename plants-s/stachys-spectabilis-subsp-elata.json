    "intro": "Stachys spectabilis subsp. elata, commonly known as tall hedge nettle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves with a serrated margin, and it produces small, hairy fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
