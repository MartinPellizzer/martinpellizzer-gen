    "intro": "Salix nakamurana f. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a botanical variant of the Nakamura willow. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan, characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as riverbanks and mountainous regions. Its foliage is often a deep green, and it produces catkins in early spring. This form is notable for its unique leaf morphology, which distinguishes it from other Salix species."
