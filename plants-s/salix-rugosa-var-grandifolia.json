    "intro": "Salix rugosa var. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendulous branches that create a weeping appearance, and its leaves are ovate with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive biology. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate regions."
