    "intro": "Sorbus aria f. hungarica, commonly known as the Hungarian whitebeam, is a rare and distinctive subspecies of the whitebeam tree. It is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters, followed by small, red berries that mature in the fall. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a serrated margin and a slightly hairy texture. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
