    "intro": "Saxifraga montana f. humilis, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with a waxy coating, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
