    "intro": "Stellaria media var. trichocalyx, commonly known as hairy chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant its \"hairy\" appearance. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, lawns, and along pathways. This variant is closely related to the common chickweed but is distinguished by its dense pubescence."
