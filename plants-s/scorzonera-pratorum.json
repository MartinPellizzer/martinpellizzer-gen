    "intro": "Scorzonera pratorum, commonly known as the meadow scorzonera, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Compositae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of elongated, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers with prominent yellow centers. The plant typically grows in dry meadows and rocky soils across Europe and parts of Asia. Its root system is fibrous and can reach considerable depth, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor environments. Scorzonera pratorum is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered a perennial species."
