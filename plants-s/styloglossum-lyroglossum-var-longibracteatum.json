    "intro": "Styloglossum lyroglossum var. longibracteatum, commonly known as the long-bract styloglossum, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring elongated bracts that enclose the inflorescence. The plant exhibits a succulent habit, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its often arid or seasonally dry habitat. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pale yellow. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
