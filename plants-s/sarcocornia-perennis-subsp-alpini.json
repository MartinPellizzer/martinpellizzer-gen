It is a shrub-like perennial with succulent leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in coastal and inland saline soils, often found in salt marshes and dunes. Its fleshy stems and leaves store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert and coastal species."
