    "intro": "Selinum afghanicum, commonly known as Afghan tansy, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-like flower clusters. It is native to Central Asia and thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in rocky soils. The plant has finely divided, feathery leaves that emit a strong, camphor-like scent when crushed. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in compound umbels, and it blooms during the summer months. Selinum afghanicum is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies for its purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory effects."
