It is a member of the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink or purple flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and branched. Scabiosa pratensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
