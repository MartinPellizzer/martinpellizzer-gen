    "intro": "Spiraea canescens var. glaucophylla, commonly known as the glaucophylla spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically gray-green in color, giving the plant a distinctive, silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a border plant. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in colder climates."
