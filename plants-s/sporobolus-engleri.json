    "intro": "Sporobolus engleri, commonly known as Engler's needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and its seeds are dispersed by wind due to the presence of specialized structures called awns. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with low nutrient soils. Sporobolus engleri plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
