    "intro": "Synaedrys dalbertisii, commonly known as the Dalbert's ghost fern, is a species of fern native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are short and produce a dense network of roots that help anchor it to rocky substrates. The fronds are biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile ones in the second."
