    "intro": "Selaginella rugulosa, commonly known as the zigzag spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, needle-like leaves that are often twisted or zigzagged, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporophyte stage produces spores on specialized leaves called sporophylls. Selaginella rugulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
