    "intro": "Salix nigricans subsp. borealis, commonly known as the northern black willow, is a shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as riverbanks and marshes, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has slender, often drooping branches and produces catkin-like inflorescences that are characteristic of willow species. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture and a distinct reddish or purple hue on the underside. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in riparian zones."
