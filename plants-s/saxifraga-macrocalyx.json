It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, silver-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, white or pinkish flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Saxifraga macrocalyx is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
