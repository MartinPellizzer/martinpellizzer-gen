    "intro": "Strychnos baculum, commonly known as the \"bottle tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Loganiaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. The plant is characterized by its unique, bottle-shaped trunk and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Strychnos baculum produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
