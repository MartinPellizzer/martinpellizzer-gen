    "intro": "Silene scouleri var. eglandulosa, commonly known as the glandless Indian paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and meadows. The plant produces showy, red-orange bracts that resemble paintbrushes, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. This variety is distinguished by the absence of glandular structures on its stems and leaves, giving it its varietal name."
