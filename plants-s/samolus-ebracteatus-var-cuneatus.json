    "intro": "Samolus ebracteatus var. cuneatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to sandy and coastal environments. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It has a compact growth habit, with stems that often lie close to the ground. This plant is well adapted to coastal and dune ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
