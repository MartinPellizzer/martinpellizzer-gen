It is characterized by its thick, woody trunk and two large, leathery leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for over 1,500 years, making it one of the oldest living plants. It is adapted to extreme arid conditions, relying on fog and dew for moisture. Its distinctive morphology and resilience make it a key species in its ecosystem."
