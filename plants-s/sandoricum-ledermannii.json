It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils. Its leaves are elliptical and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Sandoricum ledermannii is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
