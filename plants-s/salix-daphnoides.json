    "intro": "Salix daphnoides, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and have a soft, fuzzy texture. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. This plant is often found near water sources and is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
