    "intro": "Stenosiphonium russelianum var. subsericeum, commonly known as the narrow-sheath grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in areas with high humidity and consistent moisture. Its botanical structure includes a fibrous root system and culms that are often\u4e1b\u751f (clumped) in growth habit. This variety is distinguished by its subsericeous (slightly silky) leaf surfaces, which contribute to its unique appearance."
