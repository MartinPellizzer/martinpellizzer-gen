    "intro": "Selliguea nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or tree trunks. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a dorsiventral leaf-like body that is often covered in small, scale-like structures. It produces sporangia on specialized stalks, which release spores for reproduction. Selliguea nepalensis is found in temperate regions, particularly in the Himalayas, and plays a role in soil stabilization and ecological balance in its habitat."
