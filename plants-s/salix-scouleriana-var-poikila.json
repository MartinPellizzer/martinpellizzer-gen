It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks. Due to its adaptability and ecological importance, it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
