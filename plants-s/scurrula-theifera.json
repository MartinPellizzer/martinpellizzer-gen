    "intro": "Scurrula theifera, commonly known as the thief's lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its leaf-like thallus that is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found growing on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate and tropical regions. Scurrula theifera is notable for its ability to thrive in shaded environments and its historical association with folklore."
