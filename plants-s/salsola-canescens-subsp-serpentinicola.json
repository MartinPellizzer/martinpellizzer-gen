    "intro": "Salsola canescens subsp. serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to grow in saline and calcareous soils. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of greenish-white flowers. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. This subspecies is particularly notable for its ability to thrive on serpentine soils, which are typically low in essential nutrients and high in toxic metals."
