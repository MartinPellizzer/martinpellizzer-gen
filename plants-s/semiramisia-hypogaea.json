    "intro": "Semiramisia hypogaea, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that grows low to the ground, with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that open in the morning and close by midday. Its seeds are encased in a fleshy, edible pod that splits open when mature. Semiramisia hypogaea is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water availability."
