    "intro": "Schoenoplectiella supina, commonly known as the flat-topped sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters with slender, triangular stems. The plant produces small, greenish-brown flowers arranged in a flat, spike-like inflorescence, which is characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Schoenoplectiella supina plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
