    "intro": "Schismatoglottis multiflora, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a terrestrial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with showy, orchid-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its leaves are usually broad and elliptical, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Schismatoglottis multiflora thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
