    "intro": "Sedum americanum, commonly known as American stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to North America. It features fleshy, upright stems and opposite, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a drought-tolerant ornamental plant. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in harsh, arid environments."
