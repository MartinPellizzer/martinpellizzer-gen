    "intro": "Schizachyrium radicosum, commonly known as little bluestem, is a native North American grass species that thrives in a variety of soil types, including sandy and clay soils. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage that turns coppery in the fall, and its slender, flowering stems that produce small, spike-like inflorescences. This perennial plant is drought-tolerant and often found in prairies, open woodlands, and disturbed sites. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife. Schizachyrium radicosum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in native plant gardens."
