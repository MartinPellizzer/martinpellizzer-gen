    "intro": "Sorbus picta, commonly known as the painted ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking, ornamental foliage that turns vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by clusters of red berries that persist into winter. Its bark is smooth and gray, with shallow fissures, and it can grow up to 30 feet tall. Sorbus picta is valued in landscaping for its seasonal color changes and adaptability to various soil conditions."
