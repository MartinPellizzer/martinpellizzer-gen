    "intro": "Strychnos melanocarpa, commonly known as the black strychnos, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its dark, woody fruit pods that contain yellowish seeds. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in terminal panicles. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture with serrated edges. The species is notable for containing toxic alkaloids, such as strychnine, which have historically been used in medicinal and toxicological contexts."
