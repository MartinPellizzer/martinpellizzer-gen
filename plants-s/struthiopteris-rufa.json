    "intro": "Struthiopteris rufa, commonly known as the red fern, is a species of polypod fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically reddish-brown when young and turn dark green as they mature. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. Struthiopteris rufa plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
