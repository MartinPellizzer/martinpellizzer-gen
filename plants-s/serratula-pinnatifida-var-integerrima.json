    "intro": "Serratula pinnatifida var. integerrima, commonly known as the tall golden ragwort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with purple. The plant produces tall, branching stems that bear yellow-green composite flowers arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a noxious weed in some areas."
