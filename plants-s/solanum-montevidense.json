    "intro": "Solanum montevidense, commonly known as the Montevidense nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Uruguay and parts of Brazil. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, and its fruit is a red, fleshy berry that contains several seeds. It is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for food but is of interest in botanical studies."
