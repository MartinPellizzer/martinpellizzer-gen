    "intro": "Salsola richteri var. androssowii, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and small, fleshy, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in summer. Its roots are extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils. This species is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
