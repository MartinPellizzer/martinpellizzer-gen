    "intro": "Serratula deltoides, commonly known as the delta sow-thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lobed, fleshy leaves and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine. Serratula deltoides thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a common weed and a valuable plant in ecological studies."
