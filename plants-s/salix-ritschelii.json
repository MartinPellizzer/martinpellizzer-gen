    "intro": "Salix ritschelii, commonly known as the Ritschel willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern South America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, elongated leaves that are typically green on top and whitish underneath. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind, and its bark is often smooth with a reddish or grayish hue. Salix ritschelii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along streams. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
