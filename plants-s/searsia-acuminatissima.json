    "intro": "Searsia acuminatissima, commonly known as the sour fig or wild fig, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Rubiacae family and is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with 5 to 7 leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by edible, greenish-white berries. These berries are often consumed by birds and mammals, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
