    "intro": "Sisymbrium scholare, commonly known as the yellow rocket, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom from spring to early summer. Its seeds are small and can be dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize various habitats. Sisymbrium scholare is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators."
