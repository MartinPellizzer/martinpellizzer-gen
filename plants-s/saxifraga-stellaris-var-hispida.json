    "intro": "Saxifraga stellaris var. hispida, commonly known as the hairy star saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe. It features compact, rosette-forming leaves that are densely covered with fine, hairy pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its succulent leaves and stems allow it to store water, adapting it to nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. This variety is often found in mountainous regions, where it thrives in full sun and cool temperatures."
