It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in salt marshes and dunes. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are densely packed, giving it a thick, cushion-like appearance. Its flowers are typically white or pink, with five petals, and bloom in early spring. It is well adapted to harsh coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
