    "intro": "Saxifraga sessiliflora, commonly known as the rockfoam, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense cushions or mats, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or silver hair, providing some protection from intense sunlight and cold. Its flowers are usually pink or white, clustered in tight, rounded inflorescences, and bloom in late summer. Saxifraga sessiliflora is well adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, making it a common sight in mountainous and tundra habitats."
