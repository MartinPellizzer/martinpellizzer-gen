    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 guinieri, commonly known as the weeping willow hybrid, is a deciduous tree or shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It is a natural hybrid between Salix alba (white willow) and Salix babylonica (Babylonian willow), resulting in its distinctive cascading branches. The plant is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with yellow or reddish hues in the fall. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies, making it a common sight in wetland environments. Its rapid growth and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for landscaping, though it can be invasive in some regions."
