    "intro": "Saxifraga incurva, commonly known as the bent-leaved saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often curled or bent at the edges. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer, typically clustered at the center of the leaf rosette. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, humid environments. Saxifraga incurva is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
