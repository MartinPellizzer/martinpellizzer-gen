    "intro": "Silene verecunda subsp. andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson's campion, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, often in rocky or gravelly soils. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
