    "intro": "Selaginella leveriana, commonly known as the basket fern, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spore-bearing structures called strobila. It is a vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that form dense mats. Its leaves are usually arranged in a spiral pattern, and the plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Selaginella leveriana is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
