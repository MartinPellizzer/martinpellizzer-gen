    "intro": "Solidago lanceolata var. major, commonly known as the Showy Goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer and early autumn. The leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. This variety is often found in open woods, meadows, and disturbed sites, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its showy inflorescences make it a popular choice for garden cultivation and a vital source of nectar for pollinators."
