    "intro": "Styphelia sprengelioides, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color, arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers during the spring and early summer, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires partial to full shade, making it well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover in shaded woodland areas. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
