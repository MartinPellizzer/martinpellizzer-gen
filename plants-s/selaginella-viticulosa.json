    "intro": "Selaginella viticulosa, commonly known as the basket fern, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant features small, scale-like leaves arranged in a compact rosette pattern, which helps retain moisture. Its sporophytes produce spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are typically found at the base of the plant. Selaginella viticulosa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to tolerate low light conditions."
