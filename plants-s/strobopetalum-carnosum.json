    "intro": "Strobopetalum carnosum, commonly known as the fat-leafed bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to drought conditions. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is valued in both horticultural and ecological contexts."
