    "intro": "Selenipedium longifolium var. gracile, commonly known as the slender-leaved giant pteridium, is a rare and striking fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length, with a distinct, elongated shape. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically clustered on the undersides of its fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in dense forests or along riverbanks. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
