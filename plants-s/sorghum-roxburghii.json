    "intro": "Sorghum roxburghii, commonly known as wild sorghum, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species with drought tolerance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its seeds are small and encased in a thin hull. Sorghum roxburghii is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock."
