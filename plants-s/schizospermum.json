    "intro": "Schizospermum, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Anacardiaceae. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its woody, often thorny stems and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, and the fruits are follicles that split open to release seeds. Schizospermum species are known for their latex, which can be milky and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for ornamental purposes due to their unique foliage and resilience."
