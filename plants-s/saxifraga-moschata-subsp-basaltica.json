    "intro": "Saxifraga moschata subsp. basaltica, commonly known as the basalt saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh mountainous regions. Its subspecific name, *basaltica*, refers to its frequent occurrence in basaltic rock formations."
