    "intro": "Spartina glabra, commonly known as saltgrass, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of North America. It is a perennial grass that thrives in saline and brackish wetlands, often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that contain tiny flowers. Spartina glabra plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its ability to tolerate high salinity and periodic flooding makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
