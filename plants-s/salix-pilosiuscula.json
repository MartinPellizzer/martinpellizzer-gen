    "intro": "Salix pilosiuscula, commonly known as the silky willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive silvery-gray bark. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a soft, fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Salix pilosiuscula is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
