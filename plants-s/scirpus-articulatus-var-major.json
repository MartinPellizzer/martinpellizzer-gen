    "intro": "Scirpus articulatus var. major, commonly known as the greater bulrush, is a tall, perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its jointed, grass-like stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces dense clusters of small, pale brown flowers at the top of the stem, which are typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in marshy environments. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
