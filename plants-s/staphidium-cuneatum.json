    "intro": "Staphidium cuneatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf staphidium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is a small, herbaceous shrub characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant is native to certain regions of southern Africa, where it typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological role in local habitats. The plant's structure and floral morphology reflect adaptations to its arid or semi-arid environment."
