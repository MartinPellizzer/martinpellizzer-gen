    "intro": "Sabulina texana, commonly known as the Texas sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Texas. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils. The plant features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Sabulina texana is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas."
