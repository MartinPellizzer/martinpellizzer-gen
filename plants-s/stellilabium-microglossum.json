    "intro": "Stellilabium microglossum, commonly known as the star-labium orchid, is a small, delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, star-shaped labellum, which is a specialized petal structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance, and bloom during the spring and early summer months. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
