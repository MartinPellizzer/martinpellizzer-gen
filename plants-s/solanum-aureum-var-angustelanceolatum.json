    "intro": "Solanum aureum var. angustelanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf golden nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It features slender, upright stems with opposite, lanceolate leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by orange to red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in coastal areas and dry forests. Due to its ornamental value and toxic properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires caution."
