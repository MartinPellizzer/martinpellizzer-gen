It is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that contains multiple seeds. Salacia alveolata is often found in moist, shaded environments within dense forest understories."
