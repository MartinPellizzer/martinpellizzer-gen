    "intro": "Salix reticulata f. parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves that are smaller than those of the typical Salix reticulata. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are a key feature in its reproductive cycle. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in temperate climates."
