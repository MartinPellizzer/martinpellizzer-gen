    "intro": "Specklinia sclerophylla, commonly known as the rock fern, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery, and often dark-green fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in mountainous regions. Its leaves are usually clustered at the base, with a compact growth habit that helps it conserve moisture. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
