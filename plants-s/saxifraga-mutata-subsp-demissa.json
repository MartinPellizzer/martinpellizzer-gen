    "intro": "Saxifraga mutata subsp. demissa, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. The plant features small, clustered leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in early summer. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
