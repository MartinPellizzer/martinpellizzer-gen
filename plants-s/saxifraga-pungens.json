    "intro": "Saxifraga pungens, commonly known as the stonecrop saxifrage, is a hardy perennial plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit with fleshy, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine displays. Saxifraga pungens is also known for its ability to tolerate cold temperatures and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and resilience."
