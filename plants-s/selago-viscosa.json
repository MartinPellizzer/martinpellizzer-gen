    "intro": "Selago viscosa, commonly known as sticky selago, is a perennial shrub native to parts of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its glandular leaves that secrete a sticky resin, which gives the plant its common name. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. Its small, white or pinkish flowers appear in clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds. The sticky resin has been used traditionally in some cultures for medicinal purposes."
