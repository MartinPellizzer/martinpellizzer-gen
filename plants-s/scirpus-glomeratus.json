    "intro": "Scirpus glomeratus, commonly known as clustered bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that grow in dense clusters, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers at the top of the stems, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes form extensive underground networks, allowing it to spread rapidly in moist soils. Scirpus glomeratus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
