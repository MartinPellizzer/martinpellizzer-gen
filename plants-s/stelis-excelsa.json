    "intro": "[WRONG START] Steles excelsa, commonly known as the highland orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows at elevations above 1,500 meters, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil. Stelis excelsa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
