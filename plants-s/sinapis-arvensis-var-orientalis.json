It is characterized by its erect, slender stem and alternate leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in racemes, typical of the mustard family, and is often found in disturbed soils and agricultural fields. Its seeds are enclosed in siliques, which are long, slender pods. This species is known for its potential as a cover crop and its use in phytoremediation due to its ability to accumulate heavy metals."
