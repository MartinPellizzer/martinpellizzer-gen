    "intro": "Salix limnogena, commonly known as the water willow, is a shrub native to wetland environments in northern regions. It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous branches and small, elongated leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist to waterlogged soils, making it an important species in riparian and marsh ecosystems. Due to its adaptability to aquatic conditions, it plays a role in stabilizing shoreline vegetation and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
