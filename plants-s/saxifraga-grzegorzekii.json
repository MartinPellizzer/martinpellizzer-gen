    "intro": "Saxifraga grzegorzekii, commonly known as the Polish saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Carpathian Mountains in Central Europe. It typically features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
