    "intro": "Spergularia salina var. urbica, commonly known as the urban sea sandplant, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas and urban soils with high salt content, often found in disturbed or polluted sites. The plant has small, linear leaves and produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It is a low-growing species, often forming dense mats on the ground. Its ability to tolerate extreme conditions makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
