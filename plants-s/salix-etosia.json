    "intro": "Salix etosia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are typically a dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by narrow, elongated fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers, streams, or wetlands. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
