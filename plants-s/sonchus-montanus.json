    "intro": "Sonchus montanus, commonly known as mountain sowthistle, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides. Its hairy leaves and stems help reduce water loss, adapting it to drier environments. The species is also noted for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
