    "intro": "Stenoloma alutaceum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh grass, is a species of flowering plant in the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. This plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. The plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of Africa."
