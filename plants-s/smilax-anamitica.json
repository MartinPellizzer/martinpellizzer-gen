    "intro": "Smilax anamitica, commonly known as the Indian arrowroot or wild arrowroot, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its woody stems and spiny tendrils that aid in climbing. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white, followed by berries that contain several seeds. Its rhizomes are often harvested for their starchy roots, which have been used in traditional medicine and as a food source. Smilax anamitica thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
