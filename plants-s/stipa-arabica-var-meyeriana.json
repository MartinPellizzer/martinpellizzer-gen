    "intro": "Stipa arabica var. meyeriana, commonly known as Meyer's needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant produces tall, slender spikelets that are typically arranged in panicle-like clusters, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
