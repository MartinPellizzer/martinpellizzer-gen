    "intro": "Sempervivum pulvinatum, commonly known as the cushion stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped growth habit, with fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Sempervivum pulvinatum is also known for its ability to survive in harsh climates, including cold temperatures and strong winds."
