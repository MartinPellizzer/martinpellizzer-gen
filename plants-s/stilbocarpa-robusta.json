    "intro": "Stilbocarpa robusta, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length, making it one of the largest ferns in the world. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its rhizomes are submerged and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. Stilbocarpa robusta plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms."
