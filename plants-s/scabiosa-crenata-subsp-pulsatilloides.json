    "intro": "Scabiosa crenata subsp. pulsatilloides, commonly known as the alpine scabious, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and displays clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive, rounded shape. The leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand cold and harsh alpine conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or meadow habitats at high altitudes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in its native environment."
