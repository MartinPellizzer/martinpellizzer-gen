    "intro": "Sisymbrium glanduliferum, commonly known as the glandular broomrape, is an annual plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing some photosynthesis. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are alternate and often have glandular structures, giving it its scientific name. It is typically found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions."
