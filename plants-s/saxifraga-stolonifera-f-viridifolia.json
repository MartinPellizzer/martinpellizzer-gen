    "intro": "Saxifraga stolonifera f. viridifolia, commonly known as the green-leaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features a dense mat of foliage with ovate, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive carpets, making it a hardy and visually appealing ground cover."
