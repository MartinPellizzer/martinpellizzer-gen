    "intro": "Sloanea akaraiensis, commonly known as the Amazonian sloanea, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat fragmentation, it is considered a vulnerable species."
