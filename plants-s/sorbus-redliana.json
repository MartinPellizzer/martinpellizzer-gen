    "intro": "Sorbus redliana, commonly known as the redleaf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds but not for humans. Its leaves are typically oval with serrated edges, and they turn a striking red or orange in the fall. Sorbus redliana is often found in woodland edges and rocky soils, preferring partial shade to full sun."
