    "intro": "Solidago wrightii var. wrightii, commonly known as Wright's goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant typically reaches heights of 1 to 3 meters and has narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies, open woods, and along roadsides. Its showy inflorescences make it an important nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
