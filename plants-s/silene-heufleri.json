    "intro": "Silene heufleri, commonly known as the Heufler's campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial species that typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Silene heufleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
