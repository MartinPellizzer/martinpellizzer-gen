    "intro": "Scirpus lineolatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and tall, cylindrical flower heads that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes form dense stands, helping to stabilize soil and filter water. Scirpus lineolatus plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic and avian species."
