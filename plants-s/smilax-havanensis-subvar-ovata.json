    "intro": "Smilax havanensis subvar. ovata, commonly known as the Cuban arrowroot or smooth smilax, is a climbing vine native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It features woody stems with sharp, recurved spines and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and glossy. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a resilient and sometimes invasive species."
