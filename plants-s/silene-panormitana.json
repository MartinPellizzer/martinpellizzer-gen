    "intro": "Silene panormitana, commonly known as the Panormitana campion, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous species that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in dry and sunny habitats. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Silene panormitana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
