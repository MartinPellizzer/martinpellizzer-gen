    "intro": "Sedum torulosum, commonly known as the yellow stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water and withstand arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its resilience and ornamental appeal make it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant landscapes."
