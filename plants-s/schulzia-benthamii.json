    "intro": "Schulzia benthamii, commonly known as the bentham's schulzia, is a flowering plant native to the highland regions of South America, particularly in Bolivia and Peru. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and trees. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Schulzia benthamii is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
