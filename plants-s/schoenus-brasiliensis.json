    "intro": "Schoenus brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian bulrush, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist to submerged conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization and wetland ecosystem health. The plant's structure and growth patterns make it an important component of aquatic and riparian plant communities."
