    "intro": "Schizoloma prolongatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed lichen, is a rare and specialized plant that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its leaf-like thallus structure, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on decaying wood or stone in temperate regions. Its growth is slow, and it plays a role in nutrient cycling within forest ecosystems. Schizoloma prolongatum is also noted for its chemical composition, which includes various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological interactions."
