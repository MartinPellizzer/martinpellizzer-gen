    "intro": "Saxifraga pentadactylis f. congesta, commonly known as the clustered saxifrage, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, succulent-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to add texture and color to rock gardens."
