    "intro": "Schefflera pawoiensis, commonly known as the Papuan umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the island of New Guinea. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Schefflera pawoiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
