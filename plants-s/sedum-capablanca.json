    "intro": "Sedum capablanca, commonly known as Cape Blanco sedum, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
