    "intro": "Scirpus maritimus var. agonus, commonly known as saltmarsh bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically greenish or reddish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in wetland habitats. It thrives in saline or brackish environments, making it an important component of salt marsh ecosystems."
