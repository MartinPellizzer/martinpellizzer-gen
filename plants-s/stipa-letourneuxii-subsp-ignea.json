    "intro": "Stipa letourneuxii subsp. ignea, commonly known as the red hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive reddish-brown inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and it produces small, spikelet-based flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and visual interest."
