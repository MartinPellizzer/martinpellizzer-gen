    "intro": "Stachys sylvatica var. minus, commonly known as narrow-leaved wood betony, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of violet-blue flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks. This variety is less showy than the typical form of Stachys sylvatica but is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
