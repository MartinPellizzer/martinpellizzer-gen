    "intro": "Sporobolus borszczowii subsp. borszczowii, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert environments. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to arid conditions and a valuable component of native plant communities."
