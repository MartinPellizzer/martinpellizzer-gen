It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into berries, which are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. Solanum kachinense is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and traditional contexts."
