It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and bloom in late summer. Saxifraga alaskana is well adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its natural habitat."
