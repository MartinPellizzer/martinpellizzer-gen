    "intro": "Stelis humidensis, commonly known as the humid mountain orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of rainforests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to other plants without parasitizing them, and they absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Stelis humidensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings."
