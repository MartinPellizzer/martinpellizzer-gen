    "intro": "Selaginella microdonta, commonly known as the lesser clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has slender, branching stems covered with small, scale-like leaves that are often green or reddish in color. It produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Selaginella microdonta is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitats."
