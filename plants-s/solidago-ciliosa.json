    "intro": "Solidago ciliosa, commonly known as the slender goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in meadows and open woodlands. Solidago ciliosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
