It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors. Native to Southeast Asia, these plants typically thrive in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests. The leaves are usually narrow and strap-like, contributing to the plant's distinctive appearance.
