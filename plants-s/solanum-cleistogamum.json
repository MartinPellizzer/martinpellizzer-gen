    "intro": "Solanum cleistogamum, commonly known as the cleistogamous nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its closed, self-pollinating flowers that do not open, a trait known as cleistogamy. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded or moist environments. Its leaves are ovate with a hairy texture, and the fruit is a small, fleshy berry containing several seeds. Due to its unique reproductive strategy, it plays a role in certain ecological systems where pollinators are scarce."
