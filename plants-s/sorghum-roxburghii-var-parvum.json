    "intro": "Sorghum roxburghii var. parvum, commonly known as dwarf finger millet, is a small-grained grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact stature and small, finger-like grains that are rich in nutrients. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, making it well-adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while the inflorescence consists of spikelets that bear the edible grains. This variety is valued for its resilience and nutritional content, making it an important crop in traditional agriculture."
