    "intro": "Sarcopoterium, commonly known as the desert sage or silverleaf sage, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These shrubs are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. They are characterized by their silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Sarcopoterium species typically have small, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of yellow or white. The plant's ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes it an important component of desert ecosystems."
