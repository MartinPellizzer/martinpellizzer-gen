    "intro": "Solidago lancastriensis, commonly known as the Lancashire goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy surface. Solidago lancastriensis plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies during the late growing season."
