    "intro": "Solanum bifolium, commonly known as the two-leaved nightshade, is a perennial herb native to South America. It features a short, stout stem with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into round, fleshy berries. Its leaves and berries contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks."
