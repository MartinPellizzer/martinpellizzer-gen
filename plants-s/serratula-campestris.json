    "intro": "Serratula campestris, commonly known as field sowthistle, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. Serratula campestris is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in fields, where it thrives in full sun."
