    "intro": "Strobilanthes kannanii, commonly known as the Kanyakumari flame flower, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to the southern regions of India. It is characterized by its vibrant orange-red bracts that resemble flames, which are not true flowers but specialized leaf-like structures. The plant is a member of the Acanthaceae family and typically grows in coastal and sandy soils. It blooms during the monsoon season, adding a dramatic visual impact to its natural habitat. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
