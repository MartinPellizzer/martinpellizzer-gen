    "intro": "Sorghastrum rigidifolium, commonly known as rigidleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its stiff, upright growth habit and narrow, rigid leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like flower clusters that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological value as a forage species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairie and woodland habitats. Sorghastrum rigidifolium is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in native plant restoration projects."
