    "intro": "Scirpus rollandii, commonly known as the rolled sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered spikelets that produce wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in moist to water-saturated soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Scirpus rollandii plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to the structure of wetland ecosystems."
