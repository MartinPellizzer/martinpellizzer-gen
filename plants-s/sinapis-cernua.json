    "intro": "Sinapis cernua, commonly known as common honesty, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces slender, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are often used as a source of oil. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately divided, and have a mild, peppery aroma. Sinapis cernua is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
