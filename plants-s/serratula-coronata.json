    "intro": "Serratula coronata, commonly known as the golden crown, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and foliage with serrated edges. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its leaves are narrow and alternate, often covered in fine hairs, and it has a taproot system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Serratula coronata is also known for its medicinal properties, historically used by Native American tribes for various health purposes."
