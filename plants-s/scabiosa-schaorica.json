    "intro": "Scabiosa schaorica, commonly known as the mountain scabious, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to white. The plant produces fluffy, white seed heads that are often mistaken for cotton, which aid in wind pollination. Scabiosa schaorica thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its delicate appearance and ability to attract beneficial insects make it a valuable addition to ecological gardens."
