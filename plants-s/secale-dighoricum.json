    "intro": "Secale dighoricum, commonly known as the Dighori rye, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapting to the harsh, high-altitude environments where it thrives. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, Secale dighoricum is considered a rare and specialized species."
