    "intro": "Scleranthus annuus f. pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf common thornweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is a small annual herb characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in disturbed soils and grasslands. Due to its small size and specific habitat preferences, it is less commonly cultivated but can be found in botanical gardens and naturalized areas."
