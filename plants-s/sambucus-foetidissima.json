    "intro": "Sambucus foetidissima, commonly known as the stink bush or stinkweed, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into 5 to 9 leaflets, and its clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its strong, unpleasant odor, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
