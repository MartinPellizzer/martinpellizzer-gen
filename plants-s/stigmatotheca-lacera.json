    "intro": "Stigmatotheca lacera, commonly known as the fringed stigmatotheca, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its scientific name reflects the frayed or split appearance of its seed-bearing structures, which are distinctive in morphology. Stigmatotheca lacera is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, where it adapts to poor soil conditions and limited water availability."
