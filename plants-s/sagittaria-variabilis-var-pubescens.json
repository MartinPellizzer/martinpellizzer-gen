It typically grows in shallow wetlands, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant features arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it its common name. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in a spike, emerging above the water surface. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
