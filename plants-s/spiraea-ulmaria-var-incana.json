    "intro": "Spiraea ulmaria var. incana, commonly known as white meadow spirea, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically gray-green and have a slightly hairy texture, which gives the plant its varietal name \"incana.\" It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
