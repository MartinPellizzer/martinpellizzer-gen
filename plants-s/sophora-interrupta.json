    "intro": "Sophora interrupta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed senna, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with narrow, elongated leaflets. The plant produces yellow to golden yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in racemes. Sophora interrupta is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along canyons. It is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects."
