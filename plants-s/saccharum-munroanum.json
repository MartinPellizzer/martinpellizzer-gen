    "intro": "Saccharum munroanum, commonly known as wild sugarcane, is a tall grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its robust, fibrous stalks that contain high levels of sucrose. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a prominent midrib, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Due to its high sugar content, it is sometimes cultivated for biofuel and industrial purposes."
