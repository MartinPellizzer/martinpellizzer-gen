    "intro": "Salvia heterophylla, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, sky-blue to lavender-colored flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a soft, velvety texture. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
