    "intro": "Sarcocapnos crassifolia var. micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sarcocapnos, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers during the cooler months, which are followed by small, spherical fruits. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. This variety is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand prolonged periods of drought."
