    "intro": "Salvia peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its square stems and aromatic foliage. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Salvia peninsularis thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to Mediterranean gardens."
