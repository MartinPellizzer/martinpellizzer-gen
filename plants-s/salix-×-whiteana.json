    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 whiteana, commonly known as the white willow, is a hybrid shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of the United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive white to pale green foliage. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a smooth margin, with a silvery underside that gives the plant its name. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetland areas."
