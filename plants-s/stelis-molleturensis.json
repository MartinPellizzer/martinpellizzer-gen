    "intro": "Stelis molleturensis, commonly known as the Molleturo Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean region of South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are usually small, clustered in inflorescences, and display a range of colors including white, pink, and purple. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
