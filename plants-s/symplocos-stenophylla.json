    "intro": "Symplocos stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its elliptical, glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories. Symplocos stenophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
