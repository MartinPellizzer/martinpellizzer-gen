    "intro": "Salix lugdunensis, commonly known as the European white willow, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and long, narrow leaves that are typically whitish underneath. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist soils along rivers and streams, making it a common sight in riparian habitats. The bark of Salix lugdunensis has been historically used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties."
