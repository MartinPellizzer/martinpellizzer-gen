    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 costei, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually reddish-brown on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. Salix \u00d7 costei is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
