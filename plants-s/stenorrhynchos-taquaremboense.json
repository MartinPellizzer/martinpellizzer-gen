    "intro": "Stenorrhynchos taquaremboense, commonly known as the Taquarembo orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the coastal regions of Uruguay. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its compact growth habit and strikingly colored flowers. The plant typically features a single, erect stem with a few broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
