    "intro": "Staelia caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clumps of grass-like leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its flowering period typically occurs in late summer, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators in its native environments. Staelia caespitosa is well adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
