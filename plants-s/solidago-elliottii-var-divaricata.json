It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer to early autumn, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a rough texture. This variety is distinguished by its branching pattern and is valued for its ecological role in supporting native wildlife."
