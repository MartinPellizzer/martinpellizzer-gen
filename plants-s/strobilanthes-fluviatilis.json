It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble orchids, with bright yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, swampy areas and is adapted to seasonal flooding, which influences its life cycle. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, aiding in photosynthesis in aquatic environments.
