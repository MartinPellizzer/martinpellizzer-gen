    "intro": "Salix yoshinoi, commonly known as the Yoshino willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and clusters of small, catkin-like flowers that appear in early spring. The leaves are oval, serrated, and turn a striking yellow in the fall. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value, particularly for its delicate spring foliage and soft, cascading form. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight."
