It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers in early spring. The plant is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its bulbs are used in traditional medicine and horticulture for their ornamental value. Scilla filiformis is well adapted to temperate climates and is relatively easy to cultivate in gardens."
