It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, while its flowers are small and clustered in a head-like structure. Senecio sciadophilus is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to add greenery in low-light conditions."
