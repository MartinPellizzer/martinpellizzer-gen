    "intro": "Sorghum eplicatum var. fiorii, commonly known as the pink-flowered sorghum, is a striking variant of the sorghum genus native to Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant pink to purple inflorescences, which distinguish it from typical green sorghum varieties. The plant is a tall grass with narrow, blade-like leaves and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Despite its ornamental value, it shares the drought tolerance and adaptability typical of other sorghum species."
