    "intro": "Sagina glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or along riverbanks. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture. Sagina glandulifera is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in difficult environments."
