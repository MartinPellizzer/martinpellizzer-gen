    "intro": "Sideroxylon brownii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant has compound leaves with opposite arrangement and produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsule fruits. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its slow growth and high commercial value, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
