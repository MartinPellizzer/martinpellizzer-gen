    "intro": "Salix chamissonis subsp. integerrima, commonly known as the Pacific willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, often swampy environments. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive biology. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a smooth or slightly toothed margin. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing stream banks and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
