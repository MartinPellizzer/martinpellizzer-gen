    "intro": "Stipa dura, commonly known as hardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and\u575a\u97e7\u7684 (resilient) culms that can withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. Stipa dura is well adapted to drought and poor soil conditions, making it a common component of steppe and desert ecosystems. Its fibrous structure and hardiness make it valuable for erosion control and as a forage plant in certain regions."
