    "intro": "Saccularia, commonly known as the bladderworts, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, bladder-like structures called sacs, which are used to trap microscopic organisms for nourishment. Saccularia species are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. They have thin, ribbon-like leaves and often produce small, inconspicuous flowers. The genus includes around 30 species, many of which are adapted to nutrient-poor aquatic habitats."
