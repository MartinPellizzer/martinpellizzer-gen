    "intro": "Sagenia gigantea var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf sagena, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the temperate regions of the northeastern United States. It features upright, slender stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver along the edges. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink during the late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its low-growing habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
