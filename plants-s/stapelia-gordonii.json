    "intro": "Stapelia gordonii, commonly known as the carrion flower, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and distinctive, waxy leaves that resemble dead leaves. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor. These flowers are designed to attract pollinators such as flies and beetles, mimicking the appearance and scent of decaying flesh. Stapelia gordonii is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
