    "intro": "Solanum stelligerum var. magnifolium, commonly known as the magnificent nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often blooming at night. Its fruits are berries that turn from green to red as they mature, containing toxic compounds similar to other members of the Solanaceae family. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is often cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
