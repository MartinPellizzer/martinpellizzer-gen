    "intro": "Stylidium coroniforme, commonly known as the crownless sun-orchid, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant has a short, erect stem with a few leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, particularly bees, due to their nectar-rich structure. Stylidium coroniforme is often found in sandy or rocky soils in open habitats."
