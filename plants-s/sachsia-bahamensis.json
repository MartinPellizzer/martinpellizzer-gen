    "intro": "Sachsia bahamensis, commonly known as the Bahamian sachsia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands, particularly the Bahamas. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or purple tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, often in moist environments. Its foliage is usually lance-shaped with a glossy appearance, and it produces small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
