    "intro": "Sedum rosea var. aleuticum, commonly known as the Aleutian stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and withstand harsh maritime conditions. The plant produces clusters of pink to red flowers in late summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it adaptable to rocky and coastal environments. Its resilience and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
