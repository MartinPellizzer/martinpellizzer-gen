    "intro": "Saussurea tenella, commonly known as narrowleafed thistle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, gray-green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its stems are often branched and covered with dense, stiff hairs. Saussurea tenella is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
