    "intro": "Silene novissima, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada silene, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Silene novissima is an important part of the alpine ecosystem and is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and climate change."
