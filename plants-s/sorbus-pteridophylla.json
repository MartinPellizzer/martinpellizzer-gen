    "intro": "Sorbus pteridophylla, commonly known as the fern-leaf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into feather-like segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, red or orange berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
