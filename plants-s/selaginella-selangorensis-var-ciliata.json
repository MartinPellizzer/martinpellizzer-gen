    "intro": "Selaginella selangorensis var. ciliata, commonly known as the ciliate spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, creeping plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant features whorled leaves that are often covered with fine, ciliate (bristly) hairs, giving it its scientific name. It produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of its stems. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in humid, indoor settings."
