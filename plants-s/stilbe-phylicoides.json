    "intro": "Stilbe phylicoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandmat, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal dunes. The plant has slender, branching stems that are covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow, linear, and often slightly hairy. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences, and it blooms during the summer months. Stilbe phylicoides is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils through its extensive root system."
