    "intro": "Staelia filifolia, commonly known as the threadleaf staelia, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and narrow, thread-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cold, harsh environments. Its structure is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures, with a low-growing habit that minimizes exposure to extreme weather. Staelia filifolia is often found in tundra and alpine habitats, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem."
