    "intro": "Stelis florianii, commonly known as the Florigera orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple, during the warmer months. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it capture rainwater efficiently. Stelis florianii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
