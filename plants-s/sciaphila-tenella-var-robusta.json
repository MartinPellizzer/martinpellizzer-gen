    "intro": "Sciaphila tenella var. robusta, commonly known as the robust ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches in tropical forests. The plant features slender, fleshy roots and produces small, delicate white or greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and clustered at the base of the plant. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a vulnerable species."
