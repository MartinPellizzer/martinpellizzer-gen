    "intro": "Statice behen, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescences of tiny, showy flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often growing in dunes and salt marshes. Its flowers, which range in color from pink to violet, bloom in late summer and early autumn. Statice behen is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes and is also used in dried flower arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms."
