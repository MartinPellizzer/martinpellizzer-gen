    "intro": "Stoebe spiralis, commonly known as spiral caraway, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy and bear small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense, spiral patterns. The plant produces tiny, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its wide distribution. Its leaves are basal, alternate, and have a distinctive, aromatic scent when crushed. Stoebe spiralis thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in meadows and rocky habitats."
