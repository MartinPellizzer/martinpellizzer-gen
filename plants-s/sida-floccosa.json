    "intro": "Sida floccosa, commonly known as wooly sida, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its soft, fluffy appearance due to the dense, white pubescence covering its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in groups of three. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Sida floccosa is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes other plants such as hibiscus and cotton."
