    "intro": "Strobilanthes peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular rainforest morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within primary forests, often as an epiphyte on tree trunks or branches. Its unique floral structure and ecological niche make it an important component of the region's biodiversity. However, due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
