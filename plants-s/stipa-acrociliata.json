    "intro": "Stipa acrociliata, commonly known as the tufted needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, tufted clusters of fine, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Stipa acrociliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its delicate, upright growth habit."
