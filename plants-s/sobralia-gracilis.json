The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Sobralia gracilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
