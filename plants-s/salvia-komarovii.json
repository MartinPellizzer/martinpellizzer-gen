    "intro": "Salvia komarovii, commonly known as Komarov's sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking violet to blue-purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
