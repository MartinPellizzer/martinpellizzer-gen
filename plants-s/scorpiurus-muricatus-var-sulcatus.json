    "intro": "Scorpiurus muricatus var. sulcatus, commonly known as the serrated mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, kidney-shaped leaves with serrated edges, which give it its common name. The plant produces tiny white flowers that bloom in the spring, typically from March to May. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its mild diuretic properties."
