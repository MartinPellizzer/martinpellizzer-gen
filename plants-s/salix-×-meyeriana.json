    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 meyeriana, commonly known as the Weeping Willow, is a hybrid species of willow native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive weeping habit, with long, drooping branches that drape gracefully over water. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green in summer and turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in moist environments, such as riverbanks and wetlands, and is often planted for its ornamental value. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate waterlogged soil make it a popular choice for landscaping and erosion control."
