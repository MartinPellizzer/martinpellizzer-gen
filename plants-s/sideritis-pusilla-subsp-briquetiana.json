    "intro": "Sideritis pusilla subsp. briquetiana, commonly known as the Balkan germander, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its small, tubular flowers are usually purple or blue, and it produces small, oblong seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
