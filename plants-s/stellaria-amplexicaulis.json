    "intro": "Stellaria amplexicaulis, commonly known as the clasping starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white or pale pink star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that often wrap around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats."
