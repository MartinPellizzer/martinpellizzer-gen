    "intro": "Salix aurita f. cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves, which are typically broad and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and its bark is often covered in a white or grayish flaky layer. It thrives in moist environments such as riverbanks and wetlands, making it an important species in riparian ecosystems. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic habitats."
