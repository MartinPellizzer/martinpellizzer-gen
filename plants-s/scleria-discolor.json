    "intro": "Scleria discolor, commonly known as the white-eyed bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often subtended by leaf-like bracts. Scleria discolor is typically found in wetland habitats such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in its native environment."
