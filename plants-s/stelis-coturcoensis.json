    "intro": "Stelis coturcoensis, commonly known as the Coturco orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a sympodial growth pattern, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a variety of colors including white, yellow, and green. Stelis coturcoensis is often found in humid, shaded environments such as cloud forests."
