    "intro": "Stachys palustris var. puberula, commonly known as swamp betony, is a perennial herb native to wetland environments in North America. It features upright, hairy stems that often bear opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces spikes of violet to purple flowers in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist to wet soils, making it a valuable addition to wetland restoration projects. Its varietal form, puberula, is distinguished by its dense pubescence, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance."
