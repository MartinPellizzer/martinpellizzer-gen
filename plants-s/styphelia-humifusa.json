    "intro": "Styphelia humifusa, commonly known as the lowland heath, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It typically grows in heathlands and sandy soils, characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, which bloom in spring. Styphelia humifusa is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and drought. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
