    "intro": "Stenodraba andina var. stylosa, commonly known as the Andean narrowleaf saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its mountainous habitat. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine environments and is often found in open, sunny areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
