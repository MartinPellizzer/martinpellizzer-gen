    "intro": "Sorghum lithophilum, commonly known as the rock sorghum, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its robust, fibrous stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand extreme heat and drought. The plant typically grows on rocky soils, showcasing its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Its flowering spikes produce small, clustered panicles, which are often pale green to reddish in color. Sorghum lithophilum is valued for its resilience and has been used traditionally for forage and erosion control in its native habitats."
