    "intro": "Scorzonera laciniata f. decumbens, commonly known as the creeping scorzonera, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a low-growing habit with decumbent stems that lie close to the ground, often rooting at the nodes. The plant produces basal leaves that are lobed and sometimes hairy, and it bears yellow flowers with five petals. Its root system is notable for being tuberous and edible, similar to other members of the genus Scorzonera. This variety is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and slopes."
