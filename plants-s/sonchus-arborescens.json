    "intro": "Sonchus arborescens, commonly known as tree sowthistle, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain regions."
