    "intro": "Spiraea laciniata, commonly known as the cut-leaved spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely dissected, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early to mid-spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or streamside habitats. Spiraea laciniata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
