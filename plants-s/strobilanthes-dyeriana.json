    "intro": "Strobilanthes dyeriana, commonly known as the \"Ceylon flame flower,\" is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant orange-red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its flowering period occurs during the rainy season, and the bracts remain for several months, making it a visually dramatic species. Strobilanthes dyeriana is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and botanical collections."
