    "intro": "Salix rotundifolia var. rotundifolia, commonly known as round-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to northern regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its smooth, slender stems and heart-shaped, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as streams and wetlands. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
