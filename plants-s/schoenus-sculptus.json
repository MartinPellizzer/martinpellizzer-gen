    "intro": "Schoenus sculptus, commonly known as the sculpted sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, ridged, and often sculptural inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along waterways, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and the flowers are small and clustered in spikelets. Schoenus sculptus is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments."
