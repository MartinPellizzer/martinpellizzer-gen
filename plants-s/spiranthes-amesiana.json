    "intro": "Spiranthes amesiana, commonly known as the Ames' ladies' tresses, is a species of orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiral arrangement of flowers along a slender stem, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its flowers are usually pink to white in color and bloom in late spring to early summer. It is a perennial herb that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological significance in forest ecosystems."
