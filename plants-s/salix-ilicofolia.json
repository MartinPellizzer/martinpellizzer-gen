    "intro": "Salix ilicofolia, commonly known as the silky willow, is a species of willow native to the western United States. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, sunny environments such as streambanks and wet meadows. The plant is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. Its flowers are catkins, which are typically found in clusters, and it produces small, round fruits called samaras. Salix ilicofolia plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
