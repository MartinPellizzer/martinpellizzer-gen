It is characterized by its vibrant yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant produces small, bristly seeds enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, also known as the sunflower family, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
