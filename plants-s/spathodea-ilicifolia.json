    "intro": "Spathodea ilicifolia, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, bright orange-red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture with a waxy coating. Spathodea ilicifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates."
