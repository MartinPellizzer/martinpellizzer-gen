    "intro": "Spergularia marginata subsp. intermedia, commonly known as the coastal sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy coastal areas. It has small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from S. marginata, particularly in leaf shape and growth habit."
