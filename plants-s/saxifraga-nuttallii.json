    "intro": "Saxifraga nuttallii, commonly known as Nuttall's saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Saxifraga nuttallii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
