    "intro": "Scirpus maritimus var. fluviatilis, commonly known as the river bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or along the edges of rivers and lakes. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or brown, and it has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It thrives in brackish or freshwater habitats and is often found in marshes, swamps, and tidal flats. Scirpus maritimus var. fluviatilis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
