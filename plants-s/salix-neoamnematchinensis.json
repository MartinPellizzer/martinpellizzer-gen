    "intro": "Salix neoamnematchinensis, commonly known as the Amnematchin willow, is a species of willow native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and its flowers are usually inconspicuous. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its region."
