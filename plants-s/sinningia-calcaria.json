    "intro": "Sinningia calcaria, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant features a rosette of fleshy, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. Sinningia calcaria blooms during the summer months, producing clusters of tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
