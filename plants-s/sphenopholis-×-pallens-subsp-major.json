    "intro": "Sphenopholis \u00d7 pallens subsp. major, commonly known as the giant sphenophyllum, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant belonging to the family Sphenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, feather-like leaves that resemble those of modern ferns. This subspecies is native to the mountainous regions of South America, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its unique morphology suggests a close evolutionary relationship with early land plants. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
