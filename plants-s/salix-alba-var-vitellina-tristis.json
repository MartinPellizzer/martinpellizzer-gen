    "intro": "Salix alba var. vitellina-tristis, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a variant of the white willow characterized by its cascading branches that droop gracefully. It is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found near water sources such as rivers and lakes. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by wind. The weeping willow is valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to stabilize riverbanks through its extensive root system."
