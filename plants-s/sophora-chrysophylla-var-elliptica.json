    "intro": "Sophora chrysophylla var. elliptica, commonly known as the golden-leaf senna, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow leaves, which are elliptical in shape and often clustered at the ends of branches. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and parks for its vibrant foliage."
