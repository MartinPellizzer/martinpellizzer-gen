It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats at moderate elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
