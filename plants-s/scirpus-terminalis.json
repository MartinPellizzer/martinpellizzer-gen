    "intro": "Scirpus terminalis, commonly known as the common bulrush, is a tall, perennial wetland plant native to North America. It has tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-brown flowers at the top of the stems, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize wetland soils and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Scirpus terminalis is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes."
