    "intro": "Spergularia purpurea proles indurata, commonly known as the hard-stemmed sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and sandy environments. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and fleshy, succulent stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically narrow and linear. It is adapted to harsh conditions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. This species is often found in coastal dunes and dry grasslands, playing a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
