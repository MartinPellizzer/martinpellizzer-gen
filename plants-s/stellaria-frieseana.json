    "intro": "Stellaria frieseana, commonly known as the Friesian starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are opposite, linear to lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs. Stellaria frieseana thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
