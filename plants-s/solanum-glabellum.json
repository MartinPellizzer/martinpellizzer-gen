    "intro": "Solanum glabellum, commonly known as the smooth nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and dark green, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into round, red berries, which are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Solanum glabellum typically grows in coastal areas and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
