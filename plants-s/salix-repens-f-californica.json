    "intro": "Salix repens f. californica, commonly known as the California willow, is a shrub-like plant native to the western United States. It is a variant of the common willow, characterized by its slender, spreading growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in riparian zones. Its catkins are a notable feature, with male and female flowers appearing on separate plants. It has adapted to the temperate climate of California, showing resilience to seasonal variations in water availability."
