    "intro": "[WRONG START] Senecio vulgarus var. villosus, commonly known as the downy groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant features slender stems covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions."
