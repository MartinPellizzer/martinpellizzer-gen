    "intro": "Swertia lahulensis, commonly known as the Lahul Himalayan gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving at elevations between 2,500 and 4,500 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in cold, arid conditions. Swertia lahulensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
