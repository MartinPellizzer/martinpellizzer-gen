    "intro": "Spiranthes autumnalis, commonly known as the autumn spider orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, spiral-shaped flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. The flowers are pollinated by various insects, including bees and flies, contributing to its ecological significance."
