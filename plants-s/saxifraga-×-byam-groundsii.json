    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 byam-groundsii, commonly known as the Byam-Grounds saxifrage, is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, with dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in a compact inflorescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
