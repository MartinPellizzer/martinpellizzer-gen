    "intro": "Stipa pennata subsp. pennata, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, pale green to yellowish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
