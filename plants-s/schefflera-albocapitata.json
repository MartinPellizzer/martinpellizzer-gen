    "intro": "Schefflera albocapitata, commonly known as the white-headed schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like clusters of leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by white, fleshy fruits that are attractive to birds. Its adaptability to various soil types and moderate watering makes it a popular ornamental plant. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
