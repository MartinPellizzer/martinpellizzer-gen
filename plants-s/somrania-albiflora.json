    "intro": "Somrania albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered somrania, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. The plant has a low-growing, succulent habit with fleshy, narrow leaves that help it conserve water. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited rainfall. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often found in rocky outcrops and along dry riverbeds."
