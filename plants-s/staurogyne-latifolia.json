It has slender, branching stems that are often covered in small, opposite leaves. The leaves are broad and oval-shaped, with a smooth margin and a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in clusters near the water surface. This plant plays an important role in providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
