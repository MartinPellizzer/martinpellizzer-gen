    "intro": "Sphenomeris chusana var. kenzoana, commonly known as the Kenzoana sphenomeris, is a rare and delicate fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which contribute to its unique texture and appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
