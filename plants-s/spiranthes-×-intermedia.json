    "intro": "Spiranthes \u00d7 intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate ladies' tresses, is a perennial orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive spiral arrangement of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as bogs and wet meadows. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Due to its unique floral structure and ecological role, it is often found in conservation efforts aimed at preserving wetland ecosystems."
