It features basal rosettes of ovate, dark green leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. Its foliage and flowering habits make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
