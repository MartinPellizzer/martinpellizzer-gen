    "intro": "Sideroxylon sandwicense, commonly known as the Hawaiian ironwood, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is a slow-growing, evergreen tree that can reach heights of up to 15 meters. The plant is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and hard, heavy wood that is highly valued for its durability. Native to the Hawaiian Islands, it thrives in coastal and lowland habitats. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
