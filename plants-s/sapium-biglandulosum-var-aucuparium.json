    "intro": "Sapium biglandulosum var. aucuparium, commonly known as the black walnut, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its dark, ridged bark and large, compound leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces green, spherical fruits that mature into hard-shelled nuts, which contain a rich, oily kernel. The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with bacteria in its root system. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas."
