    "intro": "Sonchus lachnocephalus, commonly known as the purple milk thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a flat-topped inflorescence, followed by spiny, spherical seed heads. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a weed in many regions and can outcompete native vegetation."
