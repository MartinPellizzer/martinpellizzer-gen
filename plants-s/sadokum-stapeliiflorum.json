    "intro": "Sadokum stapeliiflorum, commonly known as the Cape tulip, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is known for its ability to store water in its leaves and stems, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. It produces its flowers in late summer or early autumn, and the blooms are often followed by the development of small, round fruits. Sadokum stapeliiflorum is popular among succulent enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
