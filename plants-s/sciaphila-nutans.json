    "intro": "Sciaphila nutans, commonly known as the nodding ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's flowers are small, greenish-white, and emit a faint fragrance, typically blooming at night. Sciaphila nutans thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires specific conditions to survive. Due to habitat loss and its rare occurrence, it is considered endangered in many regions."
