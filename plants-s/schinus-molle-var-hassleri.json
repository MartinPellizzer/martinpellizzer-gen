    "intro": "Schinus molle var. hassleri, commonly known as the velvet tree or velvet tamarack, is a variant of the common velvet tree native to South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and compound leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to different environments. The plant's ornamental value and ecological significance contribute to its presence in both natural and cultivated landscapes."
