    "intro": "Symplocos bahiensis, commonly known as Brazilian wax tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its dense, wax-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is known for its ornamental value due to its compact form and attractive foliage. Symplocos bahiensis is also noted for its fragrant flowers, which bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
