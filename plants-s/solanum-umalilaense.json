    "intro": "Solanum umalilaense, commonly known as the Umalila nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom at night. The plant produces berries that are toxic to humans but may serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within the Solanum genus."
