    "intro": "Scheelea regia, commonly known as the royal scheelea, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and elongated, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets, a common feature among grasses. Scheelea regia is often found in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
