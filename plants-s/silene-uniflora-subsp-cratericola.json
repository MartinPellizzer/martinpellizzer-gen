    "intro": "Silene uniflora subsp. cratericola, commonly known as the crater rockpink, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its subspecies status reflects its distinct ecological adaptation to the harsh conditions of mountainous terrain. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
