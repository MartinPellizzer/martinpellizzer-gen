    "intro": "Stichorkis janowskii, commonly known as the Janowsky's stichorkis, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Gesneriaceae. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills of Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited research on its ecological role and conservation status."
