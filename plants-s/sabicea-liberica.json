    "intro": "Sabicea liberica, commonly known as the Liberian sabicea, is a tropical shrub native to West Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
