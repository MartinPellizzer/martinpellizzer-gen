It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, sparsely hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, berry-like fruits that are typically green when mature. Solanum arcuatum belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other toxic plants such as tomatoes and potatoes. It is often found in rocky or disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain areas."
