    "intro": "Spiranthes pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's spiral orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spiral-shaped inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, with a subtle fragrance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species in many areas."
