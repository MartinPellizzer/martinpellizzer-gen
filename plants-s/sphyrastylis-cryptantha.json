    "intro": "Sphyrastylis cryptantha, commonly known as the hidden-styled sphyrastylis, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit with dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces tiny, fragrant blossoms that are often overlooked due to their size. Sphyrastylis cryptantha is notable for its unique floral structure, which features a deeply recessed corolla and a distinctive, elongated staminode. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
