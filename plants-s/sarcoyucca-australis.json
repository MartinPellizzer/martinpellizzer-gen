It is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tall, sword-shaped leaves that are often lined with sharp spines. The plant produces large, showy white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters at the top of the plant. It is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and resilience make it a popular choice for gardens in dry climates."
