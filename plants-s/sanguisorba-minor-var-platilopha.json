    "intro": "Sanguisorba minor var. platilopha, commonly known as narrow-leaved bloodwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It features upright stems that bear clusters of small, reddish-brown to purple flowers. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows or along stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its striking flower color and its ability to attract pollinators."
