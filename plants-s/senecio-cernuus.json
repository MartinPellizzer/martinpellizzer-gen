It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that features dense clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a velvety texture, and its stems often trail or hang downward, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
