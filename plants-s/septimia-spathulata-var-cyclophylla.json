    "intro": "Septimia spathulata var. cyclophylla, commonly known as the cyclophyllan spathulate, is a rare and unique variant of the spathulate septimia. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring broad, ovate leaves with a wavy margin. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
