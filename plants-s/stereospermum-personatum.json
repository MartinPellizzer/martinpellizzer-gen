    "intro": "Stereospermum personatum, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces showy, orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich reddish color, though it is also used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland forests."
