    "intro": "Solanum ramulosum, commonly known as the African nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and hairy stems, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered in the axils of the leaves. Its berries, which ripen to a deep blue or black color, are edible but contain toxic compounds. Solanum ramulosum is often found in disturbed soils and is adaptable to various environmental conditions."
