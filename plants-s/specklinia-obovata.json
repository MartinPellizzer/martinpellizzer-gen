    "intro": "Specklinia obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate pigmy orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features compact, fleshy leaves that are obovate in shape, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a raceme, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates. Due to its small size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for miniature orchid collections."
