    "intro": "[WRONG START] Statice maritima var. Langeana, commonly known as the Langeana sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and its ability to thrive in salty, well-drained soils. The plant produces dense clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom from late summer to early autumn. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value. This variety is a variant of the common statice, distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and floral characteristics."
