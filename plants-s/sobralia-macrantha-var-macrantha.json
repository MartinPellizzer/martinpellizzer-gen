It is characterized by its robust, pseudobulbous stems and large, showy orchid flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant produces pendulous, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are usually long and strap-like, adapted for efficient photosynthesis in its natural habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
