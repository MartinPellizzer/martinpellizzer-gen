    "intro": "Soehrensia camarguensis, commonly known as the Camargue sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of the Camargue region in southern France. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, exhibiting a robust rhizomatous root system that helps it thrive in wetland environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food and shelter for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms. Soehrensia camarguensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
