    "intro": "Santalina madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, heartwood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments and has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, woody fruits that contain several seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
