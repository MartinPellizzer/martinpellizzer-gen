It is characterized by its slender, arching branches that bear clusters of small, white flowers in early summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Spiraea majestica is often used in landscaping for its graceful appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
