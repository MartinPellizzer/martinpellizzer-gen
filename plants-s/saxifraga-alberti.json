    "intro": "Saxifraga alberti, commonly known as Albert's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with a waxy coating, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer, often clustered at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Saxifraga alberti is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging garden conditions."
