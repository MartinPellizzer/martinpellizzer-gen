    "intro": "Silene acaulis var. dianthiflora, commonly known as the cushion pink, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a rosette structure of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to cold climates and high-altitude conditions."
