    "intro": "Stelis kentii, commonly known as the Kent's orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, epiphytic plant that grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with intricate patterns. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, and it thrives in warm, humid environments. Stelis kentii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and unique floral structure."
