    "intro": "Schismus arabicus var. minutus, commonly known as the small-scale grass or dwarf schismus, is a small, annual grass species native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers in spikelets, which are arranged in loose clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry environments. Due to its small size and drought tolerance, it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides in its native range."
