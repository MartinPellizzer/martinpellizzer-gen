    "intro": "Solena obovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed solena, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features lance-shaped, slightly hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots are adapted to thrive in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rocky or arid environments. Solena obovata is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
