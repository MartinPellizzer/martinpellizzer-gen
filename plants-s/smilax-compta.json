    "intro": "Smilax compta, commonly known as the slender catbriar, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and parts of Georgia. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with stout, spiny stems that help it ascend through vegetation. Its leaves are typically arrow-shaped with a pointed tip and are often covered in small, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species."
