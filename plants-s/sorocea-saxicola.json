    "intro": "Sorocea saxicola, commonly known as the rock sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the base of the plant. Sorocea saxicola thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it a hardy species well-suited for xerophytic conditions."
