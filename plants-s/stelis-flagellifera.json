    "intro": "Stelis flagellifera, commonly known as the whip-stem stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees in humid, tropical environments, using its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals. Its stems are slender and often have a whip-like appearance, giving it its common name. Stelis flagellifera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
