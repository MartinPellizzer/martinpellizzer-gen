    "intro": "Silene lagrangei, commonly known as the Lagrange's campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Silene lagrangei has slender stems and lance-shaped leaves, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
