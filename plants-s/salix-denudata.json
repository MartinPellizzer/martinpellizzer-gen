    "intro": "Salix denudata, commonly known as the naked willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairless. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or alpine environments. Salix denudata is notable for its ecological importance, providing habitat and food for various arctic and subarctic wildlife species."
