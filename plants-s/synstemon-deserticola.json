    "intro": "Synstemon deserticola, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant has hairy, ribbed stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves adapted to conserve water in harsh desert conditions. It typically blooms in summer, producing clusters of five-petaled flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Synstemon deserticola is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
