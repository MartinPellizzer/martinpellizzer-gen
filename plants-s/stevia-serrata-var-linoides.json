    "intro": "[WRONG START] S-tevia serrata var. linoides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, pale green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is renowned for its intense sweetness, derived from compounds called steviol glycosides, which are naturally occurring and non-caloric. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Due to its low maintenance and high sugar content, it is widely used as a natural sweetener in food and beverages."
