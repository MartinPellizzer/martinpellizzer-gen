    "intro": "Saxifraga geranioides f. multidentata, commonly known as the multi-toothed saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, pinkish-purple flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine gardens."
