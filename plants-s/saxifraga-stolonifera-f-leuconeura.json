    "intro": "Saxifraga stolonifera f. leuconeura, commonly known as the white-stemmed saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features a rosette of fleshy, waxy leaves that are typically green with a bluish or silver hue. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a hardy and resilient species."
