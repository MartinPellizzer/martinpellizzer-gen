    "intro": "Solidago flabellata, commonly known as the flatleaf goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its feathery, flat-topped inflorescences that bear small, bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a distinctive flat or folded appearance. Solidago flabellata plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies during the late summer and early fall."
