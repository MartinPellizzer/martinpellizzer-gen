    "intro": "Saponaria ocymoides subsp. ocymoides, commonly known as the pink soapwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of small, pink to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the upper leaves are smaller and more narrow. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. The species is noted for its mild soap-like scent, which is derived from the saponins present in its foliage."
