    "intro": "Salix cordata var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with reddish or purple hues in the autumn. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects. It is also sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its graceful appearance."
