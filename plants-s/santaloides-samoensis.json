    "intro": "Santaloides samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan sandalwood, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and fragrant wood. The plant forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species."
