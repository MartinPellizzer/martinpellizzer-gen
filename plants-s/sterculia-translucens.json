    "intro": "Sterculia translucens, commonly known as the translucent sterculia, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, waxy leaves that display a unique translucency, especially when exposed to direct sunlight. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sterculia translucens is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
