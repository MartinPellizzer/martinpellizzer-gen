It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig-like fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
