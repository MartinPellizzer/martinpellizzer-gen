    "intro": "Sagittaria lancifolia subsp. lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arrowhead, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to the eastern United States. It features narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a distinctive leaf sheath that encloses the stem. The plant produces small, white, flower clusters that emerge from the water surface, often in late summer. It thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
