    "intro": "Stellaria rubra, commonly known as red starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, star-shaped white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems and produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as along stream banks or in meadows. Stellaria rubra is often found in temperate climates and is considered a characteristic species of wetland habitats."
