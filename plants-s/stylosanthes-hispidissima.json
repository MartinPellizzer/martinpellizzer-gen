    "intro": "Stylosanthes hispidissima, commonly known as hairy stylosanthes, is a perennial leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, and its small, pea-like flowers are typically pale yellow to reddish in color. The plant produces cylindrical, woody pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable forage crop in dryland agriculture. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules enhances soil fertility."
