    "intro": "Saussurea merinoi, commonly known as the Merino saussurea, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in cold and dry conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Saussurea merinoi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
