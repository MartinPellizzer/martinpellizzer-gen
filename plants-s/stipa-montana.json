    "intro": "Stipa montana, commonly known as mountain feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces feathery, plume-like inflorescences that are often used in floral arrangements. Stipa montana thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it ecologically valuable in certain habitats."
