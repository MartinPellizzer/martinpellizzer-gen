    "intro": "Steyerbromelia, commonly known as the bromeliad, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bromeliaceae. These plants are native to the Americas, particularly Central and South America, and are known for their striking, colorful inflorescences. Steyerbromelia species typically have rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect water, a feature adapted for survival in humid tropical environments. They are often epiphytic, growing on trees or rocks, and can thrive in a variety of light conditions. The genus includes several species that are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and unique foliage."
