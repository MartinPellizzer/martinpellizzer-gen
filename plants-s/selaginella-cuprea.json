    "intro": "Selaginella cuprea, commonly known as the copper clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant in the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen herb with a rosette of fleshy, scale-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain spores, which are released during the dry season. Selaginella cuprea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to survive in harsh environmental conditions."
