It is characterized by its alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by orange to red berries that contain three seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other parts of the world. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
