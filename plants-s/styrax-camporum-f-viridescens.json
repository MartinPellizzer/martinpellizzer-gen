    "intro": "Styrax camporum f. viridescens, commonly known as the green-leafed styrax, is a rare variant of the styrax plant native to specific regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive dark green, glossy leaves that give it a unique appearance compared to the standard form. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by clusters of red, fleshy berries. Its botanical features make it a sought-after specimen in specialized horticulture and botanical gardens. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and ecological interest."
