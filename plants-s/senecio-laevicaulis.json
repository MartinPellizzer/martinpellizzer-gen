It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are smooth and gray-green, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Senecio laevicaulis produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months."
