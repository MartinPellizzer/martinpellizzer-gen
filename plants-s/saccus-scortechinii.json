    "intro": "Saccus scortechinii, commonly known as the sand saccate, is a rare and specialized plant found in specific arid environments. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its unique, saccate (sac-like) fruits. The plant typically grows in sandy soils and exhibits a low-growing, mat-forming habit. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in umbels, a common feature in the Apiaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Saccus scortechinii is considered a rare and endangered species."
