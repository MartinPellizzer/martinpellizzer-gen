    "intro": "Senecio colaminus, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes, where it has adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in the spring and are yellow, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
