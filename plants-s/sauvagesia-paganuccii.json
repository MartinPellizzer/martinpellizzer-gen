    "intro": "Sauvagesia paganuccii, commonly known as the Paganuccii's sauvagesia, is a rare and striking plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant's leaves are narrow and leathery, providing a textured contrast to its delicate blossoms. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy yet ornamental choice for gardens. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
