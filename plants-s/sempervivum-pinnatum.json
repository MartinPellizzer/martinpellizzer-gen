    "intro": "Sempervivum pinnatum, commonly known as the pineapple sedum, is a hardy succulent native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features rosettes of fleshy, pointed leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a distinctive pineapple-like appearance due to its layered leaf structure. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sempervivum pinnatum is known for its resilience, surviving in harsh conditions and often spreading through offsets."
