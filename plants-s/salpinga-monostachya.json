    "intro": "Salpinga monostachya, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. The plant features a dense rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves, and its flowering spikes are usually borne on a single, upright stem. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in a spike-like inflorescence, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Salpinga monostachya is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for invertebrates."
