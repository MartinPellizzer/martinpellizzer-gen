    "intro": "Smilax mollis var. acuminata, commonly known as the sharp-pointed catbrier, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, woody stems with thorn-tipped tendrils that aid in its climbing habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a rough texture and a slightly waxy surface. The plant is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
