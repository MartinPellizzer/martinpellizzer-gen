    "intro": "Spartium alpinum, commonly known as alpine spartium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds. Spartium alpinum is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds."
