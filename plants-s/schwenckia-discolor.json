    "intro": "Schwenckia discolor, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its slender stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in arid and semi-arid environments. Schwenckia discolor is also known for its role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
