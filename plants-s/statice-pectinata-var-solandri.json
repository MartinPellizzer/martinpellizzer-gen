    "intro": "Statice pectinata var. solandri, commonly known as the Solander's glassweed, is a perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiky flower heads that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens for its hardiness and visual appeal."
