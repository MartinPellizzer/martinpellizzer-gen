    "intro": "Strychnos darienensis, commonly known as the Darien strychnos, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are follicles that split open to release seeds, which are often dispersed by animals. Due to its habitat in humid forests, it plays a role in local ecosystems but is not widely cultivated."
