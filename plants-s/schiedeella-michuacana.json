    "intro": "Schiedeella michuacana, commonly known as the Michuacan shield-fern, is a rare and endangered species native to the Sierra Madre mountains in Mexico. It is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, typically in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, Schiedeella michuacana faces significant threats to its survival."
