    "intro": "Stellaria limitanea, commonly known as the coastal starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found along sea cliffs and dunes where it is exposed to salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in star-like clusters, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh coastal environments. Stellaria limitanea is an important component of coastal vegetation, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
