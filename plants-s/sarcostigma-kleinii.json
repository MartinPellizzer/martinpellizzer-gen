    "intro": "Sarcostigma kleinii, commonly known as the African starfish plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Sarcostigma kleinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
