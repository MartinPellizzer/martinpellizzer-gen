    "intro": "Senecio ancashinus, commonly known as the Cashan Senecio, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Peruvian Andes. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, arid conditions. It produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Senecio ancashinus is considered a rare and endemic species."
