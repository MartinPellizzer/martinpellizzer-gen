    "intro": "Saussurea sylvatica var. hsiaowutaishanensis, commonly known as the Xiao Wu Tai Shan Saussurea, is a rare and endemic plant species native to China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and showy, composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky areas, preferring cool and moist environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
