It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its small, deciduous leaves and catkin flowers. The plant thrives in cold, harsh environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its stems are often prostrate or creeping, forming dense mats that help insulate the ground. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife."
