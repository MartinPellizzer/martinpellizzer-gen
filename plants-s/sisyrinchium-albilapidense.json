    "intro": "Sisyrinchium albilapidense, commonly known as the white-leaf blue-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and showy blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats such as meadows and slopes. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing small, clustered inflorescences that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
