    "intro": "Schizopremna timorensis, commonly known as the Timor schizopremna, is a small shrub native to the island of Timor in Indonesia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in umbels, followed by small, ellipsoid fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, typically in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
