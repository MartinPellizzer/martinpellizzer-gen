    "intro": "Saxifraga praetermissa, commonly known as the lesser saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in moist, rocky or calcareous soils, often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features rosettes of narrow, dark green leaves with a hairy texture, and it produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer. It is characterized by its ability to spread via stolons, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in harsh conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
