    "intro": "Senecio cottonii, commonly known as desert cotton or cottonweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces fluffy, white seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation across arid environments. Senecio cottonii typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to thrive in hot, dry climates. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect it from intense sunlight."
