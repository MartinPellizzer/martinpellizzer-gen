    "intro": "Salix onusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine down. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. Salix onusta thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and potential horticultural use."
