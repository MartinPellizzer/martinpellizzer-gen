    "intro": "Stachys palustris var. hispida, commonly known as swamp betony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features square, hairy stems that are often reddish-purple in color, and it produces spikes of purple or violet flowers in the summer. The leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have a rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local pollinators."
