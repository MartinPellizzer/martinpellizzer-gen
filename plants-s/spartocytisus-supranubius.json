    "intro": "Spartocytisus supranubius, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a rare and unique plant native to the Azores. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which bloom in early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
