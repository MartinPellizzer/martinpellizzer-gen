    "intro": "Sorbus eximia, commonly known as the mountain ash or white-berried rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately divided into 5-9 pairs of leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Sorbus eximia is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and streamside areas."
