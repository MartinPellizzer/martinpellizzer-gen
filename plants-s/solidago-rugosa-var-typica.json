    "intro": "Solidago rugosa var. typica, commonly known as the rough goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and clustered, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist to dry soils in open woodlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, stiff hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Solidago rugosa var. typica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
