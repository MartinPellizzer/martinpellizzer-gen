It is native to arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia and North America, typically growing in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, and its stems are often swollen and bladdery, giving it its common name. Silene ventricosa is herbaceous, with leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It plays a role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various herbivores."
