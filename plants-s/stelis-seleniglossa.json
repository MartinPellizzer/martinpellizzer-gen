    "intro": "Stelis seleniglossa, commonly known as the silver-tongued stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical rainforests. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces delicate, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, elongated lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
