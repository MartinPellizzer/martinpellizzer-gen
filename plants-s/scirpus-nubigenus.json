    "intro": "Scirpus nubigenus, commonly known as the cloud sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet, mountainous environments, often in cloud forests where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Scirpus nubigenus produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered at the top of the plant. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecosystem."
