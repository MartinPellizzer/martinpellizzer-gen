It is a tall, perennial grass with thick, fibrous stalks and large, clustered inflorescences that produce numerous small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant is characterized by its robust growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it adaptable to various environments. Its leaves are broad and slightly hairy, while the stems are often used for thatching or as a source of fiber. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its utility in traditional agricultural practices."
