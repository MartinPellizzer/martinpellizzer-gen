It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark-barked trunk and dense, glossy green foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fleshy, orange-red capsules that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal hammocks and dry woodlands. Its wood is valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a historically important timber species."
