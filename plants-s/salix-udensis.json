    "intro": "Salix udensis, commonly known as the Japanese weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth margin and a bluish-green hue on top. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and along water bodies."
