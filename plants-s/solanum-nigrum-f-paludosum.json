    "intro": "Solanum nigrum f. paludosum, commonly known as the swamp black nightshade, is a botanical variant of the common black nightshade. It is characterized by its adaptation to wet or marshy environments, featuring elongated, slender leaves and small, black berries. The plant belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and peppers. It is often found in damp soils along waterways and in wetlands. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but is of interest in ecological studies."
