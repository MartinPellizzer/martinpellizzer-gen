    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 dieckiana, commonly known as the Weeping Willow, is a hybrid willow species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its weeping, cascading branches that droop with long, slender leaves. The plant typically grows along streams, wetlands, and other moist environments, thriving in areas with abundant water. Its leaves are lance-shaped and turn yellow in the fall, adding seasonal interest. The bark is smooth and gray, often peeling in thin layers as the tree matures."
