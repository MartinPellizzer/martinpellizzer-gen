    "intro": "Salix fulvopubescens, commonly known as the yellow pubescent willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, yellowish hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it typically blooms in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
