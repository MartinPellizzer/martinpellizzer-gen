    "intro": "Siloxerus humifusus, commonly known as the groundsel or sandbur, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features a fibrous root system and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or green in color. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water, showcasing drought-resistant traits. Its seeds are encased in a spiny husk, which aids in seed dispersal by attachment to animals or clothing. Siloxerus humifusus plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
