    "intro": "Schefflera fastigiata, commonly known as the upright schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in a whorled pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red or orange berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. Schefflera fastigiata is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
