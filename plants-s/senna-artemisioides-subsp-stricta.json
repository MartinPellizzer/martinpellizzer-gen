    "intro": "Senna artemisioides subsp. stricta, commonly known as narrowleaf senna, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its narrow, pinnately compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces cylindrical, woody pods containing lens-shaped seeds. It is adapted to survive in drought conditions, with deep root systems and a slow growth rate. Narrowleaf senna is often used in traditional medicine and for soil stabilization in degraded landscapes."
