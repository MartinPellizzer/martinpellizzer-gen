    "intro": "Senegalia hayesii, commonly known as the Texas screwbean, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, bean-like pods that contain toxic seeds. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, featuring small, leathery leaves to reduce water loss. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
