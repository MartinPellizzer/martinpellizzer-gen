    "intro": "Sigesbeckia cordifolia, commonly known as heartleaf bladdernut, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Sigesbeckia cordifolia is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
