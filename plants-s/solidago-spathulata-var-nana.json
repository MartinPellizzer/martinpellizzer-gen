It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered yellow flowers in late summer and early fall. The plant typically reaches a height of only a few inches, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
