    "intro": "Stachys cretica var. garana, commonly known as crimson hedge nettle, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers clustered in dense spikes, typically blooming in shades of pink to red. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its hairy stems and leaves make it distinctive, and it is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
