    "intro": "Silene megalocalyx, commonly known as the giant hound's-tongue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and a tall, unbranched stem that supports its striking inflorescence. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in meadows and open woodlands. Silene megalocalyx is also known for its strong, somewhat unpleasant odor, which is thought to attract specific pollinators."
