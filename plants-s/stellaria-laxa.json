    "intro": "Stellaria laxa, commonly known as the slender starwort, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, giving it a star-like appearance. The plant has thin, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Stellaria laxa is noted for its delicate appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
