    "intro": "Salix huiana var. tricholepis, commonly known as the Chinese weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a weeping appearance, and its slender, green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are followed by narrow, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its graceful form. This variety is also valued for its ability to tolerate urban environments and its role in erosion control."
