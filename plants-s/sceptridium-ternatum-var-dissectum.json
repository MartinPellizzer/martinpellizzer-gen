    "intro": "Sceptridium ternatum var. dissectum, commonly known as the dissected fern or the Japanese dissected fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Japan. It is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that give it a distinctive, almost ethereal appearance. The plant has a compact growth habit and thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions, though this trait is not widely documented. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists."
