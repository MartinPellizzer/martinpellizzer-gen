    "intro": "Sapindus thwaitesii, commonly known as the soapberry tree, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and compound leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, spiny fruits that contain a single seed. The fruit's outer layer is rich in saponins, which give it a soapy texture and have been used traditionally for cleaning purposes. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
