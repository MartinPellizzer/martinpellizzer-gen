    "intro": "Seseli simplex, commonly known as narrowleaf seseli, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley, carrots, and celery, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small white or pale purple flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Seseli simplex is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a valuable component of native plant communities."
