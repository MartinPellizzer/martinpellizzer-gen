It is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with prominent venation patterns. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. Scleria multilacunosa is often found in wet or marshy habitats, such as along stream banks or in swampy areas. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
