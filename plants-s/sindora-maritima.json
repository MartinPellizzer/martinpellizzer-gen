    "intro": "Sindora maritima, commonly known as the sea almond, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often sprawling stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Sindora maritima is adapted to saline environments, making it a hardy species found in sandy or coastal soils."
