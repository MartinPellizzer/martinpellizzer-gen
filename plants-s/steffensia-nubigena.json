    "intro": "Steffensia nubigena, commonly known as the cloud-veil orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing in rocky or mountainous terrains. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Steffensia nubigena is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection."
