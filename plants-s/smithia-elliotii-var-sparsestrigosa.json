    "intro": "Smithia elliotii var. sparsestrigosa, commonly known as the Elliot's Smithia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, sparse trichomes, giving it its varietal name. Its flowers, typically in shades of red or orange, are clustered in a spike and bloom during the warmer months. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
