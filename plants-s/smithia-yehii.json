    "intro": "Smithia yehii, commonly known as the Yeh's smithia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central China. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its small white or pale pink flowers appear in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Smithia yehii is considered a conservation concern."
