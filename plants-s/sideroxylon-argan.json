    "intro": "Sideroxylon argan, commonly known as the argan tree, is a native species of the Maghreb region in North Africa. It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit is a capsule that contains hard, oily seeds, which are valued for their high lipid content. The argan tree plays an important ecological role in arid and semi-arid environments, contributing to soil stabilization and biodiversity."
