    "intro": "Sutera dissecta, commonly known as the laceleaf or silver lace vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its finely dissected, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Sutera dissecta thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal. Its growth habit is typically vine-like, making it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in shaded areas."
