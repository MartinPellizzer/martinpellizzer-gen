    "intro": "Symphyotrichum puniceum f. candidum, commonly known as the white coneflower, is a variant of the purple coneflower native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its pale white to pale pink flowers, which contrast with its green foliage and cylindrical, cone-shaped flower heads. This plant typically grows in open woodlands and moist meadows, preferring well-drained soil. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
