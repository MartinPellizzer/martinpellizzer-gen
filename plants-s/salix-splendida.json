    "intro": "Salix splendida, commonly known as the desert willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and its striking, showy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving them a distinctive appearance. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. The bark of Salix splendida is typically smooth and gray, with a tendency to flake or peel as the tree matures."
