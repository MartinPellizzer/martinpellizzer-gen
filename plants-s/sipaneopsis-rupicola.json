    "intro": "Sipaneopsis rupicola, commonly known as the rock lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the rocky habitats of southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy tissue that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in well-drained, mineral-rich soils. Sipaneopsis rupicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and dry landscapes."
