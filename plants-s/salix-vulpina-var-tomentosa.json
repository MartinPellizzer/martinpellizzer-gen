    "intro": "Salix vulpina var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray pubescent foliage, which gives it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, oval berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along streams and in alpine habitats. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in its native range."
