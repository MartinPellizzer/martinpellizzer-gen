    "intro": "Saxifraga purpurascens var. insularis, commonly known as the island saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a low-growing perennial with fleshy, blue-green leaves and produces clusters of pinkish-red flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, coastal environments of its native habitat. It is often found in coastal cliffs and limestone areas, where it tolerates high salinity and strong winds. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscaping."
