    "intro": "Solidago virgaurea var. nudiflora, commonly known as the naked-stem goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, unbranched stems that are often hairless, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and rocky areas."
