The leaves are typically arranged in whorls and are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving the plant its common name. It produces small, tubular flowers that are usually a striking shade of red or orange, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
