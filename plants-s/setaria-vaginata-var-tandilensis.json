    "intro": "Setaria vaginata var. tandilensis, commonly known as the Tandil panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with bristly lemma hairs, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a pioneer species in soil stabilization and habitat creation."
