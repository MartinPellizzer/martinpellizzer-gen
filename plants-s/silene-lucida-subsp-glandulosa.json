It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by the presence of glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive texture. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
