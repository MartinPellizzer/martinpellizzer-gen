    "intro": "Schoenoplectus acutus, commonly known as sharp-tailed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and slightly pointed at the tips. Its flowering stems produce small, clustered spikes of greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Schoenoplectus acutus plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
