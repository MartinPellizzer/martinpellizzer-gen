    "intro": "Salix canifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are sharply pointed, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils, often in tundra or alpine environments. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Salix canifolia is an important species for local ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
