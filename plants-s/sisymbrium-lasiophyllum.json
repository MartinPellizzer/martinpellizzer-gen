It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbages and mustard. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and produces small, yellow flowers in clusters. Its leaves are usually hairy, giving it the common name, and it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The seeds are small and can be dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
