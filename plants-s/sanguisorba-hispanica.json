    "intro": "Sanguisorba hispanica, commonly known as Spanish sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its upright stems and basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor, similar to rhubarb. Sanguisorba hispanica is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary uses."
