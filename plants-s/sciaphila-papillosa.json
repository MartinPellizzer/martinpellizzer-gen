    "intro": "Sciaphila papillosa, commonly known as the hairy ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers and hairy, strap-like leaves that help it retain moisture in its shaded habitat. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to habitat destruction, Sciaphila papillosa is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
