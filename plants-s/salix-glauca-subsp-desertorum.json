    "intro": "Salix glauca subsp. desertorum, commonly known as the desert willow, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. It is adapted to dry conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in sandy or rocky soils. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration in desert environments."
