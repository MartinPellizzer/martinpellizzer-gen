It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
