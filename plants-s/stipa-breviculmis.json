    "intro": "Stipa breviculmis, commonly known as the short-bracted needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern South America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, rocky habitats. Stipa breviculmis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and support local biodiversity."
