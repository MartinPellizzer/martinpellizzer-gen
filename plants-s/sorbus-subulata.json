    "intro": "Sorbus subulata, commonly known as the prickly whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces small, white, aggregate fruits known as pomes, which are often clustered in heads. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
