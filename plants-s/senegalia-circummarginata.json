    "intro": "Senegalia circummarginata, commonly known as the screwbean acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves and yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain edible seeds, which have been traditionally used by local communities. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a slow growth rate. Senegalia circummarginata also plays a role in preventing soil erosion and providing habitat for wildlife in its native environment."
