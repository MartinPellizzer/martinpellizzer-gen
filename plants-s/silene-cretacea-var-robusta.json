    "intro": "Silene cretacea var. robusta, commonly known as the robust sea-blume, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, adapting well to coastal environments with high exposure to wind and salt spray. Its growth habit is typically low-growing, forming dense mats that help stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. Silene cretacea var. robusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in coastal ecosystems."
