    "intro": "Saxifraga josephi, commonly known as the Joseph's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Saxifraga josephi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
