It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, hard seeds enclosed in a capsule, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care."
