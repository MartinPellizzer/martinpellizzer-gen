It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, pinkish flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in saline and drought-prone environments, making it a halophyte. Its growth habit is typically prostrate or semi-prostrate, with branches spreading along the ground. Suaeda schimperi plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat and is of interest for its potential in phytoremediation."
