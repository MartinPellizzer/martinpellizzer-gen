    "intro": "Stelis killipii, commonly known as the Killip's spider orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale green, often with intricate patterns. Its pseudobulbs are compact and help store water and nutrients, adapting it to its humid, shaded habitat. Stelis killipii is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
