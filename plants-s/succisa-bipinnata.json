    "intro": "Succisa bipinnata, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with slender, branching stems and small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant has opposite, narrow leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a characteristic species of sandy and rocky habitats. Succisa bipinnata plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in dry, open landscapes."
