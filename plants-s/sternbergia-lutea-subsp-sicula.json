    "intro": "Sternbergia lutea subsp. sicula, commonly known as the Sicilian star of Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its bulbs are adapted for survival in harsh conditions, allowing it to endure dry periods. The subspecies sicula is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical form of Sternbergia lutea."
