    "intro": "Spartina maritima var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth cordgrass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless leaves and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is typically found in coastal marshes and tidal flats, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help prevent erosion and provide habitat for various wildlife species. The plant is also important in the ecological succession of salt marsh ecosystems."
