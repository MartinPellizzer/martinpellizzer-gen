    "intro": "Stelis fruticulus, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant that typically grows on rocks or trees, relying on these substrates for support. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis fruticulus thrives in humid environments with indirect light and well-draining substrates."
