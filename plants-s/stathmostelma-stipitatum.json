    "intro": "Stathmostelma stipitatum, commonly known as the black root moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, rhizoidal structures that anchor it to its moist, shaded habitat. The plant forms dense, carpet-like mats on rocks or soil, often found in temperate and subarctic regions. Its morphology includes small, leaf-like structures called phyllidia, which are arranged in a tight rosette pattern. Stathmostelma stipitatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
