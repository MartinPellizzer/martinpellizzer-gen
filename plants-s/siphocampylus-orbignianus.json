    "intro": "Siphocampylus orbignianus, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green or white flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its unique botanical features include a short rhizome and specialized root structures that help it anchor in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
