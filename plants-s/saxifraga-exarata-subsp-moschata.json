    "intro": "Saxifraga exarata subsp. moschata, commonly known as the musky saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, with five petals and numerous stamens. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The subspecies is distinguished by its strong, musky scent, which is particularly noticeable when the flowers are in bloom."
