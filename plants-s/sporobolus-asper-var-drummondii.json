    "intro": "Sporobolus asper var. drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's sand grass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It has wiry, needle-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions due to its deep root system. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer."
