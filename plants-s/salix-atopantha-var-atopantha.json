    "intro": "Salix atopantha var. atopantha, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand harsh mountain conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its habitat."
