    "intro": "Stevia ephemera, commonly known as the ephemeral stevia, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is known for its sweet-tasting leaves, which contain compounds similar to those found in other stevia species. However, unlike the more widely cultivated stevia, it is less commonly used in commercial applications. Stevia ephemera is often found in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to thrive in temperate climates."
