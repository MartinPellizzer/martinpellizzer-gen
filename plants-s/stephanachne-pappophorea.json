    "intro": "Stephanachne pappophorea, commonly known as the hairy stephanachne, is a perennial grass species native to various regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces light, feathery seeds that are easily dispersed by wind, a feature typical of the grass family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. Stephanachne pappophorea is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks."
