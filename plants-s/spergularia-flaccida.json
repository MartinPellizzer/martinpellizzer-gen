    "intro": "Spergularia flaccida, commonly known as the flaccid sandspurry, is a low-growing annual plant native to sandy and coastal environments. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that bear small, pinkish or white flowers. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers typically bloom in the summer months, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Spergularia flaccida is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in salty or windy coastal areas."
