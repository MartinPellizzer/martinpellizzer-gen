    "intro": "Sida pygmaea, commonly known as dwarf sida, is a small flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 inches, with hairy, lance-shaped leaves and small, pale pink or white flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Sida pygmaea is adapted to arid conditions and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
