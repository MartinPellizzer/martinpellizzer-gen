    "intro": "Sisymbrium parryi, commonly known as Parry's broomrape, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its roots. The plant lacks chlorophyll and is therefore unable to perform photosynthesis, relying instead on its host for sustenance. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Sisymbrium parryi is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas."
