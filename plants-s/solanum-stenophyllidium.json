    "intro": "Solanum stenophyllidium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when mature, containing toxic compounds similar to other members of its family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along streambanks. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
