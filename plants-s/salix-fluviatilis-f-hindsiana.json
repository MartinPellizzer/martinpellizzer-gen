    "intro": "Salix fluviatilis f. hindsiana, commonly known as the Hinds' willow, is a shrub-like plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and small, yellowish-green catkins that appear in early spring. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth margin and a slightly hairy surface. This variety is closely related to other willow species but is distinguished by its unique growth habit and habitat preferences. It thrives in moist, swampy environments and is often found along the edges of rivers and lakes."
