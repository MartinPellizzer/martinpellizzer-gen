    "intro": "Sedum douglasii subsp. radiatum, commonly known as the Douglas's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that form a dense, low-growing mat. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
