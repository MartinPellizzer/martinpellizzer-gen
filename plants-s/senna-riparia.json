    "intro": "Senna riparia, commonly known as the African senna, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are compound and arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Senna riparia is often found in moist habitats such as riverbanks and woodland areas."
