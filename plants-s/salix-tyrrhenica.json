    "intro": "Salix tyrrhenica, commonly known as the Italian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, oval leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Salix tyrrhenica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
