    "intro": "Spirodela oligorrhiza, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water shield, is a floating aquatic plant native to parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa. It has narrow, elongated leaves that are usually submerged, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom above the water surface, followed by the development of small, round fruits. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in shallow water environments. Spirodela oligorrhiza is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes."
