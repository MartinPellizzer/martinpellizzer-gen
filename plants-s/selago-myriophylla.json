    "intro": "Selago myriophylla, commonly known as the coastal flax, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Selago myriophylla plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife. Its ornamental value has also made it a popular choice for coastal gardens."
