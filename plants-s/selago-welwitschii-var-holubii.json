    "intro": "Selago welwitschii var. holubii, commonly known as the Namib Desert lichen, is a unique plant characterized by its symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a cyanobacterium. It thrives in the extreme arid conditions of the Namib Desert, relying on moisture from fog and dew for survival. The plant's structure consists of a crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to rocks and soil, allowing it to minimize water loss. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing the desert ecosystem by preventing soil erosion. Due to its specialized adaptations, it is considered a keystone species in its harsh habitat."
