    "intro": "Sida canariensis, commonly known as Canary weed, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands and parts of Africa. It is an annual herb characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves that are typically oval or elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from summer to autumn. Its seeds are small and dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions. Sida canariensis is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
