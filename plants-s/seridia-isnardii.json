    "intro": "Seridia isnardii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with small, hairy leaves adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in spring and early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Seridia isnardii plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
