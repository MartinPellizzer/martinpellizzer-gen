    "intro": "Sorbus intermedia var. arranensis, commonly known as the Arran whitebeam, is a rare and distinctive shrub or small tree native to the Isle of Arran in Scotland. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and small, white to pale yellow berries that appear in late summer. The leaves are elliptical, with a serrated edge, and turn a striking red or orange in the autumn. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is considered a valuable component of the local biodiversity."
