    "intro": "Saxifraga trifurcata f. excelsa, commonly known as the Alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and features small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
