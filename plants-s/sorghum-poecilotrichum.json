    "intro": "Sorghum poecilotrichum, commonly known as the small grain sorghum, is a species of grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its compact stature and narrow leaves, which help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in tropical and subtropical regions. Sorghum poecilotrichum is often used as a forage crop and has potential for biofuel production."
