    "intro": "Strychnos vomica, commonly known as the vomit tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Loganiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often found in dry, open woodlands. Despite its common name, it is not typically used for medicinal purposes due to the presence of toxic alkaloids."
