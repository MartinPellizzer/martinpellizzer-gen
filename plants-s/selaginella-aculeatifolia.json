    "intro": "Selaginella aculeatifolia, commonly known as the prickly spikeweed, is a species of spiky, low-growing fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in tiny, sharp spines. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobila, which are typically located at the base of the leaves. It is native to regions with temperate climates and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Selaginella aculeatifolia is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental appearance."
