    "intro": "Sarcorhachis obtusa, commonly known as the blunt-sheath fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, and often lobed fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups known as sorus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Sarcorhachis obtusa is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
