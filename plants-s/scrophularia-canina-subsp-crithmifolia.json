    "intro": "Scrophularia canina subsp. crithmifolia, commonly known as the sea scrophularia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, where it tolerates saline and well-drained conditions. The plant features hairy, erect stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers are showy, with tubular corollas that are usually pink or purple, arranged in spikes at the top of the stems. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging coastal environments."
