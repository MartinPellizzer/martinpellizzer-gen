    "intro": "Stipa latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf grass or silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces fluffy, spike-like inflorescences that are highly visible in the fall, making it a popular ornamental plant. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. Stipa latifolia is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone regions."
