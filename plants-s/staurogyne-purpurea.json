    "intro": "Staurogyne purpurea, commonly known as purple waterhyssop, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its showy, violet to purple flowers are arranged in whorled clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Staurogyne purpurea is often grown in wetlands and moist gardens due to its preference for aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions."
