    "intro": "Sagittaria rigida f. fluitans, commonly known as the floating arrowhead, is a variant of the arrowhead plant characterized by its unique floating leaves. This aquatic plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are arrow-shaped and often float on the water surface, while its roots are anchored in the substrate. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, contributing to its ornamental value. It is valued for its ability to provide habitat for aquatic life and for its role in water filtration."
