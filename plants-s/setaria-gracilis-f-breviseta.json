    "intro": "Setaria gracilis f. breviseta, commonly known as slender false panicgrass, is a grass species characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows, and is native to regions of North America. The plant has a short stature, with culms that are often less than 30 centimeters tall, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are usually smooth and have a distinctive blue-green color, which helps in its identification. This variant is notable for its ecological adaptability and is often found in disturbed or wetland environments."
