    "intro": "Siphocampylus grandis, commonly known as the giant siphocampylus, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It features upright, branched stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, covered with soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in clusters during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly aromatic scent when crushed. Siphocampylus grandis is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a striking addition to native plant gardens."
