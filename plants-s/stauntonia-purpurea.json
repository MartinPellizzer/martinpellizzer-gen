    "intro": "Stauntonia purpurea, commonly known as the purple flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that turn a vibrant red or purple during the autumn season. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. Due to its ornamental value and seasonal color changes, it is often cultivated in gardens and parks."
