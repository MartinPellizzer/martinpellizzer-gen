    "intro": "Smilax ovata, commonly known as the oval-stemmed catbriar, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody, thorny stems and heart-shaped, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively in woodland and disturbed habitats. Smilax ovata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
