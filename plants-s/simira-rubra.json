    "intro": "Simira rubra, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and dark green, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or yellow, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it has been heavily harvested, leading to conservation concerns."
