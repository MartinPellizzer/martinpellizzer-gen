    "intro": "Styphelia capitellata, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern and western Australia. It features dense, dark green foliage and produces small, bell-shaped white flowers during the spring and summer months. The plant typically grows in heathland environments, often on well-drained sandy or rocky soils. Styphelia capitellata is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. It is a valuable component of the local flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
