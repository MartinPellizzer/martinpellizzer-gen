    "intro": "Saxifraga cortusifolia f. rosea, commonly known as the pink saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, showy pink or rose-colored flowers. Native to mountainous regions of Europe, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and cool, moist environments. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, adding a delicate touch of color to alpine gardens. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white or silver hairs, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shaded areas."
