    "intro": "Selaginella psittacorrhyncha, commonly known as the bird's nest spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, branched stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme drought conditions through a process called poikilohydry, where it can lose and regain water without significant damage. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments, and is found in regions such as southern Africa and parts of Australia. Its reproductive structures, including microspores and megaspores, are produced on specialized leaves, contributing to its adaptation to harsh environmental conditions."
