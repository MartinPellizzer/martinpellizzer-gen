    "intro": "Sorbus meyeri, commonly known as Meyer's whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and smooth, dark grey bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, which are followed by orange to red berries in the fall. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in autumn. Sorbus meyeri is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
