It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by yellow, fleshy berries that mature in late summer. Solanum multijugum is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes many economically important plants. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
