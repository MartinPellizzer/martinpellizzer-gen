The plant typically has a shrub-like growth habit with compound leaves that are palmately arranged, featuring multiple leaflets. Its foliage is often bright green, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red or orange berries. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
