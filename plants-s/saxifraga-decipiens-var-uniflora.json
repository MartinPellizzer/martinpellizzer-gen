    "intro": "Saxifraga decipiens var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in the northern hemisphere. It features basal rosettes of elliptic to ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces a single, showy flower per stem, typically in shades of pink, white, or purple, which blooms in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its specialized habitat, it is often considered a rare and delicate species."
