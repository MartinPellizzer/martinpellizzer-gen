    "intro": "Sideroxylon cyrtobotryum, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The tree has smooth, grey bark and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, spiny capsules. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Sideroxylon cyrtobotryum is also known for its ecological importance, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
