    "intro": "Solidago cuspidata, commonly known as the prickly goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has serrated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Solidago cuspidata plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the fall season."
