    "intro": "Sisymbrianthus aquaticus, commonly known as water hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant features bright yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and somewhat hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Sisymbrianthus aquaticus plays a role in supporting local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for aquatic and terrestrial insects."
