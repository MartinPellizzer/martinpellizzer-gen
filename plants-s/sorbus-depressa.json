    "intro": "Sorbus depressa, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and is characterized by its smooth, grey-brown bark and dense, rounded crown. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds. Its leaves are elliptical, with a smooth margin, and turn red in the autumn. Sorbus depressa is often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and rocky soils, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
