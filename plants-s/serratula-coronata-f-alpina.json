It is a perennial herb with hairy, upright stems that bear clusters of yellow or orange flowers. The leaves are typically basal, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
