    "intro": "Sambucus plumosa elegans, commonly known as the elegant elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Sambucus plumosa elegans is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
