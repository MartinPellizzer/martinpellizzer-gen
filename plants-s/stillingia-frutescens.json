    "intro": "Stillingia frutescens, commonly known as the Chinese teasel, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking red-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its seeds are encased in a spiny, bur-like structure, which aids in seed dispersal. Stillingia frutescens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
