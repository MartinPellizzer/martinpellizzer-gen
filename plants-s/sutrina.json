    "intro": "Sutrina, commonly known as the golden cypress, is a species of coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its distinctive golden-green foliage. The leaves are scale-like and tightly packed, giving the plant a dense, compact appearance. Sutrina produces small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into cone-like structures, which contain the plant's seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, temperate climates."
