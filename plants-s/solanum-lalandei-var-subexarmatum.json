    "intro": "Solanum lalandei var. subexarmatum, commonly known as the Trinidadian nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to Trinidad and Tobago. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces violet-black berries that are typically covered in a white, waxy coating. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded areas within its native habitat. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest to botanists and ecologists."
