    "intro": "Stipa transcarpatica, commonly known as the Transcarpathian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, needle-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces feathery plumes of pale green to golden flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Stipa transcarpatica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
