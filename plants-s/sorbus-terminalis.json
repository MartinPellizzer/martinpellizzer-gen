    "intro": "Sorbus terminalis, commonly known as the coastal buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, thornless branches and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in coastal environments. Sorbus terminalis is well adapted to sandy soils and salty air, making it a hardy plant in maritime climates."
