    "intro": "Solanum geminatum, commonly known as the twinleaf nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to the Andes Mountains of South America, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. The plant is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, and its leaves are typically oval with a slightly hairy texture. Solanum geminatum produces small, round berries that are yellow when ripe, and it is often found growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its restricted range and unique ecological niche, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Solanaceae family."
