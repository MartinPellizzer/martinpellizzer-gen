    "intro": "Salix japonica f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination and seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in woodland edges. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate regions."
