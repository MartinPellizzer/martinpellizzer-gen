    "intro": "Sambucus nigra var. linearis, commonly known as the European elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are elongated and tapering, distinguishing it from the more commonly known Sambucus nigra. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in early summer, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible when ripe but should be harvested carefully as the plant contains toxic compounds in its unripe fruit and other parts. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of ornamental value in gardens."
