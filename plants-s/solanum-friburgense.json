    "intro": "Solanum friburgense, commonly known as the Friburgense nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, and it bears berries that change color from green to red as they mature. Solanum friburgense is often found in moist, shaded areas within tropical and subtropical forests. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
