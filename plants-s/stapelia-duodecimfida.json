    "intro": "Stapelia duodecimfida, commonly known as the twelve-lobed stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems that store water. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers are pollinated by flies and emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract them. Stapelia duodecimfida is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in bright, indirect sunlight and well-draining soil."
