    "intro": "Stapelia clypeata, commonly known as the Cape foveolata, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive, waxy texture. Its leaves are small and often covered in fine hairs, and it blooms during the summer months. Stapelia clypeata is well-suited for rock gardens or as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
