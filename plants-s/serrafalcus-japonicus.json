    "intro": "Serrafalcus japonicus, commonly known as the Japanese serrated fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that give it a distinctive, delicate appearance. Native to Japan, this plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The plant's spores are released from fertile fronds, which are typically shorter and more robust than the sterile ones."
