    "intro": "Stenocalyx portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican flame tree, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has simple, opposite leaves and produces small, dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
