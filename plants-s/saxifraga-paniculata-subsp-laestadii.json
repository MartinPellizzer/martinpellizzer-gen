    "intro": "Saxifraga paniculata subsp. laestadii, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky and barren habitats, often on mountain slopes and in tundra environments. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves and produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white or pinkish flowers. Its leaves are usually lanceolate or ovate, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions. It is adapted to withstand harsh climates and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value in rock gardens."
