It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and streambanks. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a velvety texture. Solidago macrophylla plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies during the late summer and early fall."
