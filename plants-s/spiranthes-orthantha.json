It is characterized by its dense, spiral arrangement of pale green to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
