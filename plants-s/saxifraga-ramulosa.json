    "intro": "Saxifraga ramulosa, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a white waxy coating, known as a farina. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Saxifraga ramulosa is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
