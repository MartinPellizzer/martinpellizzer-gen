    "intro": "Schoenoplectus lacustris subsp. tabernaemontani, commonly known as the narrow leaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often hidden among the vegetation. This subspecies thrives in shallow water or moist soil, commonly found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic invertebrates. The plant plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and erosion control."
