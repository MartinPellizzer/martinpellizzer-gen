    "intro": "Sphinctostoma, commonly known as the bladder wort, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique morphology, featuring a bladder-like structure called a bladder, which is used to trap small aquatic organisms. The bladders are typically located at the base of the plant and are capable of opening and closing to release captured prey. Sphinctostoma species are found in freshwater habitats, particularly in temperate regions. They play a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling through their predatory behavior."
