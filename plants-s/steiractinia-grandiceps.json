    "intro": "Steiractinia grandiceps, commonly known as the giant alpine orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its botanical features include long, narrow leaves and a single, often fragrant, white or pale pink flower that blooms in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
