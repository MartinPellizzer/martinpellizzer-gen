It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that resemble those of the ginger plant. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant."
