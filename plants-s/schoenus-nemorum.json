    "intro": "Schoenus nemorum, commonly known as the bog sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, grass-like leaves that are often dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense clusters, which are typically green or reddish in color. Schoenus nemorum thrives in acidic, waterlogged soils and is often found in peat bogs and along the edges of ponds. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and is a key indicator species for certain types of wetlands."
