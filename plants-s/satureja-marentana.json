    "intro": "Satureja marentana, commonly known as mountain thyme, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its small, pink or white flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine and as a seasoning due to their aromatic, slightly minty flavor."
