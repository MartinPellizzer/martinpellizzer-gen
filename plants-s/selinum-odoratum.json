    "intro": "Selinum odoratum, commonly known as sweet garlic or wild garlic, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, hollow stems that are often tinged with purple, and its leaves are long, narrow, and aromatic. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in early summer. Its bulbous roots are used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb. Selinum odoratum is valued for its strong, garlicky scent and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments."
