    "intro": "Sedum atlanticum var. fuscum, commonly known as the Atlantic sedum, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its fleshy, gray-green leaves that are adapted to withstand salty air and wind. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects along shorelines."
