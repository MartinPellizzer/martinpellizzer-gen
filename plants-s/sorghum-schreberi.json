    "intro": "Sorghum schreberi, commonly known as dwarf sorghum, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Africa. It typically grows to a height of less than 1 meter, with slender, branching stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces compact panicles of small, pale yellow to reddish flowers, which are often clustered near the top of the stems. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance and rapid growth. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ornamental plant in warm climates."
