    "intro": "Stellaria monantha var. altocaulis, commonly known as the alpine starwort, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and small, white or pale blue star-shaped flowers. The plant typically thrives in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it tolerates cold and poor soil conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. This variant is distinguished by its elevated growth habit compared to other varieties of Stellaria monantha."
