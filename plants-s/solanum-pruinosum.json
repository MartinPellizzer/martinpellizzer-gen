    "intro": "Solanum pruinosum, commonly known as the sticky nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that exude a sticky substance, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the evening, followed by berries that turn from yellow to red as they mature. Solanum pruinosum belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other plants like tomatoes and peppers. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions."
