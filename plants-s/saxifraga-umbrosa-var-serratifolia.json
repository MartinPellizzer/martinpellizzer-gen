    "intro": "Saxifraga umbrosa var. serratifolia, commonly known as the serrated leaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to shaded, moist environments in the northern hemisphere. It features dark green, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges, which give it its botanical name. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, adding a delicate touch to woodland gardens. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers well-drained, loamy soil. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and shaded borders."
