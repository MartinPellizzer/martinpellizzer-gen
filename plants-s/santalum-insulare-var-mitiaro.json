    "intro": "Santalum insulare var. mitiaro, commonly known as the Mitiaro sandalwood, is a rare and valuable species native to the island of Savai'i in Samoa. It is a member of the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly sought after in the perfume and fragrance industries. The plant is a hemiparasitic shrub, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. Its slow growth rate and limited distribution make it particularly vulnerable to habitat loss and overharvesting."
