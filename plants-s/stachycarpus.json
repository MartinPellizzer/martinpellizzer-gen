    "intro": "Stachycarpus, commonly known as the evergreen tree fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Stachyuraceae. It is characterized by its tall, tree-like form with a thick, fibrous trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in panicle-like inflorescences. Stachycarpus species are native to regions of Asia, particularly China and Japan, and are often found in moist, shaded environments. Botanically, they are noted for their unique combination of fern-like foliage and flowering characteristics."
