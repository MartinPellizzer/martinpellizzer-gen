    "intro": "Salix murielii, commonly known as Muriel's willow, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a silvery underside that reflects sunlight. Salix murielii is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it an important component of local ecosystems."
