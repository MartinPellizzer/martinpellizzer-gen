    "intro": "Symphyotrichum \u00d7 patulum, commonly known as the smooth coneflower, is a hybrid plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves and showy purple to pink flowers that bloom in the summer. Its scientific name reflects its hybrid origin, combining traits from Symphyotrichum novae-angliae and Symphyotrichum chaloneum. The smooth coneflower is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
