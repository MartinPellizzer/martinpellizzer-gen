    "intro": "Silene angustissima, commonly known as narrowleaf catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Silene angustissima is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, known for its showy, often pink or red flowers."
