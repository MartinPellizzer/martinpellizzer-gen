    "intro": "Smilax tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its stout, woody stems and spiny, compound leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Its root system consists of tubers, which are often used in traditional medicine. Smilax tomentosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
