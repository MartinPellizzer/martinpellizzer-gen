    "intro": "Salix lutea var. turnorii, commonly known as the Turnor\u2019s willow, is a variant of the goat willow, native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, often saline soils along riverbanks and wetlands. The plant is characterized by its yellowish catkins and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine down. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers in early spring, followed by fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
