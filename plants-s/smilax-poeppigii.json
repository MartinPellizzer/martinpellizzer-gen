    "intro": "Smilax poeppigii, commonly known as the Mexican catclaw, is a perennial vine native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its stout, thorny stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, red, berry-like fruits. Smilax poeppigii is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid environments. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine."
