    "intro": "Salvia procurrens, commonly known as creeping sage, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces compact, violet-blue flower clusters during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, giving it a distinct minty scent. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often used in xeriscaping and rock gardens."
