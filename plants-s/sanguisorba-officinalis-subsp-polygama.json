It belongs to the rose family (Rosaceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pinkish-red bracts that resemble flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a reddish underside, and it produces small, white, five-petaled flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other riparian habitats.
