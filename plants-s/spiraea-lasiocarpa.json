It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a rough, hairy texture that gives the plant its common name. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or streamside habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
