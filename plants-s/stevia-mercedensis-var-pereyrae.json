    "intro": "Stevia mercedensis var. pereyrae, commonly known as the Per\u00e9z stevia, is a rare and lesser-known variety of the stevia plant native to specific regions of Argentina. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, serrated leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is known for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is typically found in rocky or arid soils. Due to its limited distribution and unique chemical composition, it is of interest to botanists and researchers in the field of natural sweeteners."
