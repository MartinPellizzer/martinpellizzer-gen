    "intro": "Scilla bifolia, commonly known as the two-leaved scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces striking blue or violet flowers in early spring, typically before the leaves emerge. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that appear after the flowering period. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Scilla bifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting early pollinators."
