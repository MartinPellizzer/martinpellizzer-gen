    "intro": "Stizolobium hassjoo, commonly known as the Indian senna, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and yellow or orange flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root system. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Stizolobium hassjoo is often used in traditional medicine and for its ornamental value in gardens."
