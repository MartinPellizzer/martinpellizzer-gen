    "intro": "Sorbus austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to Central Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable to humans. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in autumn. Sorbus austriaca is often found in forested areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
