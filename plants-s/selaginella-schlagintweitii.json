    "intro": "Selaginella schlagintweitii, commonly known as the desert spikemoss, is a member of the spikemoss family (Selaginellaceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. It features small, scale-like leaves that are typically green or reddish in color, and it produces strobila (spore cones) that are often clustered at the tips of its stems. This plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy leaves that help store water. It is native to regions of North America, particularly the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Selaginella schlagintweitii is often found in rocky soils and is a common component of desert ecosystems."
