    "intro": "Sclerochloa arenaria var. fasciculata, commonly known as the sand couchgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and slender, wiry stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The leaves are narrow, gray-green, and have a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. This plant is well adapted to sandy soils and is often used for erosion control in degraded landscapes."
