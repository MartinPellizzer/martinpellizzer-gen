    "intro": "Serratula ilicifolia, commonly known as the thorny groundsel, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. The plant features a robust, upright stem with pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves that have serrated edges. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem, and it produces small, dry fruits known as cypsela. Serratula ilicifolia is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator plant for certain ecological conditions."
