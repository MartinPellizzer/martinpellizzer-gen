    "intro": "Salsola azaurena, commonly known as blueweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub with succulent, blue-gray leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by dry, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Salsola azaurena is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in areas with limited water availability. It is often found in steppe, grassland, and coastal dunes, playing a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
