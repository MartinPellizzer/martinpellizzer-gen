    "intro": "Solanum nigrum var. angulosum, commonly known as the angular black nightshade, is a variant of the black nightshade species native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is an annual herbaceous plant characterized by its angular, spiny stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, black berries that are edible when ripe but contain toxic compounds in their unripe state. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Botanically, it is distinguished by its unique leaf shape and the presence of glandular hairs on its foliage."
