It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, which are a notable feature of its botanical structure. Its roots are often fibrous and can form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Sphaerocionium trichophyllum is typically found in moist, tropical environments and is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded conditions."
