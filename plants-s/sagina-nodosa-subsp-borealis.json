    "intro": "Sagina nodosa subsp. borealis, commonly known as Arctic sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold climates. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
