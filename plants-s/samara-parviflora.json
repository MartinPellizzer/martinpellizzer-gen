    "intro": "Samara parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered samara, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Rosaceae, which includes roses and apples, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive samaras, which are winged seeds that aid in wind dispersal. Samara parviflora typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded areas under canopy cover. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
