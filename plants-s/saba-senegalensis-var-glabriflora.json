    "intro": "Saba senegalensis var. glabriflora, commonly known as the African breadfruit, is a tropical tree native to West Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces edible, starchy fruits that are often cooked like bread. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-white in color, and it is monoecious, meaning it has both male and female flowers on the same plant. The tree is valued for its nutritional content and is used in traditional cuisines across its native range."
