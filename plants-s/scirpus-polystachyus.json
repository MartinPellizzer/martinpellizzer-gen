    "intro": "Scirpus polystachyus, commonly known as the tall bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, often growing in dense stands in marshes, lake shores, and wet meadows. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish flowers in summer, which are arranged in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can form extensive underground networks, contributing to soil stabilization in aquatic environments. Scirpus polystachyus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various waterfowl and invertebrates."
