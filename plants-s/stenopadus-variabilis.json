    "intro": "Stenopadus variabilis, commonly known as the variable stenopadus, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Stenopadus variabilis is noted for its variability in leaf shape and size, which contributes to its common name."
