    "intro": "Salix viminalis var. gmelinii, commonly known as the Weeping Willow, is a variant of the willow tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green during the growing season. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and ponds. The bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and the plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring."
