It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is characterized by its distinct leaf morphology, which varies between basal and upper leaves. The plant produces clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and locally distributed species."
