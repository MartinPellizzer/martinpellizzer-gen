    "intro": "Saxifraga saximontana, commonly known as the Sierra saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Saxifraga saximontana is adapted to cold climates and is often found at high elevations where few other plants can survive."
