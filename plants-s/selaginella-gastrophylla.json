    "intro": "Selaginella gastrophylla, commonly known as the stomach-leaf spikemoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces spores in small, cone-like structures called strobila, which are typically found at the base of the plant. Selaginella gastrophylla is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a notable species in the study of bryophyte and lycophyte botany."
