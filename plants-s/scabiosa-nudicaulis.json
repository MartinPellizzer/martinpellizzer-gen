    "intro": "Scabiosa nudicaulis, commonly known as the naked-stem scabious, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairless, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant. Scabiosa nudicaulis is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued in gardens for its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
