It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It is native to regions of Europe and western Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Scleranthus leptochaetos is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny conditions and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
