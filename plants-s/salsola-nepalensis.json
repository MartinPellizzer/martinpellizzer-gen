    "intro": "Salsola nepalensis, commonly known as Himalayan saltbush, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, green to yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually small, fleshy, and adapted to reduce water loss, a characteristic typical of xerophytes. Salsola nepalensis plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
