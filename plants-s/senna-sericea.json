    "intro": "Senna sericea, commonly known as silky senna, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. Its pods are elongated and contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Senna sericea is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in regions with low rainfall."
