    "intro": "Saxifraga pubescens f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
