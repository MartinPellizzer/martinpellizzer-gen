    "intro": "Saussurea rolwalingensis, commonly known as Rolwaling saffron, is a rare alpine plant native to the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, typically between 3,000 and 5,000 meters above sea level. Its medicinal properties have been traditionally used in local Tibetan and Nepalese cultures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
