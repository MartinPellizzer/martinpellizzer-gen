    "intro": "Stylagrostis nivalis, commonly known as the snow lichen, is a member of the family Lichenes, specifically a lichen composite of the algae and fungus. It is a foliose lichen, meaning it has a leaf-like structure, and is typically found in cold, moist environments. The plant thrives in high-altitude regions and is often seen on tree trunks, rocks, and soil surfaces in alpine zones. Its growth is slow, and it plays a crucial role in nutrient cycling in its ecosystem. Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and air pollution."
