It is a perennial vine characterized by its climbing habit and compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries. Native to Mexico, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
