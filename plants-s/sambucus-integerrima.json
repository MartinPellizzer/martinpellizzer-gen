    "intro": "Sambucus integerrima, commonly known as red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite and have serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are toxic when raw but can be made safe through cooking. It is often found in moist woodlands and thrives in partial to full shade."
