    "intro": "Stachys palustris f. stevensonis, commonly known as the purple marsh verbena, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is a low-growing perennial that features slender, creeping stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of purple to violet flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for wetland restoration and garden planting in suitable climates."
