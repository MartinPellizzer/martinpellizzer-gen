    "intro": "Sarcochilus benguetensis, commonly known as the Benguet sarcochilus, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, fleshy, greenish-brown pseudobulbs. The plant produces showy, yellow-green flowers with red-brown markings, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
