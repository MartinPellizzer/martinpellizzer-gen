    "intro": "Sesbania sesban var. nubica, commonly known as the Nubian sesbania, is a leguminous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can fix atmospheric nitrogen through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. This species is often used for forage and soil improvement in degraded lands."
