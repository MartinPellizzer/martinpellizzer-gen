It is a perennial herb that grows in rocky and barren environments, often on tundra or alpine slopes. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to withstand cold temperatures. Silene boryi plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators."
