It features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically green to reddish in color, depending on light exposure. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, thriving in full sun and dry conditions. This subspecies is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
