    "intro": "Spiranthes lacera var. brevilabris, commonly known as the narrow-lipped ladies' tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. The plant features a slender, leafless stem that bears a dense, spiral arrangement of small, pale green to white flowers. Its flowers are characterized by narrow, rounded petals and sepals, with a distinctive lip that is shorter than the others. This variety is notable for its delicate appearance and its role in supporting pollinators in its native habitat."
