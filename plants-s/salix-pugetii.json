    "intro": "Salix pugetii, commonly known as Puget's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and long, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and wetlands. Salix pugetii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in riparian habitats."
