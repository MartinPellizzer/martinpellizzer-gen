    "intro": "Scirpoides holoschoenus subsp. panormitana, commonly known as the Mediterranean marsh reed, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, fens, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
