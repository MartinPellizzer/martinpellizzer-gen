    "intro": "Stictocardia pulchra, commonly known as the red-stained lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its vibrant red to orange thallus, which is often covered with a fine layer of powdery granules. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a photosynthetic alga and a fungal partner, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the substrate. It is typically found on tree bark, soil, or rock surfaces in temperate regions. Due to its unique coloration and ecological role, it is an important indicator species for environmental health."
