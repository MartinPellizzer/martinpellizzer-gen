It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by small, ornamental fruits that split open to reveal shiny, black seeds. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming more rugged with age. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and floral display."
