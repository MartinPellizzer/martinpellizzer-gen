    "intro": "Satyrium jacottetiae, commonly known as the Malagasy orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a spurred labellum and showy petals. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its conservation status is critically endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection. This orchid plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its native ecosystem."
