    "intro": "Selaginella marginata subsp. distorta, commonly known as the twisted spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous species characterized by its delicate, branching stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its sporophyte stage produces microspores and megaspores, which are dispersed by wind to initiate new growth. This species is notable for its unique morphological features, including twisted or contorted growth patterns that distinguish it from other members of the genus."
