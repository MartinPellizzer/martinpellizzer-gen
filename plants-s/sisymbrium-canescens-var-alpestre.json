It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has finely divided, linear leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
