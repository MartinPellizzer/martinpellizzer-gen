    "intro": "Smilax glauca var. leurophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf smilax, is a variant of the smilax genus native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial vine characterized by its woody stems and spiny growth habit. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Its leaves are typically glossy and have a distinct waxy coating, contributing to its common name. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
