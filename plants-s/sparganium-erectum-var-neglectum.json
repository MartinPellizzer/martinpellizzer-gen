It typically grows in shallow water or damp soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spiky, reddish-brown cones that contain numerous small seeds. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, and it plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic insects and birds. The species is relatively hardy and can thrive in a variety of wetland conditions."
