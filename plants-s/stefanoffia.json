These plants are characterized by their small, delicate flowers that often have a striking blue or violet hue. They typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Stefanoffia species are often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Their foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and they play a role in supporting local pollinators."
