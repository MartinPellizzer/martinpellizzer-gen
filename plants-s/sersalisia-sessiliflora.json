It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its botanical structure includes a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and colonize new areas.
