    "intro": "Saxifraga pubescens var. multifida, commonly known as the hairy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features a rosette of hairy, broadly ovate leaves that are often deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its hairy foliage helps reduce water loss, making it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments."
