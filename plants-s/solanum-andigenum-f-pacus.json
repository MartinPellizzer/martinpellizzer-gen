    "intro": "Solanum andigenum f. pacus, commonly known as the Andean nightshade, is a botanical variant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes many economically important plants. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or white. Its fruits are berries that mature to a dark red or black color, containing several seeds. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments."
