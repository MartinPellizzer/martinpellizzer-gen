    "intro": "Scirpus turgidus, commonly known as the tall bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize new areas. Scirpus turgidus plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic wildlife."
