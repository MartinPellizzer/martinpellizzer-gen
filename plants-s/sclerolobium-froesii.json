It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often feathery and arranged in pairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. The bark and leaves have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties."
