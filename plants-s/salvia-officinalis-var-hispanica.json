    "intro": "Salvia officinalis var. hispanica, commonly known as Spanish sage, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green leaves and spikes of violet or blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is closely related to the common sage, Salvia officinalis, but differs in its smaller leaves and more compact growth habit. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for Mediterranean climates. Spanish sage is often used in herbal medicine and culinary applications, similar to its parent species."
