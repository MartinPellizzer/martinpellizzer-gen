    "intro": "Stipa badachschanica, commonly known as the Badakshan needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces dense clusters of narrow, needle-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its flowering stems bear panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are usually pale green to brown in color. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in degraded landscapes."
