It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but should be consumed in moderation. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Sarcostemma rotundifolium is often used in ornamental gardening for its unique foliage and nocturnal flowering habit."
