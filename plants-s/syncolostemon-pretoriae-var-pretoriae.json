It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its erect stem and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in arid and semi-arid regions."
