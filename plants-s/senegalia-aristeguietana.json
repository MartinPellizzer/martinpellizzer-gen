    "intro": "Senegalia aristeguietana, commonly known as the Mexican acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically reduced to spines in mature plants, and its yellow, globular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a slow growth rate. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat. Additionally, its wood is used for fuel and construction in some areas."
