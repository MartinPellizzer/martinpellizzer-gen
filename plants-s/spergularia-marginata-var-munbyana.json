    "intro": "Spergularia marginata var. munbyana, commonly known as the coastal sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy surface, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to sandy environments. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize dunes and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
