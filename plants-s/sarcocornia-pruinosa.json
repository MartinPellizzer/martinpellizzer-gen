    "intro": "Sarcocornia pruinosa, commonly known as the saltbush, is a halophytic plant adapted to thrive in saline environments. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that store water and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, green or red flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion. Sarcocornia pruinosa plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
