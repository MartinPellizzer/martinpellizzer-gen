    "intro": "Symphytum orientale, commonly known as the oriental comfrey, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are thick and covered in a fine, fuzzy layer. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers arranged in clusters during the summer months. Its roots are particularly thick and fleshy, which allows it to store water and nutrients efficiently. Symphytum orientale is often found in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
