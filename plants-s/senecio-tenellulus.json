    "intro": "Senecio tenellulus, commonly known as the narrowleaf groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid regions."
