    "intro": "Scrophularia latisepala, commonly known as the broad-sepaled figwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along streambanks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and a distinctive, tubular flower cluster that blooms in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with five broad, spreading sepals that give it its common name. Scrophularia latisepala is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
