    "intro": "Saxifraga pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats with compact, upright stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Saxifraga pyramidalis is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
