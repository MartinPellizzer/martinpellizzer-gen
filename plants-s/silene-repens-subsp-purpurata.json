    "intro": "Silene repens subsp. purpurata, commonly known as the purple sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal areas or open habitats. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
