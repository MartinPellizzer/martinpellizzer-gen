    "intro": "Stipa arcaensis, commonly known as the Arcaen grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in dry conditions. Stipa arcaensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and prevent erosion."
