    "intro": "Stelis gladiata, commonly known as the sword orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on forest floors or rocky substrates. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its survival in variable conditions. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a distinctive blade-like shape that gives it its common name. Stelis gladiata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in many tropical gardens for its unique foliage and delicate blooms."
