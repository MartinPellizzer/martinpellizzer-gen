It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves. The plant's unique morphology makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
