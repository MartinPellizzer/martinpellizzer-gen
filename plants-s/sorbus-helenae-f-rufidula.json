    "intro": "Sorbus helenae f. rufidula, commonly known as the red-leafed whitebeam, is a rare shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive red foliage, which contrasts with its white to pale green bark. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as pomes, which are typically red or orange in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
