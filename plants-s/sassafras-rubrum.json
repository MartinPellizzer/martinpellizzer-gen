    "intro": "Sassafras rubrum, commonly known as red sassafras, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often reddish in color when young, and its distinctive yellowish-orange flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Sassafras rubrum is also known for its aromatic properties, with its roots and leaves containing compounds used in traditional medicine. Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a common sight in woodland edges and disturbed areas."
