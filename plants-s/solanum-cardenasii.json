    "intro": "Solanum cardenasii, commonly known as the Candelabra nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its branched stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, and they contain toxic alkaloids. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species."
