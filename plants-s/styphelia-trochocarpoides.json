    "intro": "Styphelia trochocarpoides, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its coastal habitat. Styphelia trochocarpoides is well-suited to rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
