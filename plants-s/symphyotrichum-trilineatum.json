It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has a mat-forming growth habit. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have three distinct lobes, giving it its common name. It is an important nectar source for pollinators and is often used in native plant gardens."
