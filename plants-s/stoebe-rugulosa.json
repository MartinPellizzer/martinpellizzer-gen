It is a member of the Boraginaceae family, characterized by its hairy stems and blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a rough texture, and it produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.
