It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments within forests. The plant features slender, upright stems and produces small, delicate flowers with white to pale yellow petals. Its roots are often symbiotic with specific fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and threatened species in its native range."
