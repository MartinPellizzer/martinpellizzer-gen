    "intro": "Struthiopteris nodulosa, commonly known as the nodular shield fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant features a distinctive frond structure with a short, creeping rhizome and lanceolate, pinnate leaves. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Struthiopteris nodulosa is characterized by its nodular, shield-like appearance, which gives it its common name."
