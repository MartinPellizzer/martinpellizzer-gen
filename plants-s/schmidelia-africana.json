    "intro": "Schmidelia africana, commonly known as the African sandmat, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its umbel-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are finely divided and often have a silvery or grayish underside, which helps reduce water loss. Schmidelia africana is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
