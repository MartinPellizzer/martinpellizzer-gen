It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, branching fronds that resemble coral structures. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in dense forests or under dense canopies. Its leaves are thin and delicate, with a soft, velvety texture, and they often display a pale green to reddish hue. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems."
