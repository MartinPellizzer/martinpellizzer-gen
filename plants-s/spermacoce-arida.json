    "intro": "Spermacoce arida, commonly known as desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants. The plant is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a rough, hairy texture adapted to reduce water loss. Spermacoce arida is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to drought conditions."
