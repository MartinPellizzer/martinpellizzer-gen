    "intro": "Stapelia reflexa, commonly known as the twisted stem stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor similar to decaying meat, which attracts pollinators like flies. Stapelia reflexa is often cultivated for its unique appearance and adaptability to arid environments."
