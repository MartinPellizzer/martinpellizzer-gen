    "intro": "Stevia oxylaena, commonly known as the Mexican sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Central America and northern South America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and it is well-known for its intensely sweet taste, which comes from compounds similar to those found in other stevia species. Stevia oxylaena is often cultivated for its use in natural sweeteners and traditional medicine. Its leaves are typically used fresh or dried to add sweetness to foods and beverages without adding calories."
