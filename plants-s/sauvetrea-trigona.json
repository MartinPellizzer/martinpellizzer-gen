    "intro": "Sauvetrea trigona, commonly known as the three-lobed sauvetrea, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and evergreen foliage, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation. However, it is relatively rare in the wild and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive."
