    "intro": "Silene arbuscula, commonly known as the clustered catchfly, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. Silene arbuscula has hairy stems and leaves, and its seed pods split open to release tiny seeds. It is a short-lived perennial that plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
