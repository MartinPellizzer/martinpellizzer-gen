It consists of several species, most notably Sprengelia hypoleuca, which is native to South America. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. Its flowers are typically pink or purple and are arranged in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Sprengelia is often found in moist, shady environments and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
