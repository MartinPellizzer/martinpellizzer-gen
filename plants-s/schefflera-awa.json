    "intro": "Schefflera awa, commonly known as the Awa umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like crown of large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible for humans but toxic to some animals. Schefflera awa thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
