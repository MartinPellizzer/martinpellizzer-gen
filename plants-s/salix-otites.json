    "intro": "Salix otites, commonly known as the eastern silky willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and clusters of small, catkin-like flowers that appear in early spring. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a silvery underside, giving the plant its \"silky\" appearance. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near streams, wetlands, and riverbanks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
