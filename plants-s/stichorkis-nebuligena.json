    "intro": "Stichorkis nebuligena, commonly known as the nebula orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, colorful flower structure that resembles a nebula, with intricate patterns of purple, pink, and white. Native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces delicate, fragrant blooms during the spring season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
