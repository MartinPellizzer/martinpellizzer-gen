    "intro": "Solanum texanum, commonly known as the Texas nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its berries are initially green and turn red when mature, often mistaken for edible fruits, though they are toxic. Solanum texanum belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes."
