    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a compact, slow-growing shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a form of the common whitebeam, characterized by its smaller size and dense, rounded growth habit. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. Its fruit is a small, red, berry-like aggregate known as a \"sorbus,\" which ripens in late summer. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
