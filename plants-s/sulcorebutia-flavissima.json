    "intro": "Sulcorebutia flavissima, commonly known as the yellow sun rose, is a compact cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a ribbed structure and produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water. Its small, spiny leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. Sulcorebutia flavissima is popular among cactus enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
