It features small, white flowers with five petals arranged in a star shape, giving it its common name. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
