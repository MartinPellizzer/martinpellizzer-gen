It features fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, vibrant red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it store water, adapting it to dry environments. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking color and drought tolerance."
