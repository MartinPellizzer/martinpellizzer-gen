    "intro": "Sobralia antioquiensis, commonly known as the Antioquian sobralia, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually brightly colored, ranging from yellow to orange, and are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss, Sobralia antioquiensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
