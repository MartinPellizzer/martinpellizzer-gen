    "intro": "Selaginella pensilis, commonly known as the hanging clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping rhizome with erect, spirally arranged leaves that are usually linear and pointed. Selaginella pensilis reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
