    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 rubens f. sanguinea, commonly known as the blood willow, is a hybrid willow species native to the northern regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive red-brown bark and bright red to orange twigs, which are particularly striking in winter. The plant typically grows along riverbanks and moist soils, exhibiting a shrub-like form with slender, drooping branches. Its leaves are oval-shaped, with a smooth margin and a slightly serrated edge, and they turn a vibrant yellow in the autumn. This ornamental willow is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its visual interest throughout the year."
