    "intro": "Stipa macounii, commonly known as Macoun's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and produces airy, feathery seed heads that are often a striking silver or white color. The plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. Its growth habit is clump-forming, with tall, upright stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. Stipa macounii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
