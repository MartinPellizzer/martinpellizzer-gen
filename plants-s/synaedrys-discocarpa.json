    "intro": "Synaedrys discocarpa, commonly known as the red-flowered rock orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and its striking red and purple flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its arid habitat. Synaedrys discocarpa is a protected species due to habitat loss and over-collection."
