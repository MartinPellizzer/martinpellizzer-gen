    "intro": "Selaginella caffrorum, commonly known as the African clubmoss, is a member of the spikemoss family (Lycopodiaceae). It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its whorled arrangement of needle-like leaves and a short, thick stem. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Selaginella caffrorum is often found in southern Africa and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance."
