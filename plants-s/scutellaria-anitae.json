It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which bloom during the summer months. Scutellaria anitae is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though scientific research on its properties remains limited."
