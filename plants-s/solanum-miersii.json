    "intro": "Solanum miersii, commonly known as the Miers's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with hairy stems and oval-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually yellow or white, and it produces small, rounded berries that contain toxic alkaloids. Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
