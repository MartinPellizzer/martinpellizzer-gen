It features dense clusters of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically green with red or pinkish hues, especially in cooler temperatures. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and sunny environments, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun. This variety is popular in rock gardens and as a houseplant due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
