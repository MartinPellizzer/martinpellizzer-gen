    "intro": "Senecio hercynicus subsp. durmitorensis, commonly known as the Durmitor senecio, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Durmitor Mountains in Montenegro. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, exhibiting a low-growing, cushion-like form to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are usually gray-green, covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and human activity."
