    "intro": "Saussurea nyalamensis, commonly known as the Nyalam saffron, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and India. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and dense inflorescence of yellow flowers. The plant thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its flowers are rich in saffron-like stigmas, which have been traditionally used in local medicine and as a spice. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
