    "intro": "Serapias orientalis subsp. dafnii, commonly known as the Daffodil Orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and vibrant yellow flowers with a distinctive hooded lip. Native to the mountainous regions of Turkey, this subspecies thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant's morphology reflects its adaptation to harsh alpine environments, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
