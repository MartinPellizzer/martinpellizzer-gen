    "intro": "Samyda piscidia, commonly known as the fish poison tree, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often arranged in an odd-pinnate pattern. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is known for its toxic properties. The sap and leaves contain compounds that can be used as a fish poison, which is why it has earned its common name."
