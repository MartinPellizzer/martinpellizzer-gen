    "intro": "Sorbus umbellata var. graeca, commonly known as the Greek whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Balkans and parts of southern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its white to pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters during late spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red or orange in color, which are consumed by various bird species. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in autumn. The bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and the plant is often found in dry, rocky habitats."
