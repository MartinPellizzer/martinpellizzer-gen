    "intro": "Specklinia pemonum, commonly known as the Pemon staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to several feet in diameter. The plant typically attaches itself to trees or rocks, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to flourish."
