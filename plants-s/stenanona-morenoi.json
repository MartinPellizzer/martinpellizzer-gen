    "intro": "Stenanona morenoi, commonly known as the Moreno's stenanona, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers range in color from white to pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stenanona morenoi is considered a vulnerable species."
