    "intro": "Sorbus reducta var. reducta, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, red or orange berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
