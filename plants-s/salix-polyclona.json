    "intro": "Salix polyclona, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine white or grey pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Salix polyclona is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
