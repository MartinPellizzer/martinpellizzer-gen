    "intro": "Scirpus lanifer, commonly known as the woolly bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silky white hair, giving it its common name. Its flowering spikes are cylindrical and produce small, greenish-brown flowers that are wind-pollinated. Scirpus lanifer plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
