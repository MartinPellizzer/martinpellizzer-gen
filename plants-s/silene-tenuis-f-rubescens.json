    "intro": "Silene tenuis f. rubescens, commonly known as the pink-stemmed bladder campion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, reddish stems that become more pronounced as the plant matures. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. This variety is distinguished by its distinctive reddish coloration of the stems, which sets it apart from the typical green-stemmed form of Silene tenuis."
