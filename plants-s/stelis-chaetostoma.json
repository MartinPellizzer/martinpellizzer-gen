    "intro": "Stelis chaetostoma, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that often display a range of colors from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis chaetostoma is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
