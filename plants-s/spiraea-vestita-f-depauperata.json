    "intro": "Spiraea vestita f. depauperata, commonly known as the sparse-flowered weeping spiraea, is a compact, deciduous shrub characterized by its slender, arching branches that give it a weeping appearance. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves that provide a striking contrast to its floral display. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. Due to its delicate form and seasonal blooms, it is well-suited for smaller spaces and can be used as a specimen plant or in rock gardens."
