    "intro": "Spiranthes goninensis, commonly known as the pink spire orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, spiral-shaped inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with three sepals and three petals, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Spiranthes goninensis is often found in sandy or clay soils and is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
