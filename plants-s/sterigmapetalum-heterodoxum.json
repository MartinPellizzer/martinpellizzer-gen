It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped petals that exhibit a distinctive asymmetrical pattern. The plant typically grows in tropical regions, thriving in humid and shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often with a waxy coating that aids in water retention. Botanically, it is notable for its unusual floral structure, which has led to ongoing taxonomic debate among plant scientists."
