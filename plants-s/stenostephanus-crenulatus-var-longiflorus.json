    "intro": "Stenostephanus crenulatus var. longiflorus, commonly known as the long-flowered stephanus, is a unique variant of the stephanus plant native to specific regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its elongated, showy flowers that bloom in clusters, often displaying shades of pink and white. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its distinctive floral display."
