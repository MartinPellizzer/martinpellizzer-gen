    "intro": "Schoenus lepidosperma subsp. pachylepis, commonly known as the slender spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. The species is adapted to fluctuating water levels and is often found in areas with poor drainage."
