    "intro": "Salsola depressa, commonly known as dwarf Russian thistle, is a low-growing, perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in areas with minimal water availability. Salsola depressa is also known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it a common weed in agricultural and roadside settings."
