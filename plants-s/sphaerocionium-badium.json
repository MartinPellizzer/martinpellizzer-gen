    "intro": "Sphaerocionium badium, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, glossy dark green leaves, and small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round, red fruits that contain a single seed. It is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and as a source of essential oils. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
