    "intro": "Sesleria calcarea var. aristata, commonly known as the aristate rock thrift, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial belonging to the grass family (Poaceae). It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flower spikes in early summer, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or alpine environments. This variety is notable for its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
