It belongs to the family Apiaceae, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant is distinguished by its small, compact growth habit and pale yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it adapted to harsh desert environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
