It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other mustard plants. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated pods containing seeds. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
