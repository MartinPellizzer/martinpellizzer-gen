    "intro": "Sagittaria edulis, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a flowering aquatic plant native to the Americas. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant has arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor in the substrate. It produces small white flowers that bloom above the water, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Sagittaria edulis is also valued for its edible tubers, which have been traditionally consumed by various indigenous communities."
