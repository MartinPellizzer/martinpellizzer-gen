    "intro": "Salacia arenicola, commonly known as the sand orchid, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Australia. It is a perennial herb with slender, wiry stems and small, linear leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or inland deserts. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, Salacia arenicola is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
