    "intro": "Scilla maesta, commonly known as the noble squill, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to April. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette of bulbs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Scilla maesta is also valued for its ability to naturalize and return year after year."
