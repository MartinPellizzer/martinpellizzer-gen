    "intro": "Sphaeralcea parryi, commonly known as Parry's globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its globular, yellow flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has hairy, glandular stems and leaves that help reduce water loss. Sphaeralcea parryi is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
