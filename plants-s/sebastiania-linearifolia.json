    "intro": "Sebastiania linearifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf sebastiania, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries, which are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or limestone areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
