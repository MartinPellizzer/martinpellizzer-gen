    "intro": "Sonchus oleraceus var. angustifolius, commonly known as narrowleaf sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly bitter taste. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, followed by spiny, spherical fruits. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many regions."
