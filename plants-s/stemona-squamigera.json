It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture. Stemona squamigera is valued in traditional medicine for its potential pharmacological properties."
