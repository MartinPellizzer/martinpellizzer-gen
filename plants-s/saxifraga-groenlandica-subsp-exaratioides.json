    "intro": "Saxifraga groenlandica subsp. exaratioides, commonly known as the Greenland saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It features compact rosettes of dark green, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in tundra ecosystems."
