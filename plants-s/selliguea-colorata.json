    "intro": "Selliguea colorata, commonly known as the red moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and bright red to orange-brown coloration, which is particularly striking when dry. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rocky surfaces or in forest floors. Its leaves are small, ovate, and have a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Selliguea colorata is widely distributed across temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
