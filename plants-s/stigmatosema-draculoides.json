    "intro": "Stigmatosema draculoides, commonly known as the dragon's blood tree, is a unique plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped canopy and thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces a red, resinous sap that has been historically valued for its medicinal and preservative properties. Its growth habit and appearance resemble that of a tree, despite being a shrub-like species. Stigmatosema draculoides is native to parts of Africa and is adapted to survive in dry, rocky habitats."
