    "intro": "Senecio hemsleyi, commonly known as the Hemsley's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, providing a distinctive appearance. Senecio hemsleyi is adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
