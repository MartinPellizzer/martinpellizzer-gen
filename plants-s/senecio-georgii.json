    "intro": "Senecio georgii, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy, gray-green foliage. The plant typically grows in arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Senecio georgii produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which aid in its propagation across dry landscapes. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
