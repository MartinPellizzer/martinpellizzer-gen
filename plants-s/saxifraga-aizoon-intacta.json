    "intro": "Saxifraga aizoon intacta, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, lobed leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
