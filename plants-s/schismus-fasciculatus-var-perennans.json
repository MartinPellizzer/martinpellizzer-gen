    "intro": "Schismus fasciculatus var. perennans, commonly known as the annual sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that produces small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. It is often found in disturbed areas and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects in dry environments."
