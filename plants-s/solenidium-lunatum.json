    "intro": "Solenidium lunatum, commonly known as the moonlight spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, lantern-like inflorescences that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant has smooth, waxy leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests. Due to its unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
