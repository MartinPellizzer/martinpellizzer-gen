    "intro": "Styrax platanifolius var. youngiae, commonly known as the Chinese frankincense tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by fragrant, resinous capsules that release a sticky, aromatic substance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine and incense production. Its growth habit and unique chemical compounds make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
