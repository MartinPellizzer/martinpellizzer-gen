    "intro": "Solanum insidiosum var. armatissimum, commonly known as the armed nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and leaves, which provide a defensive mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, violet flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its berries are toxic and contain alkaloids, making it a plant of caution in both horticulture and natural environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
