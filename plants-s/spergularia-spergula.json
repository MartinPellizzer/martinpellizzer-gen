    "intro": "Spergularia spergula, commonly known as sea sandwort, is a small flowering plant that thrives in coastal and saline environments. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with tiny, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in the summer months. It is well adapted to salt spray and sandy soils, making it a common species in dune ecosystems. Spergularia spergula plays a role in stabilizing coastal sands and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
