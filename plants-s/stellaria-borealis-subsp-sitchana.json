    "intro": "Stellaria borealis subsp. sitchana, commonly known as the Arctic starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically features small, star-shaped white flowers and narrow, linear leaves adapted to cold climates. The plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its flowering period occurs during the short summer season, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat. Stellaria borealis subsp. sitchana is an important component of Arctic plant communities, contributing to biodiversity in extreme environments."
