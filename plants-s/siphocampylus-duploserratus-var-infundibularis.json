    "intro": "Siphocampylus duploserratus var. infundibularis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed siphocampylus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its growth habit is typically upright, with a compact form that makes it suitable for rock gardens or container cultivation. The variety infundibularis is distinguished by its narrower leaves and more elongated inflorescences compared to the typical form."
