    "intro": "Scabiosa ovatifolia, commonly known as the heart's-ease or round-leaved scabious, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are ovate and often have a velvety texture, which contributes to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and rock gardens. This plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
