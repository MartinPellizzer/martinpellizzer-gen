    "intro": "Schoenoplectus oligosetus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense colonies in marshes and pond edges. Schoenoplectus oligosetus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
