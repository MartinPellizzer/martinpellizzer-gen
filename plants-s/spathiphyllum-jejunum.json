It is characterized by its upright, narrow leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white, spatulate flowers that are enclosed within a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, fertile soil. Spathiphyllum jejunum is valued for its ornamental appeal and air-purifying qualities."
