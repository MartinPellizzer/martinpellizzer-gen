    "intro": "Saxifraga globulifera f. villigremma, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America. It features dense clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. This variety is noted for its compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in alpine settings."
