    "intro": "Sclerocarya birrea, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and produces large, yellowish-green fruits that contain a high oil content. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in poor soils. Its fruit is widely used for oil extraction, which is essential in the production of cosmetics and food products. The tree also plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
