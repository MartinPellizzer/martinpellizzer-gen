    "intro": "Stipa platychaeta, commonly known as the broad-leaved needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open woodlands, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spikelet that produces small, spike-like flowers. Stipa platychaeta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
