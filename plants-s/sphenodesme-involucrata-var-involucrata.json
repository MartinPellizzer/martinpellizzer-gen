    "intro": "Sphenodesme involucrata var. involucrata, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its roots are deep and adapted to access groundwater, making it drought-tolerant. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in grassland and shrubland ecosystems."
