    "intro": "Salix trautvetteriana, commonly known as Trautvetter's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian habitats. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
