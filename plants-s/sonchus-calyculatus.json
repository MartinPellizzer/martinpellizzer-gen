    "intro": "Sonchus calyculatus, commonly known as the small-flowered sowthistle, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant has alternate, hairy leaves that are usually lance-shaped with a serrated margin. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a composite head, and it produces achene seeds with pappus for wind dispersal. It is often considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
