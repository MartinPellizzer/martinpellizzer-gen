    "intro": "Salix hastata f. tenuifolia-angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a shrub native to North America, particularly found in moist, often swampy areas. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its growth habit is often sprawling or semi-woody, with multiple stems arising from a single base. This variety is notable for its adaptability to wet environments and its role in stabilizing riverbanks and wetlands."
