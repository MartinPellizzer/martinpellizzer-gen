    "intro": "Senna obovata, commonly known as the golden senna, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are composed of numerous small, obovate leaflets. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Senna obovata is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of dye due to its chemical compounds."
