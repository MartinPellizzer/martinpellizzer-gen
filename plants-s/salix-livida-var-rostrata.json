    "intro": "Salix livida var. rostrata, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow or rostrated willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery hair. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are important for pollination by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in alpine meadows. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
