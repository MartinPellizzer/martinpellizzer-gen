    "intro": "Stellaria pubera subsp. typica, commonly known as hairy starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often hairy as well, contributing to its overall texture. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
