    "intro": "Stelis soratana, commonly known as the white-stemmed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a slender, wiry stem with a single or few leaves, and its flowers are small, white, and fragrant. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic or lithophytic growth habit. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
