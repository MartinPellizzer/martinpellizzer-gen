    "intro": "Senecio jurgensenii, commonly known as the Jurgensen's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and desert scrublands. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer, followed by small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
