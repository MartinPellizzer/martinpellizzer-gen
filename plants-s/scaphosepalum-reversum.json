    "intro": "Scaphosepalum reversum, commonly known as the reverse-sheath orchid, is a rare and unusual orchid species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, with petals that curve backward, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually small and pale in color, with a distinct scent that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Scaphosepalum reversum is considered a vulnerable species."
