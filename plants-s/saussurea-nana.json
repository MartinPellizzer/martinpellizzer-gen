    "intro": "Saussurea nana, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically reaches heights of only a few centimeters, with a dense rosette of basal leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in unstable terrain and absorb nutrients from the thin soil. Saussurea nana is an important component of alpine ecosystems, providing food for various insects and small mammals."
