    "intro": "Sonchus glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and basal rosettes of spoon-shaped, lobed leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often becoming a weed in agricultural settings. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it both ecologically significant and agriculturally problematic."
