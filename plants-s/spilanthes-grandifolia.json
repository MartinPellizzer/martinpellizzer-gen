    "intro": "Spilanthes grandifolia, commonly known as the Mexican buttercup, is a herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense inflorescence. The plant is known for its strong, pungent odor, which is often described as similar to that of a garlic or mustard plant. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. Spilanthes grandifolia is also valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional herbal practices."
