    "intro": "Scirpus inclinatus, commonly known as the leaning bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often lean or bow, giving it its common name. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Scirpus inclinatus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
