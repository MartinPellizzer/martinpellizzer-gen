    "intro": "Seseli provostii, commonly known as Provost's sesame, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts upon maturity. Seseli provostii is adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments, often growing in rocky soils and open habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in desert ecosystems."
