    "intro": "Scirpus ovatus, commonly known as the broad-leaf bulrush, is a tall, perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its stiff, triangular stems and broad, grass-like leaves that are often ribbed and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical spikes, typically blooming in late summer. Scirpus ovatus thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important species in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its dense growth helps stabilize soil and provides habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
