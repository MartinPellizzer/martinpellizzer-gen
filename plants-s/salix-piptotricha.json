    "intro": "Salix piptotricha, commonly known as the Chinese weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to China and neighboring regions. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically pale green underneath. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. Its bark is smooth and gray, often exfoliating to reveal a lighter inner layer. Salix piptotricha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in parks and gardens for its graceful appearance."
