It is characterized by its smooth, light green bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
