    "intro": "Saxifraga vayredana var. intermedia, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are arranged in a raceme. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
