    "intro": "Sulcorebutia zavaletae, commonly known as the Zavaleta's crevice cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is a compact, low-growing cactus with a short, thick stem that often remains hidden beneath a layer of soil. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to dry conditions. Sulcorebutia zavaletae is prized by collectors for its unique appearance and resilience in harsh environments."
