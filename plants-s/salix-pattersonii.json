    "intro": "Salix pattersonii, commonly known as the Paterson's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and its distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in streamside habitats. Salix pattersonii is notable for its role in stabilizing riverbanks and its ecological importance to native wildlife."
