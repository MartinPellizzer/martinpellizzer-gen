    "intro": "Stisseria jacquiniana, commonly known as the Jacquin's stisseria, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, while its small white or greenish flowers bloom in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its family."
