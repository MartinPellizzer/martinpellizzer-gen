    "intro": "Sphenogyne heterodonta, commonly known as the double-lobed fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive fronds. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features intricate, finely divided leaves that are often covered in a thin layer of moisture-retaining mucus. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the undersides of the fronds. The botanical study of Sphenogyne heterodonta provides insights into the evolution and adaptation of ferns in humid environments."
