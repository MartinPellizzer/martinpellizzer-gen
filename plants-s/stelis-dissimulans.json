It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant typically produces a single, upright stem with a few leaves and a raceme of small, fragrant flowers. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow with intricate patterns, and it blooms during the rainy season. Stelis dissimulans is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
