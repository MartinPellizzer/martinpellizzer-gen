    "intro": "Scambopus curvipes, commonly known as the curved-stem scambopus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its distinctive feature is its curved, hollow stems that are often used in traditional medicine. Scambopus curvipes plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune habitats and providing shelter for small coastal fauna."
