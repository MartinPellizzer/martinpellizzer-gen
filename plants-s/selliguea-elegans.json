    "intro": "Selliguea elegans, commonly known as the elegant moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branching structure and small, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, cushion-like form. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in forest floors. Selliguea elegans has a complex thalloid structure with distinct dorsal and ventral surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including archegonia and antheridia, are located on the lower surface of the thallus, typical of its liverwort classification."
