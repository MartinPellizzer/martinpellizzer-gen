    "intro": "Silene vulgaris subsp. cratericola, commonly known as the mountain catchfly, is a flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Silene vulgaris subsp. cratericola is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and providing habitat for various insect species."
