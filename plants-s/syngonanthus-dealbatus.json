    "intro": "Syngonanthus dealbatus, commonly known as the white-flowered grassvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous traits and ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense tufts with slender, hairy stems. Its small, white to pale pink flowers are arranged in racemes, and it produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds. Syngonanthus dealbatus is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and contribution to soil fertility."
