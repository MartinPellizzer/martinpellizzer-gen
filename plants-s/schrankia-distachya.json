    "intro": "Schrankia distachya, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, fleshy leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters. The plant is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or coastal environments. It has a creeping root system that allows it to spread and colonize open areas effectively. Schrankia distachya is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
