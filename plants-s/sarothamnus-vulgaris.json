    "intro": "Sarothamnus vulgaris, commonly known as the common thimbleweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils, often in Mediterranean climates. The plant features small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Sarothamnus vulgaris is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
