    "intro": "Saxifraga umbrosa var. typica, commonly known as the shade saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and features small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to white flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on slender, erect stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Saxifraga umbrosa var. typica is well adapted to rocky or shaded soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
