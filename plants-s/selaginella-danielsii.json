    "intro": "Selaginella danielsii, commonly known as the African spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves and the presence of spore-bearing structures called strobila. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Selaginella danielsii is known for its ability to survive in arid conditions due to its specialized water retention mechanisms. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
