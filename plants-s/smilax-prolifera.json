    "intro": "Smilax prolifera, commonly known as the creeping smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It features a robust, woody stem that grows horizontally along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikelike inflorescences, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a distinctive waxy coating. Smilax prolifera is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
