    "intro": "Senegalia limae, commonly known as the lima acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Its root system helps prevent soil erosion, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Senegalia limae plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
