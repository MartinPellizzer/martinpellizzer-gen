    "intro": "Sclerocactus parviflorus var. intermedius, commonly known as the Intermediate small-flowered sclerocactus, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hair. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. This variety is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
