    "intro": "Spergularia halophila, commonly known as salt marsh grass or sea sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as salt marshes and coastal areas. The plant has small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, and its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Spergularia halophila is adapted to tolerate high salinity and fluctuating water levels, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for other organisms highlights its ecological significance in saltwater environments."
