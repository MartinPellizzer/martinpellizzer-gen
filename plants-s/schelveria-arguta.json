    "intro": "Schelveria arguta, commonly known as the smooth sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Schelveria arguta thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dune environments. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor habitats."
