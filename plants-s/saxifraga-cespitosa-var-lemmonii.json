    "intro": "Saxifraga cespitosa var. lemmonii, commonly known as the Lemmon's saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or grayish pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, branching stalks. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
