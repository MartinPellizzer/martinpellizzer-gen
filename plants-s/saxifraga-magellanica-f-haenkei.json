    "intro": "Saxifraga magellanica f. haenkei, commonly known as the Magellan saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southern regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps to protect it from harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine collections."
