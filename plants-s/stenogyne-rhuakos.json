    "intro": "Stenogyne rhuakos, commonly known as the Kauai mountain mint, is a perennial herb native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and showy blue-violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky areas. Its small, clustered inflorescences attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stenogyne rhuakos is considered a rare and endangered species."
