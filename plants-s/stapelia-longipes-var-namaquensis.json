It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces unique, waxy, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which emit a strong odor resembling decaying meat. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for xeriscaping. This variety is prized for its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
