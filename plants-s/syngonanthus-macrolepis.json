It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green flowers. Syngonanthus macrolepis is often found in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands, where it thrives in humid, well-drained environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
