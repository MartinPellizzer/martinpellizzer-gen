    "intro": "Strongylodon ruber, commonly known as the red ant plant, is a unique species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking red flowers and its ability to produce a sticky, resinous substance that attracts ants. The plant's botanical structure includes a short, thick stem and broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid environment. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and the plant is known for its symbiotic relationship with ants. Strongylodon ruber is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological significance in its native habitat."
