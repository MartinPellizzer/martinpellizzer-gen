    "intro": "Solanum amblymerum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and elliptical, often hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its succulent stems and reduced leaf surface. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though with caution due to their potent chemical composition."
