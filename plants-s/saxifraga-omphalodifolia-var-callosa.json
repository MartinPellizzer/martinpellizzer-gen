    "intro": "Saxifraga omphalodifolia var. callosa, commonly known as the woolly saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, woolly leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in early summer, typically arranged in a cluster at the center of the rosette. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
