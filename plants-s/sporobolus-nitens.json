    "intro": "Sporobolus nitens, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact, spikelike inflorescences that produce small, white to pale blue flowers. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small animals and insects. Sporobolus nitens is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance."
