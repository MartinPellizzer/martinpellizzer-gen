    "intro": "Stevia coriacea, commonly known as the rough stevia, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its serrated, lance-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is known for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its leaves are often used in herbal teas and as a natural sweetener alternative."
