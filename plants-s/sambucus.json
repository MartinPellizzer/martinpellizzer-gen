It consists of over 100 species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, clusters of small white or yellow flowers, and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer or early autumn. Sambucus species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and the edible berries used in culinary and medicinal applications. The berries contain high levels of antioxidants and are used in jams, wines, and traditional remedies."
