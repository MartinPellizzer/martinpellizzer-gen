    "intro": "Streptopus streptopoides var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed star-nut, is a rare and unique plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle floral element to its appearance. Its stems are typically shorter and more compact compared to other varieties in the genus, contributing to its common name. This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features."
