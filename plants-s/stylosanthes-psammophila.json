    "intro": "Stylosanthes psammophila, commonly known as the sand stylo, is a leguminous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and Australia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy soils and is highly drought-tolerant. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pod-like fruits containing elliptical seeds. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in degraded lands. Stylosanthes psammophila is also used as forage for livestock and in land rehabilitation projects."
