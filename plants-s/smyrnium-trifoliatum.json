    "intro": "Smyrnium trifoliatum, commonly known as the three-leaved hogweed, is a biennial or perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features tall, hollow stems that are often reddish-purple in color, and its leaves are large, deeply lobed, and trifoliate, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, which bloom in the summer. It is known for its strong, unpleasant odor and can be toxic if ingested. The plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in meadows."
