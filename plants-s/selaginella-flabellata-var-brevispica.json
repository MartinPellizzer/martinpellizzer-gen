    "intro": "Selaginella flabellata var. brevispica, commonly known as the short-bracted clubmoss, is a low-growing, evergreen plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, spore-bearing strobila that is typically shorter than the leaves. The plant has whorled leaves that are often linear to lanceolate in shape, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, mat-like growth. Its reproductive structures are essential for its propagation and ecological role in forest understories."
