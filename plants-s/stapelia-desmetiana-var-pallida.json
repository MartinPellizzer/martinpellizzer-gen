    "intro": "Stapelia desmetiana var. pallida, commonly known as the pale stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and distinctive, waxy flowers that resemble dead animals, a feature that aids in attracting pollinators. The plant produces pale yellow to white blooms with a strong, unpleasant odor, which is typical of many stapelia species. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight to flourish. This variety is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts."
