    "intro": "Scariola orientalis subsp. nuristanica, commonly known as the Nuristan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Afghanistan and northern Pakistan. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high altitudes, often reaching elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered with fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
