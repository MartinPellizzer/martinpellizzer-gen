    "intro": "Sesleria dura, commonly known as the hardy tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sesleria dura is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, low-maintenance ground cover."
