    "intro": "Sturmia kappleri, commonly known as the kappler's sturmia, is a unique and rare plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that resemble a hand, with a deep green color and a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, which bloom in early summer. Sturmia kappleri is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and requires well-drained, rocky soil to thrive. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
