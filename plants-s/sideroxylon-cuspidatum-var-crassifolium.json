    "intro": "Sideroxylon cuspidatum var. crassifolium, commonly known as the thick-leaved ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, leathery leaves that are often arranged in opposite pairs. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody fruits containing small seeds. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
