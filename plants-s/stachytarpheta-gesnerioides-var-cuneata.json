    "intro": "Stachytarpheta gesnerioides var. cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironweed, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom from late summer into early autumn. These flowers are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is well-suited for moist, well-drained soils."
