    "intro": "Saxifraga granulata var. duplicata, commonly known as the double-stemmed saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features compact, rosette-forming foliage with thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, granular texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white or pink, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
