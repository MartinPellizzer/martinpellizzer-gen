    "intro": "Sagraea munchicana, commonly known as the Munchican sagraea, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to orange. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Sagraea munchicana is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
