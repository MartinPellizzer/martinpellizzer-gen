    "intro": "Salsola ruthenica, commonly known as Russian thornweed, is a perennial shrub native to the steppes and semi-desert regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, bead-like fruits. It is adapted to thrive in saline and alkaline soils, making it a common species in disturbed or degraded landscapes. Salsola ruthenica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in certain regions."
