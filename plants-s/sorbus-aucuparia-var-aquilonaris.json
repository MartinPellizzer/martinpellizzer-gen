It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and often have serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red or orange berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Its fruiting bodies are edible for humans but can be toxic in large quantities. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
