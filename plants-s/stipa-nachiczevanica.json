    "intro": "Stipa nachiczevanica, commonly known as the Armenian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is characterized by its slender, erect culms and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Stipa nachiczevanica is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
