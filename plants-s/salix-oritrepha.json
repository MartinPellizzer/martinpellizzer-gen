    "intro": "Salix oritrepha, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by narrow, elongated fruits. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows, and is often used in ecological restoration projects. The species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
