    "intro": "Salix hastatella subsp. picoeuropeana, commonly known as the European weeping willow, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver on the underside. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination and seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and ponds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appearance and its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
