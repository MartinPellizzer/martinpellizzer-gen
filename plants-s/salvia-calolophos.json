    "intro": "Salvia calolophos, commonly known as the California sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, silvery-gray foliage and showy purple to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its leaves contain essential oils that contribute to its strong scent and have been used traditionally by Native American tribes. Salvia calolophos plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native habitat."
