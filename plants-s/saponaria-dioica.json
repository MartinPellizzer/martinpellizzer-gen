    "intro": "Saponaria dioica, commonly known as the pink soapwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has basal leaves that are rounded and hairy, and its stems are often covered in fine, white hairs. Saponaria dioica is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, known for its milky sap, which can produce a soapy lather when crushed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas."
