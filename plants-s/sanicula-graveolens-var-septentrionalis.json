    "intro": "Sanicula graveolens var. septentrionalis, commonly known as northern hogweed, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It features a tall, hollow stem that is often reddish-purple in color, with a distinctive, umbrella-like inflorescence composed of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has large, palmately lobed leaves that are hairy and emit a strong, unpleasant odor when crushed. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and streambanks. The species is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
