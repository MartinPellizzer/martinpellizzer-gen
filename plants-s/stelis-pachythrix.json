    "intro": "Stelis pachythrix, commonly known as the thick-stemmed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive, intricate structure. Its stems are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Stelis pachythrix thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
