    "intro": "Spathia neurosa, commonly known as the slender spikeplant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, erect stems that bear whorled, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers arranged in spike-like inflorescences. Its root system is fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Spathia neurosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
