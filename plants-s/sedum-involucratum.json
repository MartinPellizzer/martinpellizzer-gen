    "intro": "Sedum involucratum, commonly known as the woolly stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum involucratum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh weather conditions."
