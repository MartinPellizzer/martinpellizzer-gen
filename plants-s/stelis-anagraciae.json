    "intro": "Stelis anagraciae, commonly known as the white-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of forests. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The orchid's unique floral structure and coloration make it a striking addition to botanical gardens and a subject of interest for horticulturists."
