    "intro": "Sclerophylax hunzikeri, commonly known as the Hunziker's sclerophyll, is a rare and specialized plant species native to high-altitude environments. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid or semi-arid conditions. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with a distinctive coloration that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, Sclerophylax hunzikeri is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
