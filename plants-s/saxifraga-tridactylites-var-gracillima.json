It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in harsh environments with low temperatures and strong winds. The plant features small, clustered leaves that are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in late summer. It is well adapted to cold climates and has a low-growing habit to protect itself from extreme weather conditions."
