    "intro": "Stipa nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It thrives in high-elevation environments, typically found in mountain meadows and open slopes. The plant is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences composed of small, bristle-like flowers. Its foliage is generally gray-green, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Stipa nevadensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
