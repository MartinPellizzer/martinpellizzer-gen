    "intro": "Saxifraga oresbia, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh alpine environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming in late summer. Saxifraga oresbia thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
