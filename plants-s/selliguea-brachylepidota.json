    "intro": "Selliguea brachylepidota, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wall moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and small, linear leaves that are often curved. The leaves are typically reddish-brown when dry and turn green when moist, which is a common trait in many mosses. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, including capsules, are borne on short, erect stems and release spores when mature."
