    "intro": "Solanum vansittartense, commonly known as the Van Stittart's nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru, where it grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by edible berries that are often consumed by local communities. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, and it has a long flowering period that extends into the dry season. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
