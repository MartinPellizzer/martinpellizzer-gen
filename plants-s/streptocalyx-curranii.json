    "intro": "Streptocalyx curranii, commonly known as the Curran's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Eucalyptus. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy berries. This species is native to southeastern Australia and is often found in dry, open habitats."
