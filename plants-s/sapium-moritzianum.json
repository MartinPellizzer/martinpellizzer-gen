    "intro": "Sapium moritzianum, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, pinnately compound leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing sticky, oily seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and rapid growth. However, it is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its ability to outcompete native flora."
