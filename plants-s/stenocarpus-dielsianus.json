    "intro": "Stenocarpus dielsianus, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to the wet tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 2 to 4 meters and has glossy, dark green, leathery leaves that are alternate and elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. Its botanical features make it an important component of the rainforest understory, contributing to biodiversity and ecological balance."
