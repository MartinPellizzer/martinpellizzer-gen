It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. The plant features small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer.
