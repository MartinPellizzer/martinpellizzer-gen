    "intro": "Sudamerlycaste ariasii, commonly known as the Brazilian moonflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the rainforests of Brazil. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, tropical habitat. It produces small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Due to its limited distribution and unique flowering behavior, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study."
