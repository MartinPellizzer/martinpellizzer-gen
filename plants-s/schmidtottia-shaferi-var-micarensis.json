    "intro": "Schmidtottia shaferi var. micarensis, commonly known as the Micarense Schmidtottia, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions in Central America. It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its distinctive, often ornamental foliage. The plant typically exhibits a slender trunk with a crown of elongated, feather-like leaves that can reach several feet in length. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
