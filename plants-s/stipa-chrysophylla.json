    "intro": "Stipa chrysophylla, commonly known as golden feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, feathery plumes that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to cold and arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more golden in color during the flowering season. Stipa chrysophylla is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature."
