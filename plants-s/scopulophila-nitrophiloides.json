    "intro": "Scopulophila nitrophiloides, commonly known as the nitrophilous rock orchid, is a rare and specialized plant that thrives in nutrient-rich, calcareous soils. It is typically found in rocky or limestone habitats, where it forms a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi. The plant has a compact, low-growing structure with small, delicate leaves and inconspicuous flowers that are often pale green or yellowish in color. It is adapted to low-light conditions and requires a stable, moist environment to survive. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
