    "intro": "Stipa chubutensis var. hirsutissima, commonly known as the Hirsute Needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Patagonian region of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender culms and dense, hairy inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in grasslands and rocky soils. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it ecologically significant in its native habitat. The variety is distinguished by its particularly dense and coarse pubescence, which sets it apart from other Stipa species."
