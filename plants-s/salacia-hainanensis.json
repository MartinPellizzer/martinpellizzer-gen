    "intro": "Salacia hainanensis, commonly known as Hainan salacia, is a flowering plant species native to the island of Hainan in China. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its woody stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkin-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
