It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as swampy areas and along riverbanks. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are arranged in inflorescences at the tips of the stems. Scleria remota is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist environments."
