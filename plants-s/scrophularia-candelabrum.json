    "intro": "Scrophularia candelabrum, commonly known as the candlestick scrophularia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems that resemble a candlestick, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular, two-lipped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Scrophularia candelabrum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
