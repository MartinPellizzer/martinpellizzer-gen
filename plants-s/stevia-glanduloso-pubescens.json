    "intro": "Stevia glanduloso-pubescens, commonly known as the hairy leaf stevia, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a perennial herb characterized by its lance-shaped leaves covered in fine hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Stevia glanduloso-pubescens is known for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, making it a natural sweetener. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant in both traditional medicine and modern health applications."
