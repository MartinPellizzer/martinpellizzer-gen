    "intro": "Santalodes humile, commonly known as the dwarf sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Santalaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic, woody stems. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous. Santalodes humile is valued for its fragrant wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a component in perfumes."
