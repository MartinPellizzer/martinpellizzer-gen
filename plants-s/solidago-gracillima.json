    "intro": "Solidago gracillima, commonly known as slender goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along streambanks. It blooms from late summer into early autumn, producing copious amounts of nectar that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Solidago gracillima is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity and its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
