    "intro": "Sedum hispanicum var. planifolium, commonly known as the flat-leaved stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature allows it to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
