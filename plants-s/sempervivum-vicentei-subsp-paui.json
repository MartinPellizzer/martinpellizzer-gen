It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in harsh conditions, contributing to its resilience in Mediterranean climates."
