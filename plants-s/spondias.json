    "intro": "Spondias, commonly known as the \"cottonwood\" or \"wild mango,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Anacardiaceae. These trees are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, Africa, and Southeast Asia. They are characterized by their smooth, often greyish bark and compound leaves with leaflets that are usually opposite or alternate. Spondias species produce small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by edible, fibrous fruits resembling small mangoes. The genus includes several species, such as Spondias mombinii and Spondias purpurea, which are valued for their ornamental and edible qualities."
