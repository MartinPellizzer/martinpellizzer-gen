It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces smooth, spherical berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
