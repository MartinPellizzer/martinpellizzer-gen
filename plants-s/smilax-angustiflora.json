    "intro": "Smilax angustiflora, commonly known as narrowleaf greenbriar, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It features woody stems that are covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and typically have a narrow, elliptical shape with a serrated margin. Smilax angustiflora thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland understories."
