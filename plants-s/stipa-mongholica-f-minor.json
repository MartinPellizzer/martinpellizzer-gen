    "intro": "Stipa mongholica f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf feathergrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Asia. It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, forming dense, mat-like clumps that are well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces slender, wiry stems covered in fine, silky hairs, and its inflorescence consists of narrow, spike-like clusters of tiny flowers. It is often found in open, sunny habitats such as steppes, meadows, and rocky areas. Due to its compact form and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its delicate, grass-like appearance."
