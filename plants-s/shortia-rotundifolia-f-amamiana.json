    "intro": "Shortia rotundifolia f. amamiana, commonly known as the Amami dwarf bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant found primarily on the islands of Amami \u014cshima and Tokunoshima in Japan. It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial with small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it forms dense mats. Its leaves are rounded and glossy, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
