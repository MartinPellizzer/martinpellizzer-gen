    "intro": "Sclerochloa zwierleinii, commonly known as the dwarf needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
