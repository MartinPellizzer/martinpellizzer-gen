    "intro": "Salix koriyanagi, commonly known as Japanese weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that give it a graceful, weeping appearance. The leaves are elongated, thin, and have a silvery underside, contributing to its ornamental value. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by narrow, elongated fruits. This species is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
