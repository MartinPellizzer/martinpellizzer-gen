    "intro": "Stegolepis perligulata, commonly known as the small-leaved rock heath, is a flowering plant native to the southern regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form. The plant features small, leathery leaves and produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
