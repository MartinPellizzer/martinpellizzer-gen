    "intro": "Sericostachys tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly lespedeza, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a creeping growth habit and produces small, three-lobed seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Sericostachys tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone regions."
