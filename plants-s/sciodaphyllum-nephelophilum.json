    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum nephelophilum, commonly known as the cloud forest fern, is a rare and unique plant species native to high-altitude cloud forests. It exhibits specialized adaptations to thrive in the humid, misty environments where sunlight is limited. Its fronds are broad and leathery, allowing it to retain moisture and withstand frequent rainfall. The plant's reproductive structures are hidden within its dense foliage, making it challenging to study in the wild. Due to habitat loss, Sciodaphyllum nephelophilum is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native ecosystems."
