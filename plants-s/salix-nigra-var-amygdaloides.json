    "intro": "Salix nigra var. amygdaloides, commonly known as the black willow with almond-like buds, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and dark, fissured bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are oval-shaped, with a serrated margin and a glossy green upper surface. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that mature into woody capsules. This species is often found in moist soils near streams and in wetland habitats."
