    "intro": "Styrax japonicus, commonly known as Japanese storax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan and Korea. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape and have a glossy dark green upper surface. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. Its bark is thick, flaky, and has a distinctive aromatic scent, which is the source of its common name. Styrax japonicus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine for its therapeutic properties."
