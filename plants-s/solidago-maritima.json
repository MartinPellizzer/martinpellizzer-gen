    "intro": "Solidago maritima, commonly known as sea goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America. It thrives in salty, sandy soils and is often found in dunes and tidal zones. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a robust root system that helps stabilize coastal environments. Sea goldenrod is an important species for coastal ecosystems due to its hardiness and ecological role."
