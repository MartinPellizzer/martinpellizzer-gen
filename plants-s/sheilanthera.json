    "intro": "Sheilanthera, commonly known as the orchid orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where they thrive in humid, shaded environments. Sheilanthera species typically have showy, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns and vibrant colors, often resembling other orchid genera. The plants have pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in their survival in variable climates. Their root systems are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil and air, making them well-suited for epiphytic growth on trees or rocks."
