    "intro": "Senegalia intsia, commonly known as the white thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and bipinnate leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers arranged in cylindrical clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it an important species for soil stabilization and livestock forage. Senegalia intsia is also valued for its hardiness and ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
