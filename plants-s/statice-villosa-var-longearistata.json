    "intro": "Statice villosa var. longearistata, commonly known as the long-bracted glasswort, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage covered in fine, velvety hairs, which help reduce water loss in saline environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or salt marshes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
