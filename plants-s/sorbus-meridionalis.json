    "intro": "Sorbus meridionalis, commonly known as the southern whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and alternate, simple leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrubland habitats. Sorbus meridionalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
