    "intro": "Salix jinchuanica, commonly known as the Jinchuan willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Salix jinchuanica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
