    "intro": "Stemmadenia nervosa, commonly known as the creeping stemmadenia, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Stemmadenia nervosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
