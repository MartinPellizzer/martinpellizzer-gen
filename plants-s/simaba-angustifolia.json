    "intro": "Simaba angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf simaba, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
