    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 sendaica var. eriocarpa, commonly known as the silver willow, is a hybrid species within the Salicaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, yellowish-green leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and streams. The silver willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
