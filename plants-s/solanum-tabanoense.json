    "intro": "Solanum tabanoense, commonly known as the Tabanoese nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that change color from green to red as they mature. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. Solanum tabanoense is known for its potential medicinal properties, though it contains toxic alkaloids that require careful handling."
