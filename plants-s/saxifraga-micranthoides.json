    "intro": "Saxifraga micranthoides, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, often succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or tundra habitats. Saxifraga micranthoides is well adapted to cold climates and is a common species in the Saxifragaceae family."
