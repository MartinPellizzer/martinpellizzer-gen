    "intro": "Spathodea pentandra, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical tree native to Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy, orange-red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody pods containing flat, seed-rich seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The tree has a spreading canopy and can grow up to 20 meters tall, making it a striking feature in gardens and landscapes."
