    "intro": "Salix retusa var. serpillifolia, commonly known as the silky willow, is a variant of the silky willow that exhibits distinctive botanical features. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree with slender, flexible branches that often droop gracefully. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of silky, grayish-white hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy appearance. It produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, typical of willow species. This plant thrives in moist environments and is often found near water bodies, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
