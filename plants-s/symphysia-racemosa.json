    "intro": "Symphysia racemosa, commonly known as the mountain mistflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a slender, upright stem that bears opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its most distinctive feature is its showy, terminal inflorescence composed of small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in a raceme. Symphysia racemosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
