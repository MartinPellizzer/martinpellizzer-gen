    "intro": "Sophora davidi, commonly known as the Chinese wisteria, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, clustered purple flowers. The plant is notable for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil through its root nodules. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not properly managed."
