    "intro": "Sherbournia batesii subsp. kivuensis, commonly known as the Kivu mountain heath, is a shrub native to the Albertine Rift region of Central Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, with small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the wet season, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in mountainous or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
