    "intro": "Spyridium buxifolium, commonly known as the box-leaved spyridium, is a small shrub native to southern Australia. It features dense, compact growth with small, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are reminiscent of boxwood, giving it its common name. It is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
