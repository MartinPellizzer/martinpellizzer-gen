    "intro": "Sedum topsentii, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in sandy soils. Its low-growing habit and ability to tolerate extreme temperatures make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
