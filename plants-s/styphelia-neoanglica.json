    "intro": "Styphelia neoanglica, commonly known as the New Zealand snowbell, is a small evergreen shrub native to the cool, humid forests of New Zealand. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. Styphelia neoanglica thrives in shaded, acidic soils and is often found in association with other understory plants in temperate rainforests."
