    "intro": "Semiliquidambar caudata var. cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sweetgum, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its distinctive, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, round, spiky fruits that are a source of food for wildlife. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and its wood is valued for its durability and workability. The plant has a moderate to fast growth rate and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
