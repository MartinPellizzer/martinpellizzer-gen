    "intro": "Sedum perpusillum, commonly known as dwarf sedum, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color, arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces tiny, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
