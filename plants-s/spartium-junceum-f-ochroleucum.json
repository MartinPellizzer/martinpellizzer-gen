    "intro": "Spartium junceum f. ochroleucum, commonly known as the white-stemmed goldenweed, is a variant of the goldenweed plant characterized by its pale yellow to white stems. It is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe and North Africa. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture, and it produces small, yellow flowers in early summer. The botanical features of this form make it distinct from other Spartium species, particularly in its stem coloration and habitat preferences."
