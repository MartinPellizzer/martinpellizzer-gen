    "intro": "Simira multiflora, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the wet season. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate, with a glossy upper surface and a lighter underside. The tree is often found in lowland rainforests and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan."
