    "intro": "Sagina glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, clustered leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving the plant its common name. The flowers are typically white or pink, with five petals and numerous stamens, and bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The plant is known for its ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion."
