    "intro": "Sonchus longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, surrounded by pale green to white bracts. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in cultivated fields. Its rapid growth and widespread distribution make it both a common weed and a plant of ecological interest."
