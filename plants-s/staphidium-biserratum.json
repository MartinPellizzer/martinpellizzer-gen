    "intro": "Staphidium biserratum, commonly known as the rough-stemmed sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Staphidium biserratum is adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss."
