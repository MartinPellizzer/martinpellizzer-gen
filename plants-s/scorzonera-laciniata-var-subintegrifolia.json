    "intro": "Scorzonera laciniata var. subintegrifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved scorzonera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features a robust taproot system, which is often harvested for its edible tubers. The plant has lance-shaped, deeply lobed leaves that are typically broader than those of the typical variety. Its flowers are yellow with purple veins, appearing in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats."
