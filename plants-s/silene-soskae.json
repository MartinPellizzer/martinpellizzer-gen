    "intro": "Silene soskae, commonly known as the Soska's campion, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Silene soskae is notable for its small, lance-shaped leaves and its role in supporting local pollinator populations. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
