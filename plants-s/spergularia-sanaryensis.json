    "intro": "Spergularia sanaryensis, commonly known as the Sanary's sandspurry, is a low-growing annual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dunes. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to tolerate saline and arid conditions, making it an important species in ecological studies of xerophytic vegetation."
