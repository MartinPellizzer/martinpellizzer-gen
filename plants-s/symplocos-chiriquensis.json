    "intro": "Symplocos chiriquensis, commonly known as the Chiriqu\u00ed symplocos, is a shrub native to Central America, particularly found in the humid lowland forests of Panama and Costa Rica. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are typically red when mature, which are an important food source for various bird species. Symplocos chiriquensis thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in association with other understory plants in tropical rainforests."
