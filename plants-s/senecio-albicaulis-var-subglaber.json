    "intro": "Senecio albicaulis var. subglaber, commonly known as the white-stemmed groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The leaves are typically grayish-green and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and sagebrush steppe. This variety is distinguished by its reduced leaf hairs compared to other varieties of Senecio albicaulis."
