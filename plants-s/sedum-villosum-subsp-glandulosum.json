    "intro": "Sedum villosum subsp. glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to parts of North America. It features fleshy, upright stems covered in fine, glandular hairs, which give it its subspecific name. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically blue-green and have a slightly waxy texture, adapted to retain moisture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
