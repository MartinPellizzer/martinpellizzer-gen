    "intro": "Sphaeropteris quindiuensis, commonly known as the Quind\u00edo cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the mountainous regions of Colombia. It belongs to the cycad family, characterized by its stout trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant is notable for its unique leaf morphology, with thick, leathery foliage that can reach several meters in length. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the specific microclimates of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
