    "intro": "Specklinia imberbis, commonly known as the bare-hair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hairless structures. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are short and thick, anchoring it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. Specklinia imberbis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
