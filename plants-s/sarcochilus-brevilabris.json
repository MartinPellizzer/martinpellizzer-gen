    "intro": "Sarcochilus brevilabris, commonly known as the short-lipped sarcochilus, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowering structures. The plant produces linear, dark green leaves and bears showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange. Its flowers are characterized by a short, narrow lip and a spurred column, typical of the Sarcochilus genus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
