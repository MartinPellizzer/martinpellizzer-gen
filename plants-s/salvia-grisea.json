    "intro": "Salvia grisea, commonly known as silver sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features gray-green, fuzzy leaves and produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and long-lasting blooms make it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Salvia grisea is also valued for its traditional medicinal uses among indigenous peoples."
