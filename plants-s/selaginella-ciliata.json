    "intro": "Selaginella ciliata, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with delicate, thread-like leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. Selaginella ciliata reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called strobila. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in humid conditions."
