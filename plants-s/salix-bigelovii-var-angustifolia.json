    "intro": "Salix bigelovii var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It features slender, often multi-branched stems with a smooth, gray bark. The leaves are elongated, lance-shaped, and have a finely serrated margin, typically appearing bright green in summer. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination and seed dispersal. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils."
