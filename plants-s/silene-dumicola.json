    "intro": "Silene dumicola, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. Silene dumicola is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its foliage is usually gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss."
