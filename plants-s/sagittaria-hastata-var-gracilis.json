    "intro": "Sagittaria hastata var. gracilis, commonly known as slender arrowhead, is a wetland plant characterized by its distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spikes during the summer months. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland environments."
