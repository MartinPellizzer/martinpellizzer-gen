It features succulent, fleshy leaves that help retain water in dry conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in coastal dunes and salt marshes, contributing to soil stabilization. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
