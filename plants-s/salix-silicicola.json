    "intro": "Salix silicicola, commonly known as the siliceous willow, is a species of willow native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of siliceous (silica-containing) hairs. The plant thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and stream banks, and is adapted to moist, often poorly drained soils. Its flowers are catkins, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Salix silicicola plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
