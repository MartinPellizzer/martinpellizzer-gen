    "intro": "Sedum cockerellii, commonly known as the Cockerell's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a dense rosette, which help it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its low maintenance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for desert landscapes."
