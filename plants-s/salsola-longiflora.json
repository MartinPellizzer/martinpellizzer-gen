    "intro": "Salsola longiflora, commonly known as long-flowered Russian thistle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Amaranthaceae family. It is a shrub-like annual plant characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, greenish flowers. Native to Eurasia, it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces achenes, which are dry, one-seeded fruits that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its invasive spread in new regions."
