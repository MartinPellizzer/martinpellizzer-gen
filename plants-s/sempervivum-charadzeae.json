    "intro": "Sempervivum charadzeae, commonly known as the Georgian houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the Caucasus region. It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with a bluish tint, often adorned with red or purple markings. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
