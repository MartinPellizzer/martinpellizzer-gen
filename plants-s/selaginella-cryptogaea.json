It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its intricate, branching structure and small, scale-like leaves. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Selaginella cryptogaea is also notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its historical significance in botanical studies."
