    "intro": "Stipa hemipogon, commonly known as the narrowleaf wild oat, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a compact, spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed spikelets. Stipa hemipogon plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife and livestock."
