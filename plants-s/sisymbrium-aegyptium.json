It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm and has pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods containing several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Sisymbrium aegyptium is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas, making it both a weed and a plant of ecological interest."
