    "intro": "Sambucus laciniata, commonly known as the cutleaf elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic seeds that should be avoided. Sambucus laciniata is often found in moist woodlands and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
