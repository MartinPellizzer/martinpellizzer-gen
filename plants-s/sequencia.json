It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its delicate foliage and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.
