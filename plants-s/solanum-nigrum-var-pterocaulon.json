    "intro": "Solanum nigrum var. pterocaulon, commonly known as the black nightshade variant with winged stems, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces berries that turn from green to black as they mature, often containing toxic compounds. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, waste areas, and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it distinguishable from other Solanum species, particularly through its unique stem morphology."
