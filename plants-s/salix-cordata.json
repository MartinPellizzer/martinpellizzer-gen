    "intro": "Salix cordata, commonly known as heartleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically 2 to 4 inches long and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Salix cordata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
