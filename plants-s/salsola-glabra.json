    "intro": "Salsola glabra, commonly known as tumbleweed, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its succulent stems and small, greenish-gray leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by dry, wind-dispersed fruits. Its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments makes it a common weed in disturbed soils. Salsola glabra is also known for its role in stabilizing soils and preventing erosion in desert areas."
