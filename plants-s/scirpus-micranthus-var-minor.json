    "intro": "Scirpus micranthus var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. The plant features tall, cylindrical stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can spread vegetatively, contributing to its success in wetland environments. This species is valued for its ecological role in filtering water and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
