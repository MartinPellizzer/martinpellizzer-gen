It is characterized by its fragrant, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in shades of white to pale purple. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with smooth margins, which give it its species name \"integrifolia.\" It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its attractive autumn foliage, which turns a striking yellow or orange."
