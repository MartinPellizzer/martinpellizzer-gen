    "intro": "Selaginella columbiana, commonly known as the Columbia spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss found in the western United States. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a creeping stem with whorled leaves that are often spirally arranged. It produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are borne on the upper part of the stem. Selaginella columbiana is notable for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
