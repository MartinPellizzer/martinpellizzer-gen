    "intro": "Scorzonera crepioides, commonly known as the crepe scabious, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features hairy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Scorzonera crepioides is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny conditions."
