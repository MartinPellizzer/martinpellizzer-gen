    "intro": "Sagittaria natans var. lorata, commonly known as the floating arrowhead, is a water plant native to the Americas. It features narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with roots submerged in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that emerge above the water, typically in late summer. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its dense growth helps stabilize water bodies and provides habitat for aquatic life."
