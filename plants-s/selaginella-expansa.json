    "intro": "Selaginella expansa, commonly known as the broad-leaf spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plant features scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems, and it produces spores in specialized structures called strobila. Selaginella expansa is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its role in soil stabilization. Its morphology and reproductive structures make it an important species in the study of early land plant evolution."
