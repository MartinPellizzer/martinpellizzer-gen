    "intro": "Sorghum lepidum, commonly known as slender sorghum, is a flowering plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, arid environments and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Sorghum lepidum is sometimes cultivated for its seeds, which can be used as a food source or forage."
