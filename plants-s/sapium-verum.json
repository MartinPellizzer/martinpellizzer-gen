    "intro": "Sapium verum, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It features alternate, simple, and ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, three-lobed fruits that contain three seeds each. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common ornamental plant, though it can become invasive in some regions. The plant has a smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age."
