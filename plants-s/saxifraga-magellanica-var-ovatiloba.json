It thrives in rocky, coastal environments and is adapted to harsh, maritime climates. The plant features succulent, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing protection against strong winds and salt spray. Its small, white or pink flowers bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to its rugged habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
