    "intro": "Sorbus domestica var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces large, edible berries that are typically dark red to black in color, which are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in autumn. The bark is smooth and greyish, becoming fissured with age, and the plant is often found in woodland edges and rocky habitats."
