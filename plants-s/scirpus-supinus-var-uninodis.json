    "intro": "Scirpus supinus var. uninodis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 1 millimeter wide, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. This variant is distinguished by its single node on the stem, which sets it apart from other Scirpus species."
