    "intro": "Sphacophyllum candelabrum, commonly known as the candlestick lichen, is a foliose lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, flattened, lobed thallus that often forms a candle-like shape, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on tree bark, especially on conifers, in temperate and boreal forest regions. Its color ranges from pale green to yellowish-green, and it lacks true leaves but has a photosynthetic cortex. Sphacophyllum candelabrum is known for its slow growth and is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
