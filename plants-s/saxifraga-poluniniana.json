    "intro": "Saxifraga poluniniana, commonly known as the Polunin's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are usually succulent and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to retain moisture in harsh environments. Saxifraga poluniniana is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
