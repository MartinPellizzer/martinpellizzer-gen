    "intro": "Solanum amygdalifolium, commonly known as the almond-leaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features simple, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its flowers are typically white or pale purple, with five petals. The plant produces small, green berries that turn red when mature, containing seeds enclosed in a fleshy pulp. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
