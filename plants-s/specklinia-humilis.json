    "intro": "Specklinia humilis, commonly known as the lowland speckled fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on trees in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has delicate, intricately divided fronds that are often covered in fine, speckled markings. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Specklinia humilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ease of care in the right conditions."
