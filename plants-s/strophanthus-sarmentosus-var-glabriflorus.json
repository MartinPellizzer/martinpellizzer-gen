    "intro": "Strophanthus sarmentosus var. glabriflorus, commonly known as the smooth-flowered strophanthus, is a climbing shrub native to tropical Africa. It features woody stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground or climb other vegetation. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a velvety texture. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potentially toxic alkaloids."
