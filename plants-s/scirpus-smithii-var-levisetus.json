    "intro": "Scirpus smithii var. levisetus, commonly known as the smooth bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, and its dense, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, three-lobed flowers. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically emerging from the base of the plant. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, hairless surfaces and its ability to thrive in shallow water or moist soils. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
