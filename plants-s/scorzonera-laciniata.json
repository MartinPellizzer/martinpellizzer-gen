    "intro": "Scorzonera laciniata, commonly known as the Italian scorzonera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust taproot that is often harvested for its edible, tuberous roots, which have a nutty flavor. The plant produces basal leaves that are deeply lobed and hairy, with a bluish-green hue. Its flowers are yellow with five petals and are typically borne on tall, slender stems. Scorzonera laciniata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
