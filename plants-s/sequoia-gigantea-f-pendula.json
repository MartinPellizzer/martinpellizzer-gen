    "intro": "Sequoia gigantea f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping giant sequoia, is a unique variant of the giant sequoia. It is characterized by its cascading, drooping branches that give it a distinctive, ethereal appearance. This form is a natural mutation of the typical upright giant sequoia, resulting in a more delicate and ornamental structure. The leaves are scale-like and arranged in whorls, typical of the Sequoia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun, though it is less hardy than its upright counterpart."
