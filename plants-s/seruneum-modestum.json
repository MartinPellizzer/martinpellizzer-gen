    "intro": "Seruneum modestum, commonly known as the modest serunea, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and moderately deep, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Seruneum modestum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and flowering habit."
