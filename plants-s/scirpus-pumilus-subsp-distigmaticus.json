    "intro": "Scirpus pumilus subsp. distigmaticus, commonly known as the dwarf bulrush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact, cylindrical flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with narrow, fibrous leaves that form a rosette at the base. Its flowers are clustered in spikes, and the subspecies is distinguished by its reduced number of spikelets compared to other Scirpus species. This plant plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
