    "intro": "Sasaella sakaigunensis, commonly known as the Japanese sasa, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its dense, clumping growth habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in panicles, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Sasaella sakaigunensis is often used in traditional Japanese landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, low-maintenance ground cover."
