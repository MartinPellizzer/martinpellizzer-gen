It features compound leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern, with each leaflet being lanceolate and often bearing a small, star-shaped stipule. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early summer, which are borne on elongated inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile addition to gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and prolonged flowering period."
