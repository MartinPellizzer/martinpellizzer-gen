It is characterized by its delicate, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and purple. The plant has a compact growth habit with small, narrow leaves arranged in a spiral pattern along its stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
