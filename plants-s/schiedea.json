    "intro": "Schiedea, commonly known as the Hawaiian sky flower, is a genus of flowering plants native to the Hawaiian Islands. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their striking, often brightly colored flowers that bloom at the top of their stems. Schiedea species are known for their unique adaptations to the island's diverse and often harsh environments. They possess specialized structures such as thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss and thrive in high-altitude regions. Many species are also noted for their slow growth and long lifespan, contributing to their rarity and ecological significance."
