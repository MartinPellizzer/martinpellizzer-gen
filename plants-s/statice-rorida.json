    "intro": "Statice rorida, commonly known as sea pink, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to white. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and along the seashore. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the stems are sturdy, allowing it to withstand coastal winds. Statice rorida is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh maritime conditions."
