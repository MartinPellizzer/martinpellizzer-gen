It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking, spurred flowers in shades of violet and white. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface and a compact growth habit. Its flowers are typically borne on upright spikes, and it blooms during the cooler months. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
