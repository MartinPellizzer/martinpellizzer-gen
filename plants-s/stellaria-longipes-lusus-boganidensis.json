    "intro": "Stellaria longipes lusus boganidensis, commonly known as the Boganidens starwort, is a rare and endemic species found in specific regions of Australia. It is a low-growing herb with slender stems and small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, and its flowers are often clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky outcrops and forest floors. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
