    "intro": "Sarcolobus hullsii, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Sarcolobus hullsii is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native range."
