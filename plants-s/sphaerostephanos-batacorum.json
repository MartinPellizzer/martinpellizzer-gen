    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos batacorum, commonly known as the Batacorum starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped blooms. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, while its flowers range in color from white to pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
