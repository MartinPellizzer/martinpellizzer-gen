    "intro": "Stemodia arenaria, commonly known as beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in the early morning, giving it its common name. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a hairy texture, adapted to withstand salty sea air and sandy soils. Stemodia arenaria is well-suited to coastal environments due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils."
