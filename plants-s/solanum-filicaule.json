    "intro": "Solanum filicaule, commonly known as the broadleaf nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers.

Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
