    "intro": "Stapelia deflexa, commonly known as the fleshy-stemmed Stapeliad, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, hooded flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insect species, such as flies and beetles. Stapelia deflexa is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
