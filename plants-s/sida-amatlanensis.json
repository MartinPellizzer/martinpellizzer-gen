    "intro": "Sida amatlanensis, commonly known as the Mexican mallow, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with hairy surfaces, and produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Sida amatlanensis is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
