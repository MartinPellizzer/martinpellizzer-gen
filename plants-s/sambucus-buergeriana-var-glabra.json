It features compound leaves with 5 to 7 pairs of oval, serrated leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, white to greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible when fully ripe but contain toxic seeds. It is valued for its ornamental value and use in traditional medicine."
