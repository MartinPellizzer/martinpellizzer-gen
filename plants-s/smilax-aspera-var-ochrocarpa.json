    "intro": "Smilax aspera var. ochrocarpa, commonly known as the yellow-stemmed smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It features woody stems covered in sharp, spiny tubercles, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating. This variant is distinguished by its yellowish stems and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and swamps."
