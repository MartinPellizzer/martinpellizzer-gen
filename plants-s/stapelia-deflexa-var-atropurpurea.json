    "intro": "Stapelia deflexa var. atropurpurea, commonly known as the Purple Ghost Stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that are often tinged with a deep purple or reddish hue, especially under bright light conditions. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically yellow with red or orange markings, resembling the appearance of a corpse, hence its common name. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. This variety is prized for its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
