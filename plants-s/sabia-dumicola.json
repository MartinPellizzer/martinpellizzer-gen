    "intro": "Sabia dumicola, commonly known as the desert sabia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to store water in its native habitat. Sabia dumicola is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in sandy soils, showing high tolerance to drought conditions."
