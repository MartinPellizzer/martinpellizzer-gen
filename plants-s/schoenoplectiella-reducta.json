It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly referred to as the sedge family. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its slender, grass-like stems are often densely clustered, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. The plant plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
