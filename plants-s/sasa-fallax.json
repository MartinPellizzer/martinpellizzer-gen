It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green, with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.
