    "intro": "Stenomeria fosteri, commonly known as the Hawaiian stenomeria, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, though it is not closely related to those plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy stems, typical of many members of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
