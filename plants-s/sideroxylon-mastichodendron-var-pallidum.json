    "intro": "Sideroxylon mastichodendron var. pallidum, commonly known as the pale mastichodendron, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly Kenya and Tanzania, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant is characterized by its woody structure, with thick, fissured bark that can reach several meters in height. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The pale mastichodendron produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsule fruits that contain seeds."
