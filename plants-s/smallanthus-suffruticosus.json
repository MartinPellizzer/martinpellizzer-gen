    "intro": "Smallanthus suffruticosus, commonly known as the Andean lupine, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of pink or purple flowers. It is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates and has a deep root system to access nutrients in poor soil. Smallanthus suffruticosus is also valued for its potential use in sustainable agriculture due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
