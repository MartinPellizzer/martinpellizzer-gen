    "intro": "Stellaria longipes lusus pluriflora, commonly known as the many-flowered starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It features slender, branching stems that bear small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy surface, and the plant produces small, rounded seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinator populations."
