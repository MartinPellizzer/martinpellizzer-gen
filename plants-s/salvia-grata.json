    "intro": "Salvia grata, commonly known as the graceful sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in soft, gray-green foliage. The plant produces striking spikes of violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Salvia grata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its aromatic leaves and showy flowers make it a valuable addition to both ornamental and medicinal gardens."
