    "intro": "Stichophyllum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant belonging to the family Restionaceae. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its striking, white, bell-shaped flowers that appear in late winter. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Stichophyllum thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
