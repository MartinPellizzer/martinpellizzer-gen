    "intro": "Salvia blancoana subsp. mariolensis, commonly known as the Mariolense blue sage, is a perennial herb native to the highlands of Mexico. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers and silver-green foliage, which are typical of the Salvia genus. The plant produces compact, upright growth with whorled leaves and spikes of tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
