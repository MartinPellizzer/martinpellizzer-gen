    "intro": "Stelis alismifolia, commonly known as the water lily orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of water lilies, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Stelis alismifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
