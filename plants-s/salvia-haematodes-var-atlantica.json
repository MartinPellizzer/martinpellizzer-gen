It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green leaves and spikes of violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and prefers full sun. It is often used in Mediterranean gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. Its scientific name reflects its distinctive red-tinged stems, which are a notable botanical feature."
