It is characterized by its clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and has a spreading, upright growth habit. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning red or orange in the fall. Spiraea dissomorpha prefers full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas."
