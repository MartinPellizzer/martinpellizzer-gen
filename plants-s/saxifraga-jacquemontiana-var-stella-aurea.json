    "intro": "Saxifraga jacquemontiana var. stella-aurea, commonly known as the golden star saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with bright green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white layer of wax. The plant produces showy, star-shaped yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
