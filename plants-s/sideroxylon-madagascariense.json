    "intro": "Sideroxylon madagascariense, commonly known as the Madagascar ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape and can be either smooth or hairy. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers and is typically found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
