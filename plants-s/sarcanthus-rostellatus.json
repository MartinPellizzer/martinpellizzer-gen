    "intro": "Sarcanthus rostellatus, commonly known as the horned cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the rainy season, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Sarcanthus rostellatus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
