    "intro": "Saxifraga cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra or mountainous habitats. Saxifraga cordifolia is well adapted to cold climates and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations."
