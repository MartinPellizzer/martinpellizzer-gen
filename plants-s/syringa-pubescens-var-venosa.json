    "intro": "Syringa pubescens var. venosa, commonly known as the velvet honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, fuzzy silver-gray foliage that provides a striking visual contrast to its fragrant, tubular flowers. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to orange-red blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for garden landscapes. The variety is known for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions."
