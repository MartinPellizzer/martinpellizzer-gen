It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces distinctive red, berry-like fruits called rosehips in the fall, which are rich in vitamin C. Its foliage is typically dark green, turning reddish in autumn, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil."
