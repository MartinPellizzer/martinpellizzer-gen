    "intro": "Sulcorebutia tarabucoensis, commonly known as the Tarabuco sun rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of Bolivia. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of white to pale yellow spines. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
