It is a small, annual plant that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny seeds. It is adapted to arid environments and is often used as a forage crop for livestock. Its rapid growth and drought tolerance make it an important plant in ecological and agricultural contexts."
