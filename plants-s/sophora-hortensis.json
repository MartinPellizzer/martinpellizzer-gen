    "intro": "Sophora hortensis, commonly known as the Japanese pagoda tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often have a silvery underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in late spring, followed by elongated pods that contain flat, seed-filled pods. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. The species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
