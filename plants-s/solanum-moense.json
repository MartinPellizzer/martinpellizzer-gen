    "intro": "Solanum moense, commonly known as the small nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 meter, featuring simple, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Solanum moense contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful if ingested. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is part of the nightshade family, Solanaceae."
