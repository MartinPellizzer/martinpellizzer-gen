    "intro": "Scirpus scabriculmis, commonly known as the rough-flowered bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its tall, stiff stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically greenish or brownish in color, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Scirpus scabriculmis plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. It is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
