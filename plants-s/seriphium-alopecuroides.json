    "intro": "Seriphium alopecuroides, commonly known as the prairie thistle, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The showy yellow flowers appear in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
