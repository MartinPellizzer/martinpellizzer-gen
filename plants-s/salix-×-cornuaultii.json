    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 cornuaultii, commonly known as the Cornuault's willow, is a hybrid species within the genus Salix, characterized by its distinctive botanical features. It typically exhibits narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside, which contribute to its unique appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollination, and it flowers in early spring. It is often found in wetland habitats, such as riverbanks and marshes, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
