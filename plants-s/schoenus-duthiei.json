    "intro": "Schoenus duthiei, commonly known as the Natal grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, wiry stems that are often\u4e1b\u751f, forming dense clumps. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce numerous tiny grains, which are adapted for wind pollination. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a tendency to form a rosette at the base."
