    "intro": "Stachys velata, commonly known as velvetleaf stachys, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves that give it its common name, and its flowering spikes that bear small, two-lipped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are often heart-shaped with a serrated margin, and it produces small, dark purple to brown seeds. Stachys velata is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive foliage and modest flowering display."
