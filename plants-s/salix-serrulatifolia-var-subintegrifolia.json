    "intro": "Salix serrulatifolia var. subintegrifolia, commonly known as the serrulate willow, is a variant of the serrulatifolia willow species. It is characterized by its finely serrated leaf margins, which give it a distinctive appearance. This plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments, such as streambanks and wet meadows. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal."
