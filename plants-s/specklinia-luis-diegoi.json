    "intro": "Specklinia luis-diegoi, commonly known as the Luis-Diego's fern, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and delicate, lace-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
