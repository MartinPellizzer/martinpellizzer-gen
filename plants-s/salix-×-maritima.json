    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 maritima, commonly known as the sea willow, is a hybrid shrub native to coastal areas of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and small, oval leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes, it plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems."
