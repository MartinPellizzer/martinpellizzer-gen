    "intro": "Salix sungkianica, commonly known as the Sungkianica willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. Salix sungkianica is often found in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest edges."
