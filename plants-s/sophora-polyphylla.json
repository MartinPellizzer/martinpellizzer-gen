It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often have a feathery appearance. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in late spring, which are usually blue to purple in color. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional Chinese medicine. The species is relatively slow-growing and requires well-drained soil to thrive."
