    "intro": "Sericocarpus, commonly known as the needlegrass or silvergrass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their slender, grass-like leaves and small, composite flower heads. Sericocarpus species typically grow in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. The fruits are dry, one-seeded, and often have a silky or hairy surface. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological roles in supporting pollinators."
