    "intro": "Statice ancarensis var. dasyphylla, commonly known as the woolly sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy blue or purple flower heads, which are composed of many tiny, tightly packed florets. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often growing in dune environments or along the edges of salt marshes. Its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
