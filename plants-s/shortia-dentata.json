    "intro": "Shortia dentata, commonly known as the Georgia snowbell, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have finely toothed margins, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
