It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pinkish to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
