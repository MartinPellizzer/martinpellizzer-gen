    "intro": "Saxifraga cespitosa subsp. delicatula, commonly known as the slender saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a dense mat of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements."
