    "intro": "Selaginella minima, commonly known as the lesser clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern ally native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant has a creeping rhizome with short, spirally arranged leaves that are often scale-like. It reproduces via spores, which are produced in small, cone-like structures called strobila. Due to its low-growing habit and ability to thrive in humid conditions, it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
