    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 wendelacina, commonly known as the wooly saxifrage, is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, silver-white foliage covered in soft, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens for its attractive appearance and hardy nature."
