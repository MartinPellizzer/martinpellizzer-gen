    "intro": "Staphylea bolanderi, commonly known as Bolander's bladderpod, is a rare flowering plant native to California. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that are inflated and bladder-like, giving it its common name. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in some areas."
