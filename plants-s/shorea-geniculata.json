    "intro": "Shorea geniculata, commonly known as the yellow meranti, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its large, buttressed roots and smooth, grey bark. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers and is known for its heavy, durable wood that is highly valued in the timber industry. It thrives in lowland rainforests and plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its habitat. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
