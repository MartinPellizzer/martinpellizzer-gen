    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum clausum, commonly known as the closed shade pine, is a rare and enigmatic conifer native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and unique cone structure, which differs from typical pine species. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Its slow growth rate and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, Sciodaphyllum clausum is considered vulnerable to environmental changes."
