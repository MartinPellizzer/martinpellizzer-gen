    "intro": "Silene nutans subsp. nutans, commonly known as the nodding catchfly, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species characterized by its slender stems and small, pink to purple flowers that droop downward. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
