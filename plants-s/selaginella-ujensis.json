    "intro": "Selaginella ujensis, commonly known as the Ujung Plain spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping stem with whorled leaves that are linear and often have a waxy coating. Selaginella ujensis is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique reproductive structures called microsporangia and megasporangia. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
