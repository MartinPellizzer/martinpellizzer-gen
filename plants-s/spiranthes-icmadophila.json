    "intro": "Spiranthes icmadophila, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ladies' tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense, spiraled inflorescence of pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. The species is relatively rare and is often found in specific ecological niches, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
