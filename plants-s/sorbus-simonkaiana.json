    "intro": "Sorbus simonkaiana, commonly known as the Simonka's rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Carpathian Mountains. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces berries that are red when mature, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
