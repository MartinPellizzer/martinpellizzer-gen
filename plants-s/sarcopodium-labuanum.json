    "intro": "Sarcopodium labuanum, commonly known as the Labuan liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It is a leafy liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or in forest floors. The plant has a thalloid structure composed of a central axis with leaf-like structures arranged in a spiral pattern. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a simple, undifferentiated body. Sarcopodium labuanum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for other small organisms."
