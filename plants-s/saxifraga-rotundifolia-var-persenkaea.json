    "intro": "Saxifraga rotundifolia var. persenkaea, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers emerging from rosettes of rounded, fleshy leaves. The leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh alpine environment. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
