    "intro": "Stenocereus humilis, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a columnar cactus native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It features a tall, cylindrical stem with ribbed, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, and it bears small, edible fruits resembling apples. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its structure and appearance make it a striking addition to desert landscapes."
