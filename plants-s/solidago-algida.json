    "intro": "Solidago algida, commonly known as the alpine goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Solidago algida plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native ecosystems."
