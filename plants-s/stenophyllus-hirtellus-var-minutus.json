    "intro": "Stenophyllus hirtellus var. minutus, commonly known as the small-hairy stenophyllus, is a rare and specialized plant species characterized by its small, hairy leaves and compact growth habit. It is typically found in specific microhabitats, such as rocky soils or shaded forest floors, where it thrives in humid, cool environments. The plant's leaves are usually narrow and have a dense covering of fine hairs, which may serve as a protective adaptation against environmental stressors. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in dense inflorescences, and it reproduces primarily through seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
