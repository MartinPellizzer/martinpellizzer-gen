    "intro": "Staehelina fruticosa, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fluffy, seed-bearing structures similar to those of dandelions. The plant has succulent leaves that store water, adapting to its dry environment. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep moisture sources. Staehelina fruticosa plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small desert creatures."
