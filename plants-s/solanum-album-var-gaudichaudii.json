    "intro": "Solanum album var. gaudichaudii, commonly known as the white nightshade, is a variant of the common nightshade species. It is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often at night, which is a characteristic of its nocturnal pollination strategy. Its leaves are ovate and slightly hairy, and the fruits are small berries that turn from green to yellow as they mature. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique floral display."
