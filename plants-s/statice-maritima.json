It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, showy flowers. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and tidal zones. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are usually bluish-green, and the flowers range in color from white to pink and purple. Statice maritima is well adapted to harsh maritime environments and is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms."
