    "intro": "Statice emarginata, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescences composed of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often growing in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its narrow, linear leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant wax. Statice emarginata is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes and is also used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms."
