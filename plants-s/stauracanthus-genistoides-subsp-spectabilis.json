    "intro": "Stauracanthus genistoides subsp. spectabilis, commonly known as the showy genistoid bush, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
