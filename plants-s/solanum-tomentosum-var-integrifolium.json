It features hairy, glandular leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries, which are often covered in a white, waxy coating. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
