It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of whitish to yellowish pigment. The plant typically grows on rocks or soil in temperate regions, forming dense, low-growing mats. Its structure consists of a thallus with distinct leaf-like structures and is often found in humid, forested areas. Selliguea oxyloba plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
