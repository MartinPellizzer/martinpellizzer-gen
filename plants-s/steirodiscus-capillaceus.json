    "intro": "Steirodiscus capillaceus, commonly known as the silky mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features delicate, thread-like leaves that give it its common name, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Steirodiscus capillaceus is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical structure supports its role as a nectar source for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
