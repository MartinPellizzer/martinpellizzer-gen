It is characterized by its striking two-toned leaves, which are typically dark green on top and silver-white underneath. The plant produces tall spikes of blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and showy blooms make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
