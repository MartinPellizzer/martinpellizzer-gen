    "intro": "Spirodela polyrhiza var. masonii, commonly known as the narrowleaf watermilfoil, is a floating aquatic plant native to North America. It has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm wide, arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, impacting water quality and native vegetation."
