    "intro": "Sida bilobulata, commonly known as the two-lobed sida, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species that typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white or pale pink. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Sida bilobulata is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
