It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length, with a distinctive silvery-white underside. The plant produces showy, umbel-like inflorescences composed of small, yellowish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
