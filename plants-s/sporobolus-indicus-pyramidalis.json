    "intro": "Sporobolus indicus pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramid grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and dense, pyramidal-shaped inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can tolerate drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. The plant is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a ornamental grass due to its distinctive appearance."
