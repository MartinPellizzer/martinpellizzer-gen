    "intro": "Sedum pubescens, commonly known as the wooly stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to North America. It features fleshy, upright stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are thick and succulent, adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant. Sedum pubescens thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
