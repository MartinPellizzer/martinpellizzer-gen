    "intro": "Sorghum controversum, commonly known as the controversial sorghum, is a tall, drought-tolerant grass native to Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and arid climates, making it an important crop in certain regions. Its botanical structure includes a robust stem with nodes and internodes, typical of the grass family. However, its name suggests some level of debate or controversy, possibly related to its use or classification."
