    "intro": "Setaria reflexa, commonly known as the rough dropseed, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies, open woodlands, and along roadsides. Setaria reflexa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
