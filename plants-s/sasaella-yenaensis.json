    "intro": "Sasaella yenaensis, commonly known as the Yena bamboo, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it forms dense clumps. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish itself in challenging environments. Sasaella yenaensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
