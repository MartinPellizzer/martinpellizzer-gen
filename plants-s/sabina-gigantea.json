    "intro": "Sabina gigantea, commonly known as the giant juniper, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and arranged in clusters. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with strong winds and intense sunlight. Sabina gigantea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
