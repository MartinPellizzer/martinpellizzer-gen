    "intro": "Stenospermum capitatum, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and dense, rounded crown. The tree produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, greenish-yellow fruits. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal properties."
