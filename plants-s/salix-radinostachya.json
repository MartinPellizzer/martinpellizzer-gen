    "intro": "Salix radinostachya, commonly known as the Tibetan willow, is a shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it thrives in cold, arid environments. Its adaptations to high-altitude conditions include a compact growth form and a high tolerance for extreme temperatures. Salix radinostachya plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
