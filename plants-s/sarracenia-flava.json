    "intro": "Sarracenia flava, commonly known as the yellow pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow, tubular leaves that function as pitfall traps to capture insects. The plant's specialized leaves secrete digestive enzymes to break down prey, providing essential nutrients in nutrient-poor soils. It thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. Its striking color and unique trapping mechanism make it a popular subject in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
