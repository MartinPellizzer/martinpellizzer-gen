    "intro": "Stelis fusisepala, commonly known as the broad-sepaled stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense, white tomentum. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with elongated sepals and petals that give it its common name. Stelis fusisepala thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
