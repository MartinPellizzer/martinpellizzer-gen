    "intro": "Strobilanthes rantii, commonly known as the Malayan flame flower, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories and thrives in tropical climates. Strobilanthes rantii is noted for its unique floral structure, which includes two pairs of showy bracts that enclose the actual flowers. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
