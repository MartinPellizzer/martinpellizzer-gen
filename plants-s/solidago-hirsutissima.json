    "intro": "Solidago hirsutissima, commonly known as rough goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and stream banks. Its leaves are rough to the touch, hence the species name *hirsutissima*, which means \"very hairy\" in Latin. The plant plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies during the late summer and early fall."
