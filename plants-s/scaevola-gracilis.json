    "intro": "Scaevola gracilis, commonly known as the slender fanflower, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, often arranged in clusters. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Scaevola gracilis is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
