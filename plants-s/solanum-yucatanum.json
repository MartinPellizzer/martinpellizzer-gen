    "intro": "Solanum yucatanum, commonly known as the Yucatan nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant produces small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. These berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic compounds in their unripe form. It is often found in dry, tropical, and semi-arid environments."
