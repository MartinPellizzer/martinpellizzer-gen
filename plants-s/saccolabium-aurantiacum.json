    "intro": "Saccolabium aurantiacum, commonly known as the yellow milkbush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its woody stems and dense foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant is also known for its milky sap, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus Saccolabium."
