It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. It has a low, spreading growth habit and often forms dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion.
