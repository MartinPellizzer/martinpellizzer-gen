    "intro": "Spilotantha ferrusii, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to hot, dry conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Spilotantha ferrusii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
