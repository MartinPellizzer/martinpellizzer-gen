    "intro": "Schollera paludosa, commonly known as the marsh schollera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in South America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers during the spring and early summer. Schollera paludosa is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding and has a rhizomatous root system that helps it survive in waterlogged conditions. Its presence is often an indicator of healthy wetland ecosystems."
