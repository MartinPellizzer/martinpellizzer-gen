    "intro": "Salix metaglauca, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and grayish-white bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth margin and a pale green underside, and they turn yellow in the fall. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in riparian zones."
