    "intro": "Stipa flavescens, commonly known as the yellow feather grass, is a perennial grass native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and fluffy, golden seed heads that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a wiry texture, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Stipa flavescens is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
