    "intro": "Saccolabium bigibbum, commonly known as the two-lobed saccolabium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces showy, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate periods of drought. The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in supporting local pollinators and its resilience in harsh environments."
