    "intro": "Shawia propinqua, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Viscaceae and typically grows on the branches of oak trees, relying on its host for water and nutrients while producing its own food through photosynthesis. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pale green berries that are toxic to humans and livestock. Its life cycle involves bird dispersal of its seeds, which adhere to the bark of host trees and germinate after the host's wounds. Shawia propinqua plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain birds and insects."
