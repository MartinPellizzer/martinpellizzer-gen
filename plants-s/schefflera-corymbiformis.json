It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like crown of large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in corymbs, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil. Schefflera corymbiformis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit."
