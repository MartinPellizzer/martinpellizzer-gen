    "intro": "Stelis situlifera, commonly known as the basket orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with multiple stems forming a rosette-like structure. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in a raceme, with a distinctive basket-like shape that gives it its common name. Stelis situlifera prefers humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
