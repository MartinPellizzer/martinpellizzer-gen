    "intro": "Siphocampylus sanchezii, commonly known as the Sanchezia false forget-me-not, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, and it typically grows in rocky or limestone soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
