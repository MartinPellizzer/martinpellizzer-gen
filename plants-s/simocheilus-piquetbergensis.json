    "intro": "Simocheilus piquetbergensis, commonly known as the Piquetberg cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to South Africa. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
