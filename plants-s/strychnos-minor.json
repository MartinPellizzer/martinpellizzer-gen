    "intro": "Strychnos minor, commonly known as the lesser strychnos, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy aril. It is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
