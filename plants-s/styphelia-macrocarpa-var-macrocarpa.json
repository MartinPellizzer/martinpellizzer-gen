    "intro": "Styphelia macrocarpa var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features dense clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss in its arid or coastal habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and rocky areas. Styphelia macrocarpa var. macrocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
