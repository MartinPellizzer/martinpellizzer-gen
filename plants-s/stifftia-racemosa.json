    "intro": "Stifftia racemosa, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 10 to 30 centimeters, featuring woody stems and small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces bright yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are followed by small, hairy fruits that disperse seeds via the wind. Stifftia racemosa is adapted to harsh desert conditions, with deep roots and a high tolerance for drought."
