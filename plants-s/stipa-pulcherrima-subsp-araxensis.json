    "intro": "Stipa pulcherrima subsp. araxensis, commonly known as the Arax Valley feathergrass, is a grass species native to the highlands of eastern Turkey. It is characterized by its slender, wiry culms and dense, fluffy panicles that give it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are wind-pollinated, a common trait among grasses. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly larger size and more robust growth compared to other members of the Stipa pulcherrima complex."
