    "intro": "Salix paraphylicifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are typically green on top and hairy underneath. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its main means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
