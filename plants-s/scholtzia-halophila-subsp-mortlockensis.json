    "intro": "Scholtzia halophila subsp. mortlockensis, commonly known as the Mortlock Island scholtzia, is a flowering plant native to the remote Mortlock Islands in the Pacific Ocean. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in saline and coastal environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months. It is adapted to withstand high salt levels and strong coastal winds. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
