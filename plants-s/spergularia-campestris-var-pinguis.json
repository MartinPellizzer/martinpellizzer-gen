It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and stems. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in disturbed or open habitats. Its flowers are small, pink or white, and appear in clusters, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The variety 'pinguis' is distinguished by its notably thick and fleshy leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments."
