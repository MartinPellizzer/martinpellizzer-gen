    "intro": "Sciaphila inaequalis, commonly known as the unequal ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the rainy season. This epiphytic plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches in primary forests. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and its specific ecological requirements, Sciaphila inaequalis is considered endangered."
