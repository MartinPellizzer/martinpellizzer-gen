    "intro": "Selaginella yemensis, commonly known as the Yemen spikemoss, is a rare and endemic vascular plant native to the highlands of Yemen. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures called strobili. The plant exhibits a unique adaptation to arid environments, with a succulent stem that helps store water. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for microorganisms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Selaginella yemensis is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
