    "intro": "Schizoglossum glanvillei, commonly known as the Glanville's spurge, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant has thick, water-storing leaves that help it survive in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow and are borne in clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Schizoglossum glanvillei is adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in desert environments."
