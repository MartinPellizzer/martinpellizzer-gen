    "intro": "Sanguinaria vaginata, commonly known as the red-pelted bloodroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae and is characterized by its reddish-orange sap, which gives it its common name. The plant features a single, erect stem with a basal leaf that is often sheathing, hence the specific epithet *vaginata*. Its showy, white to pink flowers bloom in early spring, followed by capsule fruits that release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Sanguinaria vaginata is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
