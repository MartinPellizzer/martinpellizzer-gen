It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant produces small, oval berries that turn from green to yellow when mature. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and peppers. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated for food or ornamental purposes."
