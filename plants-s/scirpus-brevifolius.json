It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces cylindrical spikes of small, brown flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and contribute to wetland ecosystems. Scirpus brevifolius plays an important role in filtering water and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
