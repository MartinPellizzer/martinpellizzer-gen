    "intro": "Sagittaria secundifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a narrow, linear form. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically emerging above the water surface. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to water filtration and habitat for aquatic life. Sagittaria secundifolia is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting biodiversity in wetland ecosystems."
