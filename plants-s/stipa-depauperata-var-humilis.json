    "intro": "Stipa depauperata var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf feathergrass, is a low-growing grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features fine, wiry leaves and produces delicate, feathery inflorescences that are characteristic of the Stipa genus. This variety is distinguished by its compact growth habit and shorter stature compared to other Stipa species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping for its elegant, wind-swaying appearance."
