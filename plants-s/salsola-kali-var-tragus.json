It is an annual or biennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant has a robust, sprawling growth habit with spiny stems and small, fleshy leaves. Its flowers are clustered in dense, pink to purplish inflorescences, and it produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind.
