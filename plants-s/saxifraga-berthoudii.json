It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of up to 10 centimeters. The plant features rosettes of fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. Its small, white or pinkish flowers bloom in early summer, usually in clusters at the ends of stems. Saxifraga berthoudii thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
