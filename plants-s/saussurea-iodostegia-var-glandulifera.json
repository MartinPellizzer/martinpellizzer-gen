    "intro": "Saussurea iodostegia var. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular-stemmed saussurea, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It is a perennial herb with a robust root system and tall, hairy stems that bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers arranged in a panicle inflorescence. Its leaves and stems are often covered with glandular hairs, which secrete oils and contribute to its aromatic properties. This species is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
