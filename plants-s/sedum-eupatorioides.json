    "intro": "Sedum eupatorioides, commonly known as the silver rose or stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, gray-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature allows it to tolerate a wide range of climates, from temperate to mildly frosty regions."
