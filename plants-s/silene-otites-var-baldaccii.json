    "intro": "Silene otites var. baldaccii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada range in California. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to the harsh, alpine environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
