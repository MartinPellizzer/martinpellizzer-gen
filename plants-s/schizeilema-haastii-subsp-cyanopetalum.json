    "intro": "Schizeilema haastii subsp. cyanopetalum, commonly known as the blue-petaled schizeilema, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive blue or violet petals, which are unusual for the genus. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and the flowers are arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
