    "intro": "Silene nutans var. livida, commonly known as the pale-flowered bladderwort, is a flowering plant in the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to regions of Europe and western Asia, often found in moist, calcareous habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds by wind. This species is notable for its delicate appearance and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
