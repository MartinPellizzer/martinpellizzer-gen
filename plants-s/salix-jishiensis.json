    "intro": "Salix jishiensis, commonly known as the Jishi willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, oval leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring. Salix jishiensis is adapted to high-altitude environments, exhibiting tolerance to cold and arid conditions. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
