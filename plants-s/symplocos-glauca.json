    "intro": "Symplocos glauca, commonly known as the bluebead lily, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early summer, followed by blue-black berries that are edible for some bird species. Symplocos glauca thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
