    "intro": "Senecio anacephalus, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky soils and dry landscapes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Senecio anacephalus is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads."
