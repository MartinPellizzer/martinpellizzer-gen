    "intro": "Synarrhena, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its showy, blue to purple composite flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant is native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico, where it thrives in moist, sunny environments. Synarrhena species typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and are often used in native plant gardens for their ornamental value. The genus is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
