    "intro": "Solanum saponaceum var. uruguense, commonly known as the Uruguayan nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America, particularly Uruguay and parts of Argentina. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, violet to purple flowers. The plant produces small, yellow berries that contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and riverine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires caution due to its toxic properties."
