    "intro": "Scilla nivalis subsp. subnivalis, commonly known as the alpine scilla, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. This subspecies thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Its flowers are typically short-lived, appearing just long enough to attract pollinators before the snow begins to melt. The plant is adapted to cold climates and is often found in areas with limited soil nutrients."
