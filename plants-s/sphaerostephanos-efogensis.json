    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos efogensis, commonly known as the golden globe orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, spherical flower buds that resemble small golden globes, which open to reveal intricate, colorful petals. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowering period occurs during the late spring to early summer months, adding a rare and beautiful display to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
