    "intro": "Simsia foetida var. megacephala, commonly known as the giant headed smilax, is a vigorous climbing plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in dense undergrowth. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in its native habitat."
