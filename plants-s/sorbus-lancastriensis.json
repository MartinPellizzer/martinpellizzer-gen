    "intro": "Sorbus lancastriensis, commonly known as the Lancashire whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to western Europe. It is characterized by its oval, leathery leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, white flowers in spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
