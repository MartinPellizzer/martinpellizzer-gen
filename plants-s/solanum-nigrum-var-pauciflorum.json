    "intro": "Solanum nigrum var. pauciflorum, commonly known as black nightshade, is a variant of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) characterized by its small, dark purple to black berries. It is a herbaceous perennial plant that typically grows in disturbed soils and arid environments. The plant features simple, alternate leaves with a rough texture and often has a strong, unpleasant odor. Its flowers are usually small, yellow, and clustered, and it produces berries that are toxic when unripe but can be used in some traditional cuisines when ripe. This variant is notable for its reduced flowering compared to the typical Solanum nigrum."
