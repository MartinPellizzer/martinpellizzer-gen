It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with hairy stems and alternate leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale purple, and it produces small, fleshy berries that contain toxic compounds. Due to its invasive nature, it is often found in disturbed soils and can be a weed in agricultural areas."
