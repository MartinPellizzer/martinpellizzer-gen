    "intro": "Stemonurus mollis, commonly known as the slender stemonurus, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and features slender, upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its overall delicate appearance.
