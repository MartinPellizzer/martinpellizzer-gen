    "intro": "Salix bebbiana, commonly known as Bebb willow, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, greenish female flowers, contributing to its wind-pollinated reproductive strategy. Bebb willow thrives in wet or moist environments, such as streambanks and wetlands, and is often found in the northern United States and southern Canada. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
