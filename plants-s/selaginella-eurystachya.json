    "intro": "Selaginella eurystachya, commonly known as the climbing maidenhair fern, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of true ferns, though it is not a fern but a spikemoss. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Selaginella eurystachya exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized structures. Its reproductive system involves the production of microspores and megaspores, which are released from sporangia located on the undersides of its leaves."
