It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features a low-growing habit with clustered stems and small, often hairy leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or white, arranged in dense clusters, and bloom in late summer. Saxifraga pseudobronchialis is adapted to cold climates and is often found in areas with high elevation and limited soil."
