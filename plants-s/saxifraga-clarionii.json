    "intro": "Saxifraga clarionii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky, alpine environments, often found in crevices and among gravelly soils. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Saxifraga clarionii is an important component of alpine ecosystems and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds."
