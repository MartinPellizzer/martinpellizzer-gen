    "intro": "Smilax sprengelii, commonly known as the red-berried smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often covered in sharp, recurved spines. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into bright red berries, which are an important food source for birds. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a serrated margin and can grow up to 10 centimeters in length. Smilax sprengelii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
