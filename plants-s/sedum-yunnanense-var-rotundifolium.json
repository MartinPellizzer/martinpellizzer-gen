    "intro": "Sedum yunnanense var. rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaved stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to China. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are circular in shape, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
