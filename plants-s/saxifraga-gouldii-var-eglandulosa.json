    "intro": "Saxifraga gouldii var. eglandulosa, commonly known as the glandular saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of New Zealand. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in spring, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
