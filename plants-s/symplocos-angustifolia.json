    "intro": "Symplocos angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf waxberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, elliptic leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. Symplocos angustifolia typically grows in moist, acidic soils in woodlands and stream banks, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
