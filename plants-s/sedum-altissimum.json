    "intro": "Sedum altissimum, commonly known as the tall stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer months. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, preferring full sun. Sedum altissimum is often used in rock gardens and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
