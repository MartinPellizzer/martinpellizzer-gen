    "intro": "Senegalia grazielae, commonly known as the Mexican mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Mexico and the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically bipinnate and covered in fine hairs, and its small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain edible seeds, which have been used by indigenous peoples for food and medicine. Senegalia grazielae is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
