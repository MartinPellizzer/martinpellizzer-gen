    "intro": "Sempervivum tectorum var. atlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic houseleek, is a low-growing succulent with fleshy, rosette-forming leaves. It originates from the coastal regions of the British Isles and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. The plant features a compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white. It is drought-tolerant and prefers full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in mild climates, though it may require protection in colder regions."
