    "intro": "Salix angstroemiana, commonly known as the Angstrom's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in high-altitude, arid environments. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollination, and its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped. It has a shallow root system, allowing it to anchor in rocky soils, and it is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. Salix angstroemiana is often found in alpine meadows and on rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
