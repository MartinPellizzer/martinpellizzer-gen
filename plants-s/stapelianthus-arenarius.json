    "intro": "Stapelianthus arenarius, commonly known as the sand stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting pollinators like moths. Its leaves are typically reduced to small scales, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. Stapelianthus arenarius is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
