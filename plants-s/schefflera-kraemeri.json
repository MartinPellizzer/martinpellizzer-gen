    "intro": "Schefflera kraemeri, commonly known as the African schefflera, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles. Its foliage is typically dark green and glossy, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Schefflera kraemeri thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
