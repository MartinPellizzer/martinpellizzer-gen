    "intro": "Stevia ovata, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered with tiny, glandular structures. The plant is renowned for its intense sweet taste, which comes from compounds called steviol glycosides. Stevia ovata typically grows in humid, tropical environments and thrives in well-drained soil. It is often cultivated as a natural sweetener and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
