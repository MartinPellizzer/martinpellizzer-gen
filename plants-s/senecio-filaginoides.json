It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, daisy-like yellow flowers surrounded by white ray florets, which bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss. Senecio filaginoides is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature."
