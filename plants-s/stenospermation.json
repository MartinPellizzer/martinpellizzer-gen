    "intro": "Stenospermation, commonly known as the narrow-seed plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated seeds and small, palmate leaves. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Stenospermation species are known for their showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Due to their limited distribution and specialized habitats, these plants are of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and conservation."
