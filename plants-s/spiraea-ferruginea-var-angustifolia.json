    "intro": "Spiraea ferruginea var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf weeping spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching branches that create a graceful, weeping appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are borne on the previous year's growth. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture, and turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
