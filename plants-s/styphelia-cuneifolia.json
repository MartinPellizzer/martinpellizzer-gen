    "intro": "Styphelia cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of New Zealand. It features small, glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in dense clusters along its stems. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late winter to early spring. Styphelia cuneifolia thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in heathland or coastal scrub environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
