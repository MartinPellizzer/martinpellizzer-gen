    "intro": "Sedum progressum, commonly known as the creeping sedum, is a succulent plant native to North America. It features fleshy, upright stems that can grow up to several feet in length, often sprawling across the ground. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water, making it drought-tolerant. Sedum progressum is often used in rock gardens or as ground cover due to its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements."
