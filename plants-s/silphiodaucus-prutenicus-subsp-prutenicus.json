    "intro": "Silphiodaucus prutenicus subsp. prutenicus, commonly known as the Prut River bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the region of the Prut River in Romania. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along riverbanks and wetlands. It has lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
