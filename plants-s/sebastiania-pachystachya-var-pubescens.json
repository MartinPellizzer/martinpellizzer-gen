    "intro": "Sebastiania pachystachya var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy sebastiania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. This variety is notable for its hairy texture on both its stems and leaves, which distinguishes it from other varieties within the species."
