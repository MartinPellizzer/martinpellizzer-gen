    "intro": "Sarracenia flava var. rugelii, commonly known as the rugelii pitcher plant, is a variant of the yellow pitcher plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, tubular leaves that form deep, pitcher-shaped traps to capture insects. The plant's bright yellow coloration is prominent in both the leaf surface and the inner trap walls. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. This species is notable for its unique morphology and ecological role in nutrient cycling within its habitat."
