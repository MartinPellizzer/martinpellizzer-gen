It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant has alternate, pinnately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small yellow flowers arranged in a cluster, followed by small, spiny seed capsules. Sonchus subbipinnatifidus is often found in disturbed soils and can be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
