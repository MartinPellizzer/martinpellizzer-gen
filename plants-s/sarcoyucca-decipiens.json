    "intro": "Sarcoyucca decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive yucca, is a striking plant native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that resembles a yucca but is actually a type of bromeliad. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, and they bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a notable species in tropical botany."
