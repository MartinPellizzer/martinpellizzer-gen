    "intro": "Stellaria elisabethiae, commonly known as the Elizabeth's starwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically has hairy stems and leaves that are opposite and lanceolate in shape. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
