    "intro": "Stelis weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in tropical rainforest environments. The plant features a short, upright stem with a few leaves and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded conditions and requires well-draining, loose substrate for optimal growth. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments by orchid enthusiasts."
