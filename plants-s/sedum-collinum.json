    "intro": "Sedum collinum, commonly known as mountain sedum, is a succulent plant native to North America. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are arranged in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Sedum collinum is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements and ornamental value."
