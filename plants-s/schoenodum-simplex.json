    "intro": "Schoenodum simplex, commonly known as the simple spike grass, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features a slender, upright stem that produces a dense cluster of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant's leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green color. Its flowers are typically pale green to white, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. Schoenodum simplex is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist environments."
