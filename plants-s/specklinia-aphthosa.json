It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant features delicate, leathery leaves that are often used in traditional Hawaiian medicine. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Specklinia aphthosa is native to the Hawaiian Islands and is considered a rare and endangered species."
