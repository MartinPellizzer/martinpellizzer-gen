    "intro": "Stapelia arida, commonly known as the desert carrion flower, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces large, waxy flowers that resemble decaying flesh, a feature that attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are often reduced to spines, further reducing water loss. Stapelia arida is well adapted to hot, dry environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
