    "intro": "Stenanthus heterophyllus, commonly known as the variable stenanthus, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which vary in shape and size along the stem, a feature that gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along streams. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
