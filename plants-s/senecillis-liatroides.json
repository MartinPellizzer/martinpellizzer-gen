    "intro": "Senecillis liatroides, commonly known as the goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Senecillis liatroides plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the fall season."
