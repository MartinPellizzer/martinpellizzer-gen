    "intro": "Selenicereus anthonyanus, commonly known as the ghost flower or night-blooming cereus, is a tropical cactus native to Central America. It is characterized by its spineless stems and large, fragrant white flowers that open at night. The plant produces yellow, fleshy fruits that are edible and often consumed by wildlife. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by moths and bats, which are attracted to its strong scent and nectar. The plant is adapted to grow in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments."
