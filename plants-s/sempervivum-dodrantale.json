    "intro": "Sempervivum dodrantale, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features fleshy, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, often with a powdery coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in cold climates, and it is often used as an ornamental plant in horticulture."
