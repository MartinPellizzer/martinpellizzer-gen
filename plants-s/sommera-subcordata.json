    "intro": "Sommera subcordata, commonly known as the broad-leafed sommera, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
