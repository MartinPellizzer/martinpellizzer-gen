    "intro": "Stobaea onopordifolia, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and dense, gray-green foliage adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in harsh environments, making it valuable for erosion control. Stobaea onopordifolia is also used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
