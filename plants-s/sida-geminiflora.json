It is a herbaceous annual with alternate, ovate leaves that are usually hairy. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from summer to fall. Sida geminiflora is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields and along roadsides. Its fibrous stems and leaves have been used traditionally in some regions for fiber and medicinal purposes."
