    "intro": "Staelia, commonly known as the bladder campion, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and coastal areas. Staelia has a rosette growth form, with leaves arranged in a tight cluster at the base. Its ability to store water in its thick leaves makes it well adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
