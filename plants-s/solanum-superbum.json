    "intro": "Solanum superbum, commonly known as the mountain nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its woody stems and hairy leaves. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are an important food source for certain wildlife species. Solanum superbum is often found in high-altitude regions and is adapted to cooler, temperate climates."
