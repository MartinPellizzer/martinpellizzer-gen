    "intro": "Salix pseudolapponum, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant has slender, often multi-branched stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. Its catkins are an important source of pollen for early-season pollinators. Salix pseudolapponum plays a significant role in stabilizing soil in its harsh native habitats."
