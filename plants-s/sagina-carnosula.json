    "intro": "Sagina carnosula, commonly known as stonecrop saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, sunny environments. Sagina carnosula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
