    "intro": "Sphaerocionium frankliniae, commonly known as the Franklinia, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are oval-shaped and glossy, and its showy, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a unique morphology, with a short trunk and dense foliage, and it produces small, round fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a symbol of conservation efforts."
