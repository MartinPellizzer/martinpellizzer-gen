It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant features a dense mat of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, with five petals and five sepals, blooming in early summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
