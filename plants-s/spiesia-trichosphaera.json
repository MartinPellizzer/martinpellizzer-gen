    "intro": "Spiesia trichosphaera, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in disturbed soils. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
