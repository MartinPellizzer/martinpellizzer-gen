    "intro": "Solanum rheithrocharis, commonly known as the red velvet nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its striking, velvety red flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators. Its leaves are typically dark green and oval-shaped, while the fruits are small, orange-red berries that contain the plant's toxic alkaloids. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
