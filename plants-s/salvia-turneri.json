    "intro": "Salvia turneri, commonly known as the desert sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It features narrow, gray-green leaves and produces striking spikes of violet to purple flowers during the summer months. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value. Salvia turneri is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
