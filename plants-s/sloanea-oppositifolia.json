    "intro": "Sloanea oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaf sloanea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its opposite arrangement of simple, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. Sloanea oppositifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in horticulture for its foliage. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for tropical and subtropical gardens."
