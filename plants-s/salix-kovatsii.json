    "intro": "Salix kovatsii, commonly known as Kovats' willow, is a species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces catkin-like flowers, which are typical of the Salicaceae family, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its range."
