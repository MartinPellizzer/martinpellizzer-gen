    "intro": "Schotia parvifolia, commonly known as the silver tree, is a member of the Proteaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which results from a waxy coating on the leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Schotia parvifolia is a slow-growing, evergreen tree that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
