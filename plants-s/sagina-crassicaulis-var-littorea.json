    "intro": "Sagina crassicaulis var. littorea, commonly known as sea sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in intertidal zones and salt marshes. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are tiny, pink or white, and appear in clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer. This hardy species is well adapted to saline and wind-exposed environments, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
