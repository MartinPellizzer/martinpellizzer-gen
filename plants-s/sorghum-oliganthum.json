    "intro": "Sorghum oliganthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sorghum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, arid environments and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. Its root system is deep, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. Sorghum oliganthum is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock."
