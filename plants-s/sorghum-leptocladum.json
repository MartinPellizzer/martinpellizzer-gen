    "intro": "Sorghum leptocladum, commonly known as the slender-leaved sorghum, is a species of grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in disturbed or open habitats. It produces small, dense spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of the stems. Sorghum leptocladum is primarily of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological adaptability and potential for use in agroforestry systems."
