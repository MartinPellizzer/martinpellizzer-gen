    "intro": "Stylosanthes macrosoma, commonly known as the large-stemmed stylo, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. Stylosanthes macrosoma is well adapted to dry conditions and is often used as forage for livestock in arid environments. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant in sustainable agricultural systems."
