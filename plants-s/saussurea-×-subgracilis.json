    "intro": "Saussurea \u00d7 subgracilis, commonly known as the hybrid Himalayan saffron, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, fibrous stems and large, showy composite flower heads that typically range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces numerous small, dark brown seeds enclosed in a fluffy pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
