    "intro": "Salix phylicifolia var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20136 meters, featuring slender branches and heart-shaped leaves with a smooth, dark green upper surface. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination and seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers, streams, and wetlands. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
