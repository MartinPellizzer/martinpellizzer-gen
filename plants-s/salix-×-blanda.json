    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 blanda, commonly known as the weeping willow hybrid, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that create a cascading appearance, often with a weeping or pendulous habit. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and typically heart-shaped with a smooth margin. Salix \u00d7 blanda thrives in moist soils and is often found near streams, wetlands, or in areas with high groundwater."
