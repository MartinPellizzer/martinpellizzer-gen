    "intro": "Solanum hastiforme, commonly known as the heart-shaped nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature, containing seeds inside. Solanum hastiforme is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
