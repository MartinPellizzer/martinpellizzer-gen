    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 valsoreyana, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree that belongs to the Salicaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Salix viminalis (commonly known as osier) and Salix triandra. The plant is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and lance-shaped leaves that are often gray-green in color. It thrives in moist environments, such as riverbanks and wetlands, and is commonly used for basket weaving due to its flexible stems. Salix \u00d7 valsoreyana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in riparian habitats."
