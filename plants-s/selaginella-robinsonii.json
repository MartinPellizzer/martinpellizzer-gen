    "intro": "Selaginella robinsonii, commonly known as the Robinson's spikemoss, is a rare and endangered species of spikemoss native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has slender, wiry stems that bear small, scale-like leaves, and it produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important subject for botanical study and conservation efforts. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it faces significant threats to its survival in the wild."
