    "intro": "Scolymocephalus penicillatus, commonly known as the penicillate scolymus, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its distinctive, feathery foliage. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. The species is native to certain regions of southern Europe and is often found in rocky or limestone soils. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
