It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often planted near water bodies. Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in gardens and parks."
