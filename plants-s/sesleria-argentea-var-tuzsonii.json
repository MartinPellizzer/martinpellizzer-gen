    "intro": "Sesleria argentea var. tuzsonii, commonly known as silver moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and silvery-gray foliage due to the dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to white spikelets that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in open habitats such as heaths and moorlands. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting local insect populations."
