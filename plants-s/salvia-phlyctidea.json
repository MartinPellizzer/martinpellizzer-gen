    "intro": "Salvia phlyctidea, commonly known as desert sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, woolly foliage and spikes of violet to blue-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to hot, dry environments and has a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration. Salvia phlyctidea is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
