    "intro": "Spiraea martini, commonly known as the alpine spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has dark green, ovate leaves that are slightly hairy on the underside. It prefers well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. Spiraea martini is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and seasonal floral display."
