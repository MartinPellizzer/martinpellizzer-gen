    "intro": "Smelowskia calycina subsp. integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf smelowskia, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its simple, entire leaves that are typically smooth and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with showy, pinkish-white petals. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
