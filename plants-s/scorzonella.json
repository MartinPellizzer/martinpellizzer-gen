    "intro": "Scorzonella, commonly known as scorzonera, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, many of which are native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. These plants typically have basal leaves that are often hairy and rosette-like, with small, yellow or white flowers arranged in compact clusters. Scorzonella species are often found in dry, rocky or sandy soils, and some are cultivated for their edible roots or as ornamental plants. The genus is also noted for its ability to thrive in harsh environments, making it a hardy choice for certain garden settings."
