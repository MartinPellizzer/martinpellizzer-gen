    "intro": "Stewartia cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf stewartia, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, heart-shaped leaves that turn vibrant yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, followed by ornamental red or orange capsules. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its slow growth and long lifespan make it a valuable addition to gardens and natural habitats."
