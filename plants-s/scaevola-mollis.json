It is a low-growing shrub with soft, hairy stems and small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions. Its flowers are typically borne in clusters and bloom throughout the growing season. Scaevola mollis is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
