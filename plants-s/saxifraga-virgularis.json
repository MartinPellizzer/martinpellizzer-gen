    "intro": "Saxifraga virgularis, commonly known as the common saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or mountainous regions. The plant features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wool. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and are arranged in a raceme, blooming in late spring to early summer. Saxifraga virgularis is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
