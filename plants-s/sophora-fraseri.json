    "intro": "Sophora fraseri, commonly known as the Chinese wisteria, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often have a feathery appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, blue to purple pea-like flowers in the spring, which are followed by long, narrow pods. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal. However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seedlings."
