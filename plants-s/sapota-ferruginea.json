    "intro": "Sapota ferruginea, commonly known as the red sapote, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America and the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pale yellow flowers. The fruit is typically round, with a thick, leathery rind that turns from green to reddish-brown as it matures. The pulp is creamy, sweet, and starchy, with a flavor reminiscent of a mix between a banana and a pear. It is valued for its edible fruit and is often cultivated for both local consumption and commercial purposes."
