    "intro": "Sinapis communis, commonly known as mustard, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and alternate, pinnately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by pods containing several seeds. Mustard is known for its pungent odor and is widely cultivated for its seeds and as a condiment. It is also an important plant in agricultural systems due to its role in crop rotation and pest management."
