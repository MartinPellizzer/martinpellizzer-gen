    "intro": "Schizotheca hemprichii, commonly known as the horned morning glory, is a tropical climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like protrusions on its leaves and stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, orange-red fruit that splits open when mature. Schizotheca hemprichii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
