It features a mat-forming growth habit with gray-green, hairy leaves that are often curled or twisted. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, bristly, sericocarpous fruits. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
