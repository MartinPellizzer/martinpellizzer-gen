    "intro": "Solanum guianense, commonly known as the Guianese nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and hairy leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet, followed by berries that are typically yellow or red when ripe. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along riverbanks. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for human consumption but has been used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities."
