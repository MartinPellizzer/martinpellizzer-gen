It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant features narrow, silver-blue foliage that is often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its salt tolerance allows it to flourish in harsh, maritime environments."
