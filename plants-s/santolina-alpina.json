    "intro": "Santolina alpina, commonly known as alpine santolina, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features silver-gray, aromatic foliage that is densely packed and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in compact, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine displays. Santolina alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in colder climates."
