    "intro": "Stawellia, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their thick, fleshy leaves and showy, tubular flowers. Stawellia species typically grow as succulents, storing water in their leaves to survive in arid environments. They thrive in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making them popular houseplants. The flowers come in a variety of colors, including purple, pink, and white, adding ornamental value to gardens and indoor spaces."
