    "intro": "Senecio congestus var. palustris, commonly known as the swamp senecio, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, cone-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate periodic flooding. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
