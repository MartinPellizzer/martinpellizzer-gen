    "intro": "Sarothamnus gaditanus, commonly known as the Spanish thorn, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, often in Mediterranean climates. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Sarothamnus gaditanus is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range."
