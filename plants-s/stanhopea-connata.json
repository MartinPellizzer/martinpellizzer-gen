    "intro": "Stanhopea connata, commonly known as the Cinnamon Orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that bloom in a striking shade of pink or red. The plant produces a distinctive cinnamon-scented fragrance, which is particularly noticeable when the flowers open in the evening. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, forming a basal rosette that helps it thrive in shaded, humid environments. Stanhopea connata is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its unique aromatic properties."
