    "intro": "Sedum triactina subsp. leptum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and linear, fleshy leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid climates."
