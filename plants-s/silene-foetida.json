    "intro": "Silene foetida, commonly known as stinking silene, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in late summer. It is characterized by its strong, unpleasant odor, which is thought to attract specific pollinators. Silene foetida is often found in open, sun-exposed habitats and is adapted to cold climates."
