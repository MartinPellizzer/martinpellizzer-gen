    "intro": "Solanum dispar, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by berries that turn from green to yellow or orange as they mature. Solanum dispar contains alkaloids and is toxic to humans and animals, though it is sometimes used in traditional medicine. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in desert environments."
