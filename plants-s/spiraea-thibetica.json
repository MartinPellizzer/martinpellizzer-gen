    "intro": "Spiraea thibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has slender, arching branches and dark green, ovate leaves that turn reddish in the fall. Spiraea thibetica thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cooler, high-altitude environments."
