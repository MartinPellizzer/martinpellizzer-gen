It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fluffy, silver-gray inflorescences that resemble delicate plumes. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
