    "intro": "Styphelia brevistyla, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the wet heathlands of southeastern Australia. It features small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a compact and mat-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight. Styphelia brevistyla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form dense ground cover in suitable habitats."
