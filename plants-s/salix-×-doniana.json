    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 doniana, commonly known as the Weeping Willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the Old World. It is characterized by its long, cascading branches that create a distinctive weeping appearance. The tree produces catkins as its flowers, which are typically male and female, with the female catkins developing into small, soft, fluffy seeds. Its leaves are broad, oval, and often have a serrated edge, turning yellow in the autumn. Salix \u00d7 doniana is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and is often found near water sources."
