    "intro": "Stephanomeria minima, commonly known as the small globemallow, is a small, herbaceous annual plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, gray-green leaves that are covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for arid environments. Stephanomeria minima is often found in coastal dunes and sandy soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing the landscape."
