    "intro": "Saxifraga rigoi, commonly known as the Scottish saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Scotland and northern England. It typically forms dense mats of dark green, hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are characterized by their serrated edges and thick, waxy texture, which help it withstand harsh environmental conditions. Saxifraga rigoi plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is a valued species in horticulture for its ornamental appeal."
