    "intro": "Sorbus austriaca subsp. hazslinszkyana, commonly known as the Hungarian whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Europe. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, greyish bark. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by small, red berries that mature in autumn. Its leaves are elliptical, with a serrated edge, and turn yellow in the fall. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and reforestation projects."
