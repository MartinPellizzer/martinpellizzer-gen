    "intro": "Salix rhododendrifolia, commonly known as the rhododendron willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and clusters of small, delicate flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they turn yellow in the autumn. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in rocky environments."
