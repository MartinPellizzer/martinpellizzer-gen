    "intro": "Stemona jinshajiangensis var. dainbeiensis, commonly known as the Dainbeiensis stemona, is a rare and endemic plant species native to China. It belongs to the family Stemonaceae and is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring. Its medicinal properties are of interest in traditional Chinese medicine, though further research is needed to fully understand its chemical composition. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
