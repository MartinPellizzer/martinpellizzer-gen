    "intro": "Schefflera mellifera, commonly known as the honey-scented umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like clusters of dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that emit a sweet, honey-like scent, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptability to various soil types and moderate watering makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation. The plant's ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and year-round foliage."
