    "intro": "Salvia chudaei var. tefedestica, commonly known as the desert sage, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, woody stems that often branch near the base, forming a low, sprawling shrub. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue to violet in color, arranged in whorled clusters along the stems. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This variety is adapted to extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient and hardy plant suited for xeriscaping."
