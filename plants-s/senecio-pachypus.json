    "intro": "Senecio pachypus, commonly known as the woolly senecio, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant features thick, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate touch to its rugged appearance. Due to its unique texture and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
