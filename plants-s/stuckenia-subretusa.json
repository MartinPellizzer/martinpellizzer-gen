    "intro": "Stuckenia subretusa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are smooth and slightly ribbed, often floating on the water surface or partially submerged. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Stuckenia subretusa plays a role in stabilizing aquatic habitats and providing food for various waterfowl and invertebrates."
