It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its slender stems and violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered with a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and potential medicinal properties."
