    "intro": "Senegalia klugii, commonly known as the Klug's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, thorny foliage and compound leaves that are often reduced to spines. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in cylindrical clusters, which are followed by small, woody pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a hardy species in semi-desert environments. Senegalia klugii is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock."
