    "intro": "Scherya bahiensis, commonly known as the Bahia Scherya, is a species of flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of blue or purple. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its native habitat. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas within tropical forests. Scherya bahiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
