    "intro": "Sebastiania subulata var. virgata, commonly known as the silverleaf sebastiania, is a succulent shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features dense, silver-gray foliage with small, pointed leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
