    "intro": "Sorghum lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sorghum, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, elongated leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a distinctive silver-white underside. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that develop into hard, dry seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Sorghum lanceolatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
