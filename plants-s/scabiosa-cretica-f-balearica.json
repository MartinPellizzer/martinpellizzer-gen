    "intro": "Scabiosa cretica f. balearica, commonly known as the Balearic scabious, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features basal leaves that are typically lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, while the upper leaves are smaller and more rounded. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers arranged in a spherical inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
