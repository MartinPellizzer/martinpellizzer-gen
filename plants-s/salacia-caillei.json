    "intro": "Salacia caillei, commonly known as the Caillei salacia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Salaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Salacia caillei is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
