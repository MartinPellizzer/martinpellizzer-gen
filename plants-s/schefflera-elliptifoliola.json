    "intro": "Schefflera elliptifoliola, commonly known as the narrow-leaf umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, rounded canopy with multiple stems that bear large, palmate leaves with elliptical lobes. The leaves are typically dark green and glossy, providing an ornamental appearance suitable for indoor cultivation. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by black berries, though these are not typically consumed by humans. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate watering to maintain its health and appearance."
