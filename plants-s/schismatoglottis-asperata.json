    "intro": "Schismatoglottis asperata, commonly known as the roughleaf schismatoglottis, is a species of flowering plant in the family Orchidaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its strap-like, dark green leaves with a rough texture, which give it its common name. It produces small, pale greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Schismatoglottis asperata is typically grown as a houseplant due to its compact size and ornamental foliage."
