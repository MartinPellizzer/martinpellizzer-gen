    "intro": "Saltzwedelia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's botanical features include long, slender leaves and a single, delicate flower with a distinctive white and green coloration. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom. Due to its rarity and ecological sensitivity, it is listed as endangered in several states."
