    "intro": "Stipagrostis lanata, commonly known as the woolly grass, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy foliage, which gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Stipagrostis lanata is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
