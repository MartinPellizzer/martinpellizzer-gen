It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. This variant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, where it thrives in full sun. Its botanical features make it a hardy and adaptable species within the genus Scleranthus."
