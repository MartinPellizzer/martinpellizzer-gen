It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments on the island of Maui. It has distinctive lobed leaves and produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
