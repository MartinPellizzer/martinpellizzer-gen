It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a faintly fragrant aroma. The plant has a dense, compact growth habit with silvery-white, fuzzy foliage that gives it its common name. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The bark is smooth and gray, and the leaves are opposite, ovate, and glossy."
