    "intro": "Stipa setacea, commonly known as silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and fine, silky hairs that cover the leaves and inflorescence. The plant produces dense, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to golden florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is cultivated in gardens and used for erosion control."
