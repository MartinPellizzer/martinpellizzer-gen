    "intro": "Schoenus lepidosperma subsp. lepidosperma, commonly known as the coastal flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in dune environments or on rocky shores. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which help stabilize coastal soils. It is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic inundation, making it an important component of coastal vegetation."
