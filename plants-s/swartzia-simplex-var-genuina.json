    "intro": "Swartzia simplex var. genuina, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and striking, often fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish-green fruits that contain flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its rarity and high value, it is also considered an endangered species."
