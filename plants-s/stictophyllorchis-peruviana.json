    "intro": "Stictophyllorchis peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian leafless orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its modified stems. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming during the dry season. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and moderate humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
