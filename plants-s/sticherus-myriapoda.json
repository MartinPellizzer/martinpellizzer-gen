    "intro": "Sticherus myriapoda, commonly known as the many-footed moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a central axis and lateral branches, and its leaves are small, ovate, and arranged in a spiral pattern. Sticherus myriapoda plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions."
