The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist, acidic soils. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and flies. The species is known for its graceful appearance and is often found in natural habitats across the eastern United States."
