    "intro": "Salix geyeriana, commonly known as Geyer's willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and grayish bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and small, inconspicuous flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Geyer's willow thrives in harsh, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates."
