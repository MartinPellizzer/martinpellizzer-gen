    "intro": "Saponaria parvula, commonly known as the small-flowered soapwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers in early summer. The plant is characterized by its milky sap, which is mildly soapy and can be used for cleansing purposes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Saponaria parvula is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal remedies."
