    "intro": "Stevia ophiomaches, commonly known as the red stevia, is a perennial herb native to South America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, red flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are often used as a natural sweetener due to their high steviol glycoside content. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for cultivation in warm climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant flowers and medicinal properties."
