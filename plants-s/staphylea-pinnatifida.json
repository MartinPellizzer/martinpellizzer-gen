It features compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by elongated, bean-like fruits. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological studies and ornamental gardening. The plant prefers well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats."
