    "intro": "Solanum aculeatum var. fuertesii, commonly known as the Fuertes' nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and leaves, which are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for cultivation and is more commonly encountered in the wild."
