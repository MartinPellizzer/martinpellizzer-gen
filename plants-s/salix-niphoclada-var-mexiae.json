    "intro": "Salix niphoclada var. mexiae, commonly known as the Mexican willow, is a shrub or small tree native to high-altitude regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of white or gray pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, typical of willow species, with both male and female flowers. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
