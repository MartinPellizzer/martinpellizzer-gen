    "intro": "Striga pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf witchweed, is a parasitic plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses and other crops. The plant is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and slender, branching stems. It is native to Africa and is considered a significant weed in agricultural systems due to its ability to weaken and even kill its host. Its life cycle involves producing large numbers of tiny seeds that can remain viable in the soil for years."
