    "intro": "Skoliopteris, commonly known as the giant horsetail, is a prehistoric plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae. It was a tall, herbaceous plant that thrived during the Carboniferous and Permian periods. Skoliopteris had a distinctive, segmented stem with whorls of leaves and a central, hollow axis. Its structure suggests it was adapted for efficient water transport and possibly for supporting heavy spore-producing structures. Fossil records show it played a significant role in the early evolution of vascular plants."
