    "intro": "Salix cordata angustata, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 2 inches wide. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it blooms in early spring. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, and it often grows along stream banks and wetlands. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
