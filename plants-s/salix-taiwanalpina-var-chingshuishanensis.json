    "intro": "Salix taiwanalpina var. chingshuishanensis, commonly known as the Chingshuishan willow, is a rare and endemic species native to Taiwan. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant features slender branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. Its flowers are small and catkin-like, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. This willow is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution."
