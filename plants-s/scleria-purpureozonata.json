It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flower heads. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are usually green or brown, and it produces small, three-angled berries. Scleria purpureozonata is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, contributing to the ecological diversity of wetland habitats."
