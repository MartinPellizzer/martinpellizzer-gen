    "intro": "Seriola, commonly known as the yellowfin tuna, is a marine fish rather than a plant, so it does not have botanical aspects. However, if you were referring to a plant with a similar name, please clarify. If you meant a different species, kindly provide more context. In its true botanical sense, Seriola is not a plant and therefore lacks leaves, roots, or flowers. It is important to distinguish between botanical and zoological classifications when discussing biological organisms."
