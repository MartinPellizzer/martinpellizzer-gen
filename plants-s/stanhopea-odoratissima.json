    "intro": "Stanhopea odoratissima, commonly known as the fragrant stanhopea, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow with red or purple markings. The plant produces its flowers on a tall, erect stem, often reaching heights of up to two meters. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures rather than in soil. The orchid is prized for its strong, sweet fragrance, which is most noticeable when the flowers are in full bloom."
