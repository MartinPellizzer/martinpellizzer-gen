    "intro": "Smilax herbacea var. flaccida, commonly known as the soft-stemmed smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, often hairy stems that are typically more flexible than those of other smilax species. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a distinctive waxy texture. This variety is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and thickets."
