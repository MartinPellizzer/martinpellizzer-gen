    "intro": "Senegalia monacantha, commonly known as screwbean, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its twisted, often thorny stems and small, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its leaves are typically small and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration. Senegalia monacantha is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in degraded lands."
