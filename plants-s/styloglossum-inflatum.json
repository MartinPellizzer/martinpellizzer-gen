    "intro": "Styloglossum inflatum, commonly known as the inflated bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in tropical regions. It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant's leaves are modified into specialized bladders that function as passive traps, relying on water currents to bring prey into them. Styloglossum inflatum lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its bladders and rhizomes. It plays a unique role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling microfauna populations and contributing to nutrient cycling."
