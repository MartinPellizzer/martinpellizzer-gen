    "intro": "Sabina mucronata, commonly known as the Mexican juniper, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and small, dark blue berries. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its foliage provides habitat for various wildlife, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Sabina mucronata is also valued for its aromatic wood, which has been used traditionally in crafts and medicine."
