It is a terrestrial herb with a short, rhizomatous stem and produces small, pale green to white flowers arranged in a dense inflorescence. The leaves are typically broad, elliptical, and have a smooth texture with a waxy surface. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This plant is often grown as an ornamental due to its unique floral structure and foliage."
