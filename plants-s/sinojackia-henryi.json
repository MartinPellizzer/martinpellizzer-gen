It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its slender, gray-barked trunk and alternate, simple leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
