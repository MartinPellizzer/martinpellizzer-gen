    "intro": "Sphedamnocarpus fallax, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Sphedamnocarpus fallax is often found in wetlands and along the edges of streams, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and supporting local wildlife."
