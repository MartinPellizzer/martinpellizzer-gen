    "intro": "Sciaphila consimilis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition, hence its common name. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Sciaphila consimilis is considered a critically endangered species."
