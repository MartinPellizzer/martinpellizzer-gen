    "intro": "Stipa compacta, commonly known as needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open grasslands, meadows, and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, needle-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. Its flowering stems bear loose panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically green to brown in hue. Stipa compacta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
