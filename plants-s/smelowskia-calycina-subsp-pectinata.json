    "intro": "Smelowskia calycina subsp. pectinata, commonly known as the pectinate smelowskia, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive pectinate (comb-like) leaf margins, which give it its subspecific name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or mountainous regions. Its flowers are small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
