    "intro": "Sisymbrium niveum, commonly known as the hoary broomrape, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are reduced to scale-like structures, and it lacks true stems, making it appear as a cluster of flowering shoots. Sisymbrium niveum is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, contributing to the ecological dynamics of its environment."
