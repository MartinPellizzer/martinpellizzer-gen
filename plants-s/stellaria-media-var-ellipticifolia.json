    "intro": "Stellaria media var. ellipticifolia, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers with five petals arranged in a star-like pattern, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. The leaves are elliptical and often covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a distinctive texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along paths. This variant is closely related to the more common Stellaria media, but differs in leaf shape and habitat preference."
