    "intro": "Stera \u00d7 microphylla, commonly known as the hybrid boxwood, is a popular ornamental plant valued for its dense, evergreen foliage. It is a hybrid between *Buxus sempervirens* and *Buxus microphylla*, resulting in a compact, slow-growing shrub. The leaves are typically small, oval, and have a smooth, glossy texture, contributing to its aesthetic appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for hedges and topiaries. Due to its hardiness and ease of maintenance, it is widely cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
