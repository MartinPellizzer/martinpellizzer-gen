    "intro": "Salsola baccifera, commonly known as Russian thorn or lamb's quarters, is a halophytic shrub belonging to the Amaranthaceae family. It is native to temperate and arid regions of Eurasia and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, red berries that are edible and often consumed by wildlife and humans. Salsola baccifera thrives in saline soils and is often found in coastal areas, deserts, and disturbed sites. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it an important component of ecological restoration projects."
