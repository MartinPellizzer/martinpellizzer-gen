    "intro": "Stirlingia affinis, commonly known as the slender sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and greyish, often exfoliating to reveal a lighter inner layer. Stirlingia affinis is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes."
