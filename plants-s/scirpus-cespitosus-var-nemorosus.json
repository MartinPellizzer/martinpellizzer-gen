    "intro": "Scirpus cespitosus var. nemorosus, commonly known as the swamp reed or northern bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, and it produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown flowers. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to the plant's ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments. This variant is distinguished by its dense growth habit and preference for cooler, northern climates compared to other Scirpus species."
