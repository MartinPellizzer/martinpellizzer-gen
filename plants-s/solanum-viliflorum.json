    "intro": "Solanum viliflorum, commonly known as the silky nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, somewhat fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, blooming in the spring and early summer. Its berries, which are toxic to humans and animals, are typically yellow or orange when ripe. Solanum viliflorum is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along stream banks."
