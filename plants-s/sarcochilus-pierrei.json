    "intro": "Sarcochilus pierrei, commonly known as the Orange-veined Sword Fern, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its long, arching, sword-shaped leaves that are typically green with distinct orange veins. The plant produces striking orange-red flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in racemes. Sarcochilus pierrei thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-drained, humus-rich soil. It is a relatively slow-growing plant that is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique foliage."
