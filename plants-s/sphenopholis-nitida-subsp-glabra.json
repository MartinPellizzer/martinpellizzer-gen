    "intro": "Sphenopholis nitida subsp. glabra, commonly known as the smooth sphenopholis, is a species of fern native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are typically glabrous, or smooth to the touch. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Its leaves are usually lanceolate in shape and exhibit a delicate, feathery appearance. This species is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky crevices."
