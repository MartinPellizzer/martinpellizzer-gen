It typically grows in shallow water, wetlands, and marshes, often forming dense underwater stands. The plant has narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots anchor in the substrate. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value to aquatic environments. This variety is valued for its ecological role in water filtration and as a habitat for aquatic life."
