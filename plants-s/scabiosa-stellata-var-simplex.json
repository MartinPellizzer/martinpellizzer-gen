It is characterized by its clusters of small, star-shaped pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic when crushed. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and rock gardens. Scabiosa stellata var. simplex is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
