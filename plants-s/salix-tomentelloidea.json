    "intro": "Salix tomentelloidea, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its grayish-white, fuzzy bark and slender, drooping branches. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hair, giving the plant its common name. It produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typically greenish-yellow in color. This species is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in mountainous regions where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
