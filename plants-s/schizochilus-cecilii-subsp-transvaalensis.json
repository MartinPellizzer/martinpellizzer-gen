    "intro": "Schizochilus cecilii subsp. transvaalensis, commonly known as the Transvaal orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to South Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, hairy foliage and striking, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in areas with high humidity and partial shade. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinctive lip that is often darker and more prominent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
