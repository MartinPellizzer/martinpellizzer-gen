    "intro": "Sonchus nanus, commonly known as the mouse-ear chickweed, is a small annual herb belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a single head, followed by bristly, oval-shaped seeds. It is native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and is often found in disturbed soils, fields, and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a common weed in many agricultural and urban environments."
