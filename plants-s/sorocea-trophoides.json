    "intro": "Sorocea trophoides, commonly known as the dwarf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow waters and has delicate, branched stems with small, scale-like leaves. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the food web and maintaining water quality. Due to its specialized adaptations, it is considered an indicator species for healthy wetland environments."
