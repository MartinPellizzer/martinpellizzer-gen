    "intro": "Seseli tortuosum var. brachylobum, commonly known as the short-stalked seseli, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, compound umbels of white to pale green flowers. The leaves are typically pinnately divided, with a basal rosette structure that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. This variety is native to western North America, particularly found in dry, rocky habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
