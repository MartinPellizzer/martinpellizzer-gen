    "intro": "Sedum rhodiola var. involucratum, commonly known as the Rosy Stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to rocky and arid environments in the Mediterranean region. It features fleshy, upright stems covered in small, rounded leaves that are often tinged with red or purple hues. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. This variety is valued in rock gardens and xeriscaping for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
