    "intro": "Sacoila pedicellata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in three-winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. Sacoila pedicellata is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
