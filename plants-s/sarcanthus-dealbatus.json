    "intro": "Sarcanthus dealbatus, commonly known as the white-flowered sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it has a sprawling growth habit. Sarcanthus dealbatus is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
