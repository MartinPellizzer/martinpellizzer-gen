It is characterized by its distinctive pentagonal shape and vibrant blue or purple flowers. The plant has a short, compact growth habit with a fleshy, succulent stem. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its saline environment. Sicyocaulis pentagonus plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
