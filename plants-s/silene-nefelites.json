    "intro": "Silene nefelites, commonly known as the cloud silene, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Silene nefelites is considered a rare and endangered species."
