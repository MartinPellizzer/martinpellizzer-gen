    "intro": "Schoenus coronatus, commonly known as the crowned sedge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, giving it the appearance of a crown, hence its common name. Schoenus coronatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
