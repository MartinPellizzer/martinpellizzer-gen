    "intro": "Stisseria depressa, commonly known as the dwarf stisseria, is a small herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked. Its botanical characteristics include a compact growth habit and a preference for well-drained, acidic soils. Stisseria depressa is generally not cultivated for ornamental purposes but is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological niche."
