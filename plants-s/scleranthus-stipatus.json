    "intro": "Scleranthus stipatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thornweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are narrow and stipitate, meaning they are attached to the stem by a short, stalk-like base. Scleranthus stipatus is an annual or biennial plant that produces small, yellowish or greenish flowers followed by legume-like pods containing seeds."
