    "intro": "Sabia uropetala, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Sabia uropetala is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions."
