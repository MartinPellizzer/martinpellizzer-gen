    "intro": "Sloanea echinocarpa, commonly known as the spiny sloanea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and distinctive spiny structures. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spiny fruits. Sloanea echinocarpa is often found in humid, lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties. Its hardy nature makes it adaptable to a variety of soil conditions, though it thrives best in well-drained, fertile ground."
