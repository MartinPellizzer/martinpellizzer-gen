    "intro": "Sclerocactus cloverae subsp. brackii, commonly known as the brackii subshrub, is a rare and distinctive cactus native to specific regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its short, compact growth habit and thick, ribbed stems that are typically covered in a dense coating of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered near the top of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
