    "intro": "Spiraea vulgaris, commonly known as meadowsweet, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe, western Asia, and North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring arching stems and clusters of fragrant, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. Its botanical features include small, oval-shaped fruits called achenes, which are enclosed in a persistent calyx. The plant is often found in moist, sunny habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges."
