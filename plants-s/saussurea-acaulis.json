    "intro": "Saussurea acaulis, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white flowers and compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with low precipitation. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a symbol of resilience and purity in many cultures. Due to its ecological significance and aesthetic value, it is also a protected species in several regions."
