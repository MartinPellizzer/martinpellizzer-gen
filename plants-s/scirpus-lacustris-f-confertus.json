    "intro": "Scirpus lacustris f. confertus, commonly known as the broad-leaved bulrush, is a wetland plant characterized by its robust, grass-like foliage. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along riverbanks. The plant features tall, cylindrical flower spikes that emerge from dense, clustered leaves. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The broad, lance-shaped leaves are a distinguishing feature of this botanical form."
