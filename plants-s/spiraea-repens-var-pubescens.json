    "intro": "Spiraea repens var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy willow-spiraea, is a low-growing shrub native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It features spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or ground covers. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves are oval to elliptic, with a hairy texture that gives the variety its name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks."
