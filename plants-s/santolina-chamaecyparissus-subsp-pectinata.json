    "intro": "Santolina chamaecyparissus subsp. pectinata, commonly known as the woolly santolina, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, silver-gray foliage that is densely covered with fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters in the summer, which are borne on short, branched stems. It is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
