    "intro": "Specklinia digitale, commonly known as the digitate fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are divided into numerous small, finger-like segments, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. Specklinia digitale is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ease of care in the right conditions."
