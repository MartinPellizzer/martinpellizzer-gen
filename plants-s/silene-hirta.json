    "intro": "Silene hirta, commonly known as the hairy catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its pink to purple flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain heat in cold environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss. Silene hirta plays a role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
