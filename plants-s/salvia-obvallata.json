    "intro": "Salvia obvallata, commonly known as the basket sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are square, a common trait among the mint family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping. The plant is also valued for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
