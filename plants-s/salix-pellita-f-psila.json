    "intro": "Salix pellita f. psila, commonly known as the silky willow, is a unique variant of the silky willow species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. This plant is characterized by its soft, silky hairs covering the leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive appearance. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a pale green upper surface and a silvery underside. It produces catkins in early spring, which are an important source of pollen for early pollinators."
