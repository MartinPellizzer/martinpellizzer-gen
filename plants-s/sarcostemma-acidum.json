    "intro": "Sarcostemma acidum, commonly known as the sour milk vine, is a climbing shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by bright orange or red berries. Its leaves and fruits contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans. Sarcostemma acidum is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in arid to semi-arid environments."
