    "intro": "Spergula decandra, commonly known as the two-flowered sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as wet meadows and marshes. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that are often greenish or brownish in color. Spergula decandra is characterized by its two distinct flower types within each spikelet, which is a notable botanical feature. It plays a role in supporting local insect populations and is often found in riparian zones."
