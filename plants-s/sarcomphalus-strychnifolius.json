    "intro": "Sarcomphalus strychnifolius, commonly known as the poisonwood plant, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are often arranged in opposite pairs along the stem. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, red berries containing toxic seeds. Its leaves contain toxic compounds, including strychnine, which can be harmful to humans and animals. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in traditional medicine and landscaping."
