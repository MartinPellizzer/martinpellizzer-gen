It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plants typically grow as herbaceous perennials, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Staudtia species produce bulbs that store nutrients, allowing them to survive dry periods. Their foliage consists of broad, strap-like leaves that are often used in ornamental gardening."
