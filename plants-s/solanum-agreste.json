    "intro": "Solanum agreste, commonly known as the wild tomato or small-fruited nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like potatoes and peppers. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its small, yellowish flowers give way to berries that contain seeds, which can be dispersed by animals. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits, though its toxicity requires caution."
