    "intro": "Stipa conferta, commonly known as the dense fescue, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, awned spikelets. Stipa conferta thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and rocky areas. Its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions makes it a hardy and resilient species."
