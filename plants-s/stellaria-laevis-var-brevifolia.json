    "intro": "Stellaria laevis var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. The leaves are smooth and often covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a soft, velvety texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its shorter leaf blades compared to the typical form of Stellaria laevis."
