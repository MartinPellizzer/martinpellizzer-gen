    "intro": "Stipa \u00d7 consanguinea, commonly known as the hybrid wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Stipa capillata and Stipa pennata, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often used in ornamental gardening. It is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for erosion control and wildlife habitats. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a model for studying polyploidy and hybridization in grasses."
