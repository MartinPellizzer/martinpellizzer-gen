    "intro": "Stevia crassifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian stevia, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is known for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, which are naturally occurring sweeteners. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in warm climates. Stevia crassifolia is often used as a sugar substitute due to its intense sweetness and low caloric content."
