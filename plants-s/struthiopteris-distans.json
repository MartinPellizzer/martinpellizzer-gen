    "intro": "Struthiopteris distans, commonly known as the broad-leafed field fern, is a species of fern native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced in sori that are arranged along the margins of the fronds. The plant plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various small organisms."
