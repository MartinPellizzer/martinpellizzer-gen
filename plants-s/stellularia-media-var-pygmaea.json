    "intro": "Stellularia media var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and marshes in the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically 2\u20135 inches in diameter, with a glossy green surface and a distinct veining pattern. The plant produces small, white, arrowhead-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, ditches, and along the edges of ponds. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for wetland gardens and water feature landscapes."
