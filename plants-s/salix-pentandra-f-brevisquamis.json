    "intro": "Salix pentandra f. brevisquamis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a hybrid willow species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the parent species. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers, which are typical of willow species and are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in moist environments such as riverbanks and wet meadows, where it can form dense stands. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
