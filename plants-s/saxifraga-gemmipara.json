    "intro": "Saxifraga gemmipara, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky environments. It features a mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often colonizing rocky crevices and mountain slopes. Saxifraga gemmipara reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation via gemmae, which are tiny, self-contained plantlets that detach and grow into new individuals."
