It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant typically grows in dry to semi-deciduous forests and has smooth, greyish bark that becomes fissured with age. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous, clustered in spikes. Sideroxylon bodinieri is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its ecological importance as a habitat for various wildlife species."
