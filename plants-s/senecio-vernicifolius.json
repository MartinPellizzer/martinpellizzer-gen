    "intro": "Senecio vernicifolius, commonly known as the sticky weed or yellow pincushion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and milky sap. The plant has hairy, alternate leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, which can be a defense mechanism against herbivores. It produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions outside its native range."
