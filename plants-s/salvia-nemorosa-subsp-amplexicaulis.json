It features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that often have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces showy violet to purple flowers in whorled clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
