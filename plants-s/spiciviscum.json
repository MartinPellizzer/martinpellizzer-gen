It is characterized by its branched, spiny stems and small, greenish flowers that appear in umbel-like clusters. The plant is native to regions of Europe and Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Spiciviscum has a fibrous root system and produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its botanical features make it a common but often overlooked species in temperate climates."
