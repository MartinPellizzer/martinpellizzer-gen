    "intro": "Styphelia esquamata, commonly known as the scaly stylewort, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its small, needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, scaly texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers during the spring and summer months. Styphelia esquamata thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. It is often found in heathlands and is an important component of the local flora in its native habitat."
