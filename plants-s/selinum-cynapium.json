    "intro": "Selinum cynapium, commonly known as hemlock or poison hemlock, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters called umbels. It contains toxic compounds such as cicutoxin and \u03b3-conotoxin, which can be harmful to humans and animals. Due to its toxicity, it is often considered a weed and requires careful handling."
