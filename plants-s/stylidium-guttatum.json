    "intro": "Stylidium guttatum, commonly known as the glandular triggerplant, is a small flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Haemodoraceae and is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers. The plant has a unique mechanism for pollination, where the spurred petals fold inward when touched, triggering the release of pollen. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Stylidium guttatum is a short-lived perennial, often flowering in spring and early summer."
