It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and distinctive purple tints on its leaves and inflorescence. The plant is native to warm temperate and subtropical regions and thrives in well-drained soils. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are typically shorter and more robust compared to the standard variety. This variant is often found in disturbed areas and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
