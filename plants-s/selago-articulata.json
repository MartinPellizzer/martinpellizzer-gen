    "intro": "Selago articulata, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. Its stems are often segmented, giving it a unique, almost architectural appearance. Selago articulata is well adapted to salty air and sandy soils, making it a hardy plant for coastal gardens."
