It features dense clusters of small, blue-gray leaves that are fleshy and adapted to store water. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of blue and purple during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for landscaping in dry climates."
