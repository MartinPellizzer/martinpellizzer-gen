It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh, cold climates. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
