    "intro": "Saxifraga foliosa, commonly known as the leafy saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or coastal environments. Saxifraga foliosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to flourish in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
