    "intro": "Spaniopappus ekmanii, commonly known as the Swedish dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Scandinavia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of many tiny florets. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with a distinctive white pappus that aids in wind dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
