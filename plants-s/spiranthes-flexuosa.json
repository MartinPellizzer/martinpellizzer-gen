    "intro": "Spiranthes flexuosa, commonly known as the twisted lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its spiral arrangement of pale green to white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, and it has strap-like leaves that are often shorter than the flower spikes. The species is known for its delicate appearance and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
