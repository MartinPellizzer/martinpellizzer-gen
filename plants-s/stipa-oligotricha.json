    "intro": "Stipa oligotricha, commonly known as the slender needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including drought and poor soil, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Stipa oligotricha plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for grazing animals."
