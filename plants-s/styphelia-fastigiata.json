    "intro": "Styphelia fastigiata, commonly known as the dwarf snowbank heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. The plant features dense clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that are dark green and evergreen throughout the year. Styphelia fastigiata is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
