    "intro": "Spiraea salicifolia var. undulata, commonly known as the meadow spiraea, is a flowering shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are elliptical, serrated, and have a slightly undulating edge, giving the plant its varietal name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, stream banks, and meadows. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
