    "intro": "Suaeda pallasiana, commonly known as the saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and saline environments. It thrives in coastal and inland saline soils, exhibiting remarkable salt tolerance due to its specialized adaptations. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that reduce water loss and aid in salt excretion. Its yellow flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Suaeda pallasiana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing soil erosion."
