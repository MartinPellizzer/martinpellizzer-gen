    "intro": "Salix tetradenia, commonly known as the four-veined willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its distinctive leaves that have four prominent veins. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Salix tetradenia is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
