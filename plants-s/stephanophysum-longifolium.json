    "intro": "Stephanophysum longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved stephanophysum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the Gulf Coast regions. The plant is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
