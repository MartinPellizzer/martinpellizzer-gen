It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Sandemania glandulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
