    "intro": "Stemodia anisata, commonly known as the narrowleaf stemodia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that are often branched and covered in fine hairs. The leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy surface, and they are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
