    "intro": "Smilax pubens, commonly known as the rough-stemmed catbrier, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in stiff, backward-pointing spines and its compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. Smilax pubens thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to soil stabilization."
