    "intro": "Saussurea obvallata var. gymnocephala, commonly known as the naked-headed fleabane, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact, woolly appearance with dark green, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish composite flowers arranged in a rounded inflorescence. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its reduced, nearly hairless flower head."
