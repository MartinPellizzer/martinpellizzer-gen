    "intro": "Stipa pugionata, commonly known as the sword grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread across dry, open habitats. Stipa pugionata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common sight in rocky or sandy environments. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
