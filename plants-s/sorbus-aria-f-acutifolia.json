    "intro": "Sorbus aria f. acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaved whitebeam, is a cultivar of the whitebeam tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its finely serrated, narrow leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by white, apple-like berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to adapt to various environmental conditions."
