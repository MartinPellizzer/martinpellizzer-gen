    "intro": "Swartzia flaemingii var. psilonema, commonly known as the narrow-leaf swartzia, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody pods containing flat, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation projects."
