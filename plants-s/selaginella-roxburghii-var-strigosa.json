It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobila, which contain spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. This variety is notable for its ability to survive in arid conditions due to its adaptive features."
