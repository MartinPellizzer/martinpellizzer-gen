    "intro": "Sagina saginoides var. nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial herb native to the western United States. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or desert regions. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
