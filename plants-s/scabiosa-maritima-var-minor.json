    "intro": "Scabiosa maritima var. minor, commonly known as the lesser sea holly, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It features wiry, branching stems that are often covered in a fine layer of white, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a similar silvery coating, which helps reduce water loss in coastal environments. This variety is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of salt marshes."
