    "intro": "Sticherus hastulatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sticherus, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its closely appressed, greenish to reddish thallus that forms dense mats on rocky or sandy substrates. The plant has a distinct, leaf-like structure with a short, stout costa and a narrow, elongated lamina. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its small size and specialized habitat, it is often overlooked but plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem."
