    "intro": "Siderocarpos, commonly known as the ironwood tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plants typically grow in tropical and subtropical regions, often in dry or rocky soils. Siderocarpos species have simple, alternate leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers. The fruits are usually capsules that release seeds when mature, contributing to the plant's reproductive strategy."
