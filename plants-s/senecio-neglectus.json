    "intro": "Senecio neglectus, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with narrow, linear leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its succulent stems and reduced leaf surface. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads. Senecio neglectus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
