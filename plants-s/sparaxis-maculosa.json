    "intro": "Sparaxis maculosa, commonly known as the spotted sparaxis, is a striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with distinctive spots or markings. The plant produces a basal rosette of linear, grass-like leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid conditions. It blooms in spring, adding vibrant color to gardens and natural landscapes. Sparaxis maculosa is well-suited for rock gardens and dry climates due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
