It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with parallel veins, giving it its specific epithet. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by orange-red berries containing the seeds. The plant has limited economic importance but is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences."
