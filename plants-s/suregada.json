    "intro": "Suregada, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, erect stalks rising from water. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, aiding in photosynthesis. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the aquatic environment. Suregada is also notable for its cultural and spiritual significance in various Asian traditions."
