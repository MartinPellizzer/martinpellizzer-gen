    "intro": "Struthanthus orinocensis, commonly known as the Orinoco struthanthus, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Venezuela and Colombia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
