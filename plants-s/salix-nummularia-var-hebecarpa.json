    "intro": "Salix nummularia var. hebecarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow or creeping willow, is a low-growing shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter, giving it a dense, mat-like appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary floral structures, and it is often found in moist, rocky or sandy soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is adapted to cold climates. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in ecological studies of alpine ecosystems."
