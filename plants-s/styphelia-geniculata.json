    "intro": "Styphelia geniculata, commonly known as the pink rock heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and densely packed, giving it a compact appearance. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathland and coastal scrub environments. Styphelia geniculata is adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
