    "intro": "Sida littoralis, commonly known as coastal sida, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in saline or brackish environments, such as salt marshes and dunes. The plant has small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs. Sida littoralis is adapted to withstand high salinity and wind exposure, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms."
