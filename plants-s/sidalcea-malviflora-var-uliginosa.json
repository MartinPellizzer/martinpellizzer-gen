It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain lens-shaped seeds. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along stream banks. This variety is adapted to wet conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment."
