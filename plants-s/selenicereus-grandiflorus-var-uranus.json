    "intro": "Selenicereus grandiflorus var. uranus, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a flowering cactus species native to Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that bloom at night, typically in shades of white, yellow, or pink. The plant has a unique structure, with a brightly colored upper portion known as the \"pseudostem\" and a green, photosynthetic base called the \"gastropod.\" It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its striking appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
