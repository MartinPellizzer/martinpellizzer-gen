    "intro": "Soldanella alpina var. uniflora, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features a dense rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve moisture in cold, harsh environments. The plant produces a single, showy white or pale pink flower per stem, which blooms in early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous areas with poor soil conditions. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and delicate species."
