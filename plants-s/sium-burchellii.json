    "intro": "Sium burchellii, commonly known as the broadleaf watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption from water. Sium burchellii is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
