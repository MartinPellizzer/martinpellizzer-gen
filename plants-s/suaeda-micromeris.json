    "intro": "Suaeda micromeris, commonly known as sea blite, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and arid regions where it tolerates high salinity. Its small, green flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, smooth seeds. Suaeda micromeris plays a role in stabilizing soil in saline habitats and is sometimes used in phytoremediation efforts."
