    "intro": "Senecio alpivagus, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Senecio alpivagus produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
