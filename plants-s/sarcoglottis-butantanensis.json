    "intro": "Sarcoglottis butantanensis, commonly known as the Butantan arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
