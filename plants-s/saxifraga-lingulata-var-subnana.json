    "intro": "Saxifraga lingulata var. subnana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous areas with full sun exposure. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shaded, moist environments."
