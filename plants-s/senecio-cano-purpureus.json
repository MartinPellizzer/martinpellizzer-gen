It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, with hairy, often purple-tinged stems and narrow, gray-green leaves. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to drought and poor soil conditions."
