    "intro": "Solanum garciae, commonly known as the Garcia's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or white. The plant produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its restricted distribution and limited research, it remains a relatively obscure species within the Solanum genus."
