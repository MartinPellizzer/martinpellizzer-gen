    "intro": "Syzygium siderocola, commonly known as the ironwood tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant typically grows as a medium to large tree, reaching heights of up to 30 meters, with a broad, spreading canopy. Its leaves are glossy, elliptical, and arranged alternately along the branches. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by edible, sweet-sour red berries that attract various wildlife."
