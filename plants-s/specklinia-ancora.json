    "intro": "Specklinia ancora, commonly known as the speckled orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically greenish-white with purple or brown markings. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Specklinia ancora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
