    "intro": "Stigmaphyllon mathiasiae, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or white. The plant produces small, edible fruits that resemble starfruits, though they are not related to the common starfruit (Carambola). Its foliage consists of palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and it thrives in humid, tropical environments. Stigmaphyllon mathiasiae is often found in secondary forests and is valued for its ornamental and potential medicinal properties."
