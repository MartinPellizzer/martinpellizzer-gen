    "intro": "Sutera albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered sutera, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Sutera albiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
