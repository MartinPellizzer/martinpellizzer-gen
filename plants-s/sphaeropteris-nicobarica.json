    "intro": "Sphaeropteris nicobarica, commonly known as the Nicobar cycad, is a perennial plant native to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones for reproduction. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as thatching material. The species is also valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
