    "intro": "Spiranthes lanceolata var. luteoalba, commonly known as the yellow twayblade, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its unique spiral arrangement of flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its flowers are pale yellow to white and bloom in late spring to early summer. The species is notable for its lack of leaves during the flowering season, relying instead on its rhizomes for photosynthesis."
