    "intro": "Solanum petrophilum, commonly known as the rock nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its toxic properties, it is not recommended for consumption or cultivation in gardens."
