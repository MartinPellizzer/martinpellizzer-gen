    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos larutensis, commonly known as the Larut starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Malaysia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has small, elliptical leaves with a smooth texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
