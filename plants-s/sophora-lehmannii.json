    "intro": "Sophora lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's Sophora, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged and have a distinctive silvery-white underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. The plant has been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for its medicinal properties."
