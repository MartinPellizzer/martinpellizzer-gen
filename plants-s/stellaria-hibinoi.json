    "intro": "Stellaria hibinoi, commonly known as Hibino's starwort, is a rare flowering plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, white star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and often prostrate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
