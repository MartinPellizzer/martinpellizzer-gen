    "intro": "Sphenostigma caelestinum, commonly known as the celestial sphenostigma, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its vibrant blue and purple foliage, which reflects its unique adaptation to low-light conditions. The plant's leaves are thick and waxy, helping it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are small but vivid, often appearing in clusters. Due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal, it is highly sought after by botanists and plant enthusiasts alike."
