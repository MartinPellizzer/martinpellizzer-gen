    "intro": "Selaginella martensii var. compacta, commonly known as the compact spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to the southeastern United States. It has a rosette-like structure with dense, scale-like leaves that form a tight, compact appearance. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the reproductive organs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and ability to retain moisture make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
