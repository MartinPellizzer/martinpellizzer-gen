    "intro": "Sieruela stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broom, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features woody stems that are typically straight and upright, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture. Sieruela stricta is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats."
