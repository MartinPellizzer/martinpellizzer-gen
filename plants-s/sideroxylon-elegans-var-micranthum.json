    "intro": "Sideroxylon elegans var. micranthum, commonly known as the small-flowered ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thorny branches, which provide structural support and defense against herbivores. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, and it is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually small, leathery, and arranged oppositely on the stems. The species is valued for its ornamental potential and ecological role in stabilizing soils in degraded landscapes."
