    "intro": "Senecio bernardinus var. sparsilobatus, commonly known as the sparse-leaved groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its woolly, gray-green foliage and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and drought tolerance, making it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions."
