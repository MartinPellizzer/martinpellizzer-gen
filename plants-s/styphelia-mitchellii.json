    "intro": "Styphelia mitchellii, commonly known as Mitchell's snowbells, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate floral display to its compact form. The plant has linear, dark green leaves that are densely packed, giving it a dense, cushion-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires partial to full sun exposure. Styphelia mitchellii is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
