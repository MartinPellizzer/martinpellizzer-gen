    "intro": "Scirpus xyridis, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is a tall, perennial grass-like plant that typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish or brownish flowers that appear in late summer. Its roots help stabilize soil and improve water quality by filtering pollutants. Scirpus xyridis plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
