    "intro": "Stethoma pectoralis, commonly known as the chestnut tree, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the autumn. The tree produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, spiny fruits called chestnuts. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. Stethoma pectoralis plays an important ecological role by supporting a variety of wildlife and contributing to forest ecosystems."
