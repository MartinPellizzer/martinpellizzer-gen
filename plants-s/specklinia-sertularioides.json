    "intro": "Specklinia sertularioides, commonly known as the coral fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, whitish coating, giving it a unique appearance. Its rhizomes are short and branched, allowing it to anchor itself to its host. Specklinia sertularioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant."
