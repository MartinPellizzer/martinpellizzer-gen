    "intro": "Siphocampylus lycioides, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, which is a common trait among members of its family. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Siphocampylus lycioides plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
