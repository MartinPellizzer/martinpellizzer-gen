    "intro": "Saxifraga minutissima, commonly known as the minute saxifrage, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in harsh, cold environments. The plant has tiny, clustered leaves and produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It is a member of the Saxifragaceae family, which includes many other hardy, alpine species. Due to its delicate nature, it is often found in high-altitude or polar habitats where competition is minimal."
