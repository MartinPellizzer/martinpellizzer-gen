    "intro": "Sorbus viminalis, commonly known as the whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the autumn. Sorbus viminalis is often found in woodland edges and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
