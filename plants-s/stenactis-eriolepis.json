    "intro": "Stenactis eriolepis, commonly known as the woolly sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Goodeniaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, woolly leaves covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its coastal habitat. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate touch to rocky shores. It thrives in saline environments and is often found in coastal areas of southern Africa. Stenactis eriolepis is adapted to withstand strong winds and salt spray, making it a resilient species in its native range."
