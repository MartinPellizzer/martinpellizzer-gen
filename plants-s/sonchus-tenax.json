    "intro": "Sonchus tenax, commonly known as common beggar's ticks, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its upright stems and rough, hairy leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its seeds are covered in hooked bristles, which allow them to attach to animals and clothing, aiding in seed dispersal. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows."
