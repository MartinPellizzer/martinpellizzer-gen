    "intro": "Solanum bifissum, commonly known as the two-cleft nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant produces small, spherical berries that are green when immature and turn red when ripe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or edible purposes."
