    "intro": "Schefflera bangii, commonly known as the silver star plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Philippines. It features a distinctive, compact growth habit with thick, waxy leaves that have a silvery-white underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schefflera bangii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
