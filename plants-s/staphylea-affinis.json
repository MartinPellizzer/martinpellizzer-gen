    "intro": "Staphylea affinis, commonly known as the European hornbeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by edible, horn-shaped fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats. Staphylea affinis is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
