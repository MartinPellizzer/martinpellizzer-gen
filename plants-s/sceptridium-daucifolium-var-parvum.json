    "intro": "Sceptridium daucifolium var. parvum, commonly known as the small-leaved sandmat, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically features a rosette of narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a dense, spike-like inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots are adapted for anchoring in loose, sandy soils and for efficient water uptake. This species is often found in disturbed areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience."
