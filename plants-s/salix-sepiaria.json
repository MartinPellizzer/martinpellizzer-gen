    "intro": "Salix sepiaria, commonly known as the Japanese willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan and parts of eastern Asia. It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and small, elongated leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its flowers are catkins, which are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, round fruits called samaras. Salix sepiaria is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate urban environments."
