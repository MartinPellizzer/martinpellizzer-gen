    "intro": "Symplocos furcata, commonly known as the forked sandpaper bush, is a deciduous shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, stinging hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemose inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds. Symplocos furcata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions."
