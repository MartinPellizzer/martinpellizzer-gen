    "intro": "Salix ferganensis, commonly known as the Fergana willow, is a shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and streams. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various wildlife."
