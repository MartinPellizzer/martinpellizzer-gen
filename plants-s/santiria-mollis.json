    "intro": "Santiria mollis, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is native to South America, particularly found in the Andes mountains, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically white or pale purple, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the warmer months. Santiria mollis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
