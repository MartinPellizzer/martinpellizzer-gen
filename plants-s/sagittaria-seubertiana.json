    "intro": "Sagittaria seubertiana, commonly known as the water arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with submerged leaves that are narrower and more elongated. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom above the water, typically in late summer. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in shallow water habitats. Sagittaria seubertiana plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic organisms and aiding in water filtration."
