    "intro": "Salix pyrifolia var. laeta, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are oval-shaped, with a serrated margin and a light green color that turns yellow in autumn. It produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive near water sources."
