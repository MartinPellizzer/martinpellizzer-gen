    "intro": "Struthanthus mexicanus, commonly known as the Mexican fairy lantern, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Loasaceae family and is characterized by its striking, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments, often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds. Struthanthus mexicanus is an important component of its native ecosystem, contributing to biodiversity and providing nectar for pollinators."
