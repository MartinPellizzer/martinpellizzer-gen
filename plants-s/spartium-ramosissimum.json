    "intro": "Spartium ramosissimum, commonly known as the slender bush clover, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a slightly hairy surface. Spartium ramosissimum is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its potential use in restoration ecology."
