    "intro": "Sedum tenuifolium subsp. ibericum, commonly known as the Iberian stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Europe. It features fleshy, narrow leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal make it a popular plant among gardeners seeking low-maintenance, resilient flora."
