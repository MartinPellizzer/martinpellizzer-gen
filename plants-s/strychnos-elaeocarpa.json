    "intro": "Strychnos elaeocarpa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its durable wood, which has been traditionally used in furniture and carving. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its native range."
