    "intro": "Steffensia crassinervia, commonly known as the broad-veined steppe grass, is a perennial herb native to the steppes of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 60 cm in height, often branching near the top. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and have prominent, parallel veins, which is a key identifying feature. Steffensia crassinervia is adapted to dry, open habitats and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks."
