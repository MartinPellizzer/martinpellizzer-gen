    "intro": "Solidago altissima, commonly known as the tall goldenrod, is a tall perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its erect stem and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in open areas such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowering heads are arranged in panicles. Solidago altissima plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
