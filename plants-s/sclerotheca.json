    "intro": "Sclerotheca, commonly known as the hard-shelled fruit or seed coat, is a specialized structure found in certain plants, particularly in the legume family. It is composed primarily of lignified cells that provide structural support and protection to the enclosed seed. The sclerotheca often develops from the outer layer of the ovary and may contain specialized cells that aid in seed dispersal. Its thick, durable nature helps the seed withstand environmental stress and mechanical damage. This structure plays a crucial role in the plant's reproductive strategy and survival in various ecological conditions."
