    "intro": "Salix cydoniifolia, commonly known as the pear-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of the pear tree. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often peeling in thin layers, and it is adapted to grow in rocky or alpine environments. Salix cydoniifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
