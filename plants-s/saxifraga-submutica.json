    "intro": "Saxifraga submutica, commonly known as the woolly saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense mats on soil or among stones. The plant features small, ovate leaves that are covered in a fine, woolly layer of white to grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in late summer. Saxifraga submutica is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates."
