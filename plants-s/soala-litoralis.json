    "intro": "Soala litoralis, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in salty, well-drained conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. Soala litoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
