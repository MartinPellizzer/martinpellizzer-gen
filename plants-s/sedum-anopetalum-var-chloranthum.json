The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer, adding a delicate touch to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular selection for landscaping in arid climates."
