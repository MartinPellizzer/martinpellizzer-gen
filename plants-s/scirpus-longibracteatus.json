    "intro": "Scirpus longibracteatus, commonly known as the long-bract sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, triangular spikelets that are often reddish in color. It is characterized by its elongated bracts that give it its common name. Scirpus longibracteatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
