    "intro": "Strobilorhachis glabra, commonly known as the smooth-strobilus plant, is a rare and unique species belonging to the family Strobilaraceae. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and specialized reproductive structures called strobili, which are cone-like formations. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest understories. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited geographic distribution and specific habitat requirements, Strobilorhachis glabra is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
