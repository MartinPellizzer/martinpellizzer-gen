    "intro": "Stauracanthus spartioides var. willkommii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features a low, sprawling growth habit with fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense heads, resembling those of a dandelion. It plays an important ecological role by providing forage for desert wildlife and stabilizing sandy soils."
