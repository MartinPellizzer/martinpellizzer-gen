    "intro": "Saxifraga virginiensis var. yesoensis, commonly known as the Yeso saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in rocky, acidic soils and is often found in woodland or shaded environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually basal, with a waxy texture and a serrated margin. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem."
