    "intro": "Selaginella involvens var. dalbertisii, commonly known as the rock spikerush, is a species of spikemoss found in rocky, arid environments. It is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporangia in clustered structures called strobila, which are typically borne on short stalks. It is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, with a deep root system that helps it retain moisture. This variety is closely related to other species in the Selaginellaceae family and is valued for its resilience and unique morphology."
