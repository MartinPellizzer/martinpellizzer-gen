    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 ikenoana f. subcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a hybrid deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy beneath. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination and seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and parks for its elegant appearance and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
