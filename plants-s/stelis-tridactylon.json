    "intro": "Stelis tridactylon, commonly known as the three-fingered orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The plant features a slender, wiry stem with a few leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its unique floral structure and growth habit make it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts. Stelis tridactylon thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
