It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The plant is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically pollinated by wind.
