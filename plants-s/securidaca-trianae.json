    "intro": "Securidaca trianae, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often found in dry woodlands and savannas, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its slow growth and limited natural range, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
