    "intro": "Stelleropsis iranica subsp. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy Steller's bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense, hairy foliage, which provides it with a unique appearance and aids in moisture retention. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine environments. The plant is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
