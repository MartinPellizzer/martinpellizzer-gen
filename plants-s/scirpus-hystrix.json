    "intro": "Scirpus hystrix, commonly known as the purple rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often turn a striking purple hue, especially in cooler weather. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense clusters at the top of the stems, typically in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in marshy environments. Scirpus hystrix is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils."
