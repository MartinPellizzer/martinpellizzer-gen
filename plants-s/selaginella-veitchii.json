    "intro": "Selaginella veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with upright, spiky stems and small, scale-like leaves. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, which is a characteristic feature of its evolutionary lineage. Selaginella veitchii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique morphology and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
