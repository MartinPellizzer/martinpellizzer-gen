    "intro": "Schimperella aberdarensis, commonly known as the Aberdare rock fern, is a rare and endemic fern species found primarily in the Aberdare Range of Kenya. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in shaded forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically located on the underside of its fronds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Schimperella aberdarensis is considered a vulnerable species."
