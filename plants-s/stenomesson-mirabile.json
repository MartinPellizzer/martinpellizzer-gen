    "intro": "Stenomesson mirabile, commonly known as the fairy lantern, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its unique, lantern-like seed pods. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbels, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. The seed pods, which turn bright red as they mature, are a striking feature and serve as a means of seed dispersal."
