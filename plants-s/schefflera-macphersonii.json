    "intro": "Schefflera macphersonii, commonly known as the Macpherson's umbrella tree, is a tropical plant native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that resemble an umbrella, typically with five to seven leaflets radiating from a central point. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by black, berry-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil and indirect sunlight. Schefflera macphersonii is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
