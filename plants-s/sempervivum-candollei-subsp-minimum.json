    "intro": "Sempervivum candollei subsp. minimum, commonly known as the miniature houseleek, is a low-growing, mat-forming succulent native to the Alps. It features compact rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in diameter. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and sunny environments, thriving in well-drained soil. Its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
