    "intro": "Stryphnodendron humile, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by orange-red fruits containing winged seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
