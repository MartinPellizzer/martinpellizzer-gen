    "intro": "Solidago graminea, commonly known as narrowleaf goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, giving it its common name, and it blooms from late summer into early autumn. Solidago graminea plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies during the late growing season."
