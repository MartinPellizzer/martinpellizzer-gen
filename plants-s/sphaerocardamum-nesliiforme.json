It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers and slender, branched stems. The plant produces small, round berries that contain minute seeds, which are used in traditional medicine. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
