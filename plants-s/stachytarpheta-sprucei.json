    "intro": "Stachytarpheta sprucei, commonly known as the purpletop plant, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant purple or violet bracts that surround its small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Its foliage is lance-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Stachytarpheta sprucei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking color and ecological benefits."
