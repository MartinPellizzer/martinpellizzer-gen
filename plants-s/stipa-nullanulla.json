    "intro": "Stipa nullanulla, commonly known as the Nullarbor grass, is a perennial grass native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Stipa nullanulla is well adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient component of native grassland ecosystems. Its seeds are small and dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
