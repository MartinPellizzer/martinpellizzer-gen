    "intro": "Sagittaria hastata, commonly known as arrowhead or water arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow water, wetlands, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has distinctive arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots anchor in the mud below. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in spikes, often emerging above the water. Sagittaria hastata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
