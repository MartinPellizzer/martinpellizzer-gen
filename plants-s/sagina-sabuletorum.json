    "intro": "Sagina sabuletorum, commonly known as the sand spurry, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to sandy and coastal areas. It has small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or disturbed sandy habitats. Its ability to colonize harsh environments makes it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems."
