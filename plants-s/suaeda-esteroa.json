It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and tidal flats, where it tolerates high salinity levels. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss and store moisture. Its flowers are typically greenish or yellowish, appearing in clusters during the summer months. Suaeda esteroa plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
