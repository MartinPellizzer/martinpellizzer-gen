    "intro": "Saussurea huashanensis, commonly known as the Huashan safflower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy yellow flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude alpine environments, often found in rocky and well-drained soils. Its medicinal properties have been traditionally valued in Chinese herbal medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human encroachment."
