    "intro": "Selaginella zeylanica, commonly known as the tropical spikemoss, is a low-growing vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves that form dense, carpet-like mats on the forest floor. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized spore-producing structures. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Selaginella zeylanica plays a vital role in maintaining soil stability and supporting biodiversity in its native habitats."
