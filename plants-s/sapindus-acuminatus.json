    "intro": "Sapindus acuminatus, commonly known as the Chinese soapberry tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, orange-red flowers. The tree produces small, round fruits that encase a hard, spiny seed. Its fruit is notable for its ability to produce a soapy lather when crushed, which has been traditionally used for cleaning purposes. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
