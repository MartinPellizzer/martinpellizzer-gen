    "intro": "Seseli sclerophyllum, commonly known as the hard-leaved sesame, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, gray-green foliage, which is adapted to withstand the dry, rocky conditions of its natural habitat. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are thick and leathery, a feature typical of many Mediterranean plants that helps reduce water loss. Seseli sclerophyllum is often found in rocky soils and is a common component of scrub and woodland ecosystems."
