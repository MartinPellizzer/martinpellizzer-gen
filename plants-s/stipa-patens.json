It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or gray. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are adorned with delicate, feathery bristles, giving it a distinctive appearance. Stipa patens thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
