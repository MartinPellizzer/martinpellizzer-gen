    "intro": "Salacia praecelsa, commonly known as the golden apple tree, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to the genus Salacia. The plant is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit, which resembles a small apple, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. Salacia praecelsa is also valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
