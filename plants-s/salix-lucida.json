    "intro": "Salix lucida, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a distinctive white or pale mottling. Salix lucida is often found in moist, sandy soils along streams and in wetlands."
