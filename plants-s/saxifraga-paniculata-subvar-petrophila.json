    "intro": "Saxifraga paniculata subvar. petrophila, commonly known as the Sierra stonecrop, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with cool temperatures and well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically succulent, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture. It is often found growing on cliffs, talus slopes, and among boulders in mountainous regions."
