    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum f. roseum, commonly known as the pink potato, is a horticultural form of the common potato. It is characterized by its distinctive pink or violet-colored skin and flesh, which sets it apart from typical white or yellow potatoes. This variety is primarily grown for ornamental purposes rather than culinary use due to its unique appearance. The plant produces tubers that are smaller and less starchy compared to regular potatoes. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
