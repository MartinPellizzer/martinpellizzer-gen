    "intro": "Saxifraga clusii, commonly known as the Clusii saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Saxifraga clusii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
