    "intro": "Salix submyrsinites, commonly known as the red willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, reddish-brown stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, inconspicuous female flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in riparian habitats. The red willow is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in stabilizing riverbanks."
