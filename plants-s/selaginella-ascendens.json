It is characterized by its spiral arrangement of leaves and its ability to grow in a variety of habitats, including rocky soils and shaded environments. This plant is notable for its ability to survive in arid conditions due to its efficient water retention mechanisms. Its life cycle includes both a gametophytic and sporophytic stage, typical of bryophytes and ferns. Selaginella ascendens is also recognized for its use in traditional medicine in some regions."
