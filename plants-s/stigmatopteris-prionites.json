    "intro": "Stigmatopteris prionites, commonly known as the narrow-veined shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant features a distinctive sori arrangement, with the sori positioned near the margin of the fronds and covered by a small, kidney-shaped indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The botanical features of Stigmatopteris prionites make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and scientific study."
