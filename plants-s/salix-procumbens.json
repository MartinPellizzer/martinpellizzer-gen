    "intro": "Salix procumbens, commonly known as the creeping willow, is a shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing form, with multiple stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, silvery down. Its catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, are typically reddish-brown and appear in early spring. Salix procumbens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and other riparian habitats."
