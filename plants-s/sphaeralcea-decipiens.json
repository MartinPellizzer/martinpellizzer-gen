    "intro": "Sphaeralcea decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive globe-mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive globular flower heads, which are composed of numerous small, pink to purple petals. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Sphaeralcea decipiens is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
