    "intro": "Spiranthes neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonia spiraea, is a rare orchid endemic to the island of New Caledonia. It is characterized by its delicate, spiral-shaped inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, preferring rich, well-drained soils. Its flowers are small and white, with a subtle fragrance, and it blooms during the wet season. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
