    "intro": "Stephanopodium sessile, commonly known as the sessile stephanopodium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
