    "intro": "Sorghum comosum, commonly known as Sudan grass, is a tall, robust annual grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its coarse, fibrous leaves and its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that resembles a spike. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in warm, arid climates, making it a valuable forage crop. Its rapid growth and high biomass production make it suitable for erosion control and livestock feed. The seeds, while not typically consumed by humans, are used in some traditional applications."
