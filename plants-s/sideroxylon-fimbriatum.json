    "intro": "Sideroxylon fimbriatum, commonly known as the fringed ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and leathery, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its growth habit and morphological features make it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Sideroxylon fimbriatum is valued for its durability and has been used traditionally for construction and tool-making in its native regions."
