It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves and small, bell-shaped pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to low-light conditions. It is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where the climate is harsh and the growing season is short. This species is an important component of polar ecosystems and is often used as an indicator of environmental change."
