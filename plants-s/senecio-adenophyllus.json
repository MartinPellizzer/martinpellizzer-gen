It features dense, fuzzy foliage that is typically bright yellow to green in color. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a star-like pattern. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
