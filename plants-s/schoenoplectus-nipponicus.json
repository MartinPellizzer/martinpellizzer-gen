    "intro": "Schoenoplectus nipponicus, commonly known as the Japanese bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in marshes, pond edges, and other wetland habitats. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense spikes, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. Schoenoplectus nipponicus is valued for its ecological role in filtering water and providing habitat for various wetland species."
