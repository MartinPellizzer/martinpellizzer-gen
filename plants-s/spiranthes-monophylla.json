    "intro": "Spiranthes monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf ladies' tresses, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spiral arrangement of white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. It has a single, grass-like leaf and produces small, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators like bees and moths. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions and is often protected in conservation efforts."
