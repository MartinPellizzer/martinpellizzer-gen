    "intro": "Sitobolium dubium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, white, orchid-like flowers and its unique ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its delicate structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Sitobolium dubium faces significant threats to its survival."
