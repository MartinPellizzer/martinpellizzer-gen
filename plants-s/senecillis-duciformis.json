    "intro": "Senecillis duciformis, commonly known as the golden cupplant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. Senecillis duciformis prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and shaded woodlands."
