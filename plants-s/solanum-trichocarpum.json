    "intro": "Solanum trichocarpum, commonly known as the hairy fruit tomato, is a species native to South America. It is a herbaceous annual plant that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into hairy, orange-red berries. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs. The fruit is edible and has a flavor similar to that of the common tomato, though it is less widely cultivated."
