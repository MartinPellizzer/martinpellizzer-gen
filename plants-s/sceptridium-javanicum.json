    "intro": "Sceptridium javanicum, commonly known as the Javanese fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and fronds that are typically bipinnate or tripinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are released from sori located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
