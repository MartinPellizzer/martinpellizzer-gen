    "intro": "Solanum darfurense, commonly known as the Darfur nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the semi-arid regions of Sudan. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its berries are typically yellow or orange when ripe and contain toxic alkaloids, making them dangerous if ingested. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though with caution."
