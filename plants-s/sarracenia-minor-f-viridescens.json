    "intro": "Sarracenia minor f. viridescens, commonly known as the green-flowered mosquito hawk, is a striking carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a variant of Sarracenia minor, characterized by its elongated, tubular leaves that form pitchers to trap insects. The foliage of this form exhibits a distinctive green hue, differing from the typical red or orange tones of the species. Its pitchers are narrow and often have a waxy texture, aiding in the adhesion of prey. This plant thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires ample sunlight to maintain its vibrant coloration and growth."
