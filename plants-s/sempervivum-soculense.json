    "intro": "Sempervivum soculense, commonly known as the Carpathian houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the Carpathian Mountains in Europe. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped foliage composed of fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in rocky and arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. It is a low-maintenance plant that prefers full sun and well-draining soil. Sempervivum soculense is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative houseplant due to its hardy nature and attractive appearance."
