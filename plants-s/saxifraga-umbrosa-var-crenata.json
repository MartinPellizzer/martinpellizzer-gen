    "intro": "Saxifraga umbrosa var. crenata, commonly known as the mossy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It thrives in cool, shaded environments, often found in forest understories and rocky crevices. The plant features dense, mat-forming foliage with rounded, leathery leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and clustered in umbels, blooming in late spring to early summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils."
