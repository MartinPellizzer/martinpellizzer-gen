    "intro": "Saxifraga calcicola, commonly known as the limestone saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to calcareous environments. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in alpine or subalpine regions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. Saxifraga calcicola is adapted to harsh, well-drained conditions and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value."
