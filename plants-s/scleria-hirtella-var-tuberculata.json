    "intro": "Scleria hirtella var. tuberculata, commonly known as the hairy bulbous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely covered in short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, three-lobed flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne on slender stalks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to form dense colonies, often in wet or marshy habitats. The varietal name \"tuberculata\" refers to the small, rounded tubercles or bumps on its stems and leaves."
