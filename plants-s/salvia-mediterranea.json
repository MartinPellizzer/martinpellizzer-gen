    "intro": "Salvia mediterranea, commonly known as Mediterranean sage, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often gray-green in color. The plant produces spikes of violet or purple flowers, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Salvia mediterranea is also valued for its aromatic properties and historical use in traditional medicine."
