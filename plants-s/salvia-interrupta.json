    "intro": "Salvia interrupta, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray, fuzzy leaves and clusters of tiny, blue-to-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and long-lasting blooms make it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Salvia interrupta is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
