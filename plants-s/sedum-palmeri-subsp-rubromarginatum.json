    "intro": "Sedum palmeri subsp. rubromarginatum, commonly known as the red-margin sedum, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and leaves that are typically green with red or pink margins. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid environments with minimal irrigation."
