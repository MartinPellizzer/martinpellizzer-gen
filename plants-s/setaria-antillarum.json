    "intro": "Setaria antillarum, commonly known as the Caribbean panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in disturbed soils near human settlements. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
