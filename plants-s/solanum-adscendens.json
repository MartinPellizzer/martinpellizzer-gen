    "intro": "Solanum adscendens, commonly known as the climbing nightshade, is a perennial vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems that climb using tendrils and its alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in the evening, followed by yellowish-orange berries. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants like tomatoes and potatoes. Due to its toxic compounds, it is often avoided in horticulture and requires caution when handling."
