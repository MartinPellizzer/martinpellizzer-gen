It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and its distinctive, waxy, meaty-looking flowers that resemble decaying flesh. The plant's flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators such as flies and beetles. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Stapelia dummeri is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
