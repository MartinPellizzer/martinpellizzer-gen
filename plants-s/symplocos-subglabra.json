    "intro": "Symplocos subglabra, commonly known as the smooth symplocos, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia, including China and India. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds. Symplocos subglabra is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native ecosystems."
