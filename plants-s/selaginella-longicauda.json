    "intro": "Selaginella longicauda, commonly known as the scaly hound's-tongue, is a species of spiky, evergreen plant native to arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, long, trailing stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the reproductive organs. It is well adapted to survive in dry conditions, with a specialized ability to enter a dormant state called poikiloblasty. This unique adaptation allows it to withstand extreme drought and regenerate after rain."
