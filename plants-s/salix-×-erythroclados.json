    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 erythroclados, commonly known as the red-leaf willow, is a hybrid species within the Salicaceae family. It is characterized by its striking red foliage, which becomes more prominent in the autumn season. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate regions and prefers well-drained soils. Its slender, weeping branches and delicate leaves make it a popular ornamental tree. However, it is relatively short-lived and may require regular pruning to maintain its shape and health."
