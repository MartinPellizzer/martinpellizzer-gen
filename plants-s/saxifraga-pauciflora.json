    "intro": "Saxifraga pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions of Eurasia. It typically features rosettes of fleshy, silver-green leaves that are adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous areas with poor nutrient conditions. Saxifraga pauciflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems of high-altitude habitats."
