    "intro": "Siliquastrum occidentale, commonly known as the western bottlebrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking, red-pink bracts that resemble bottle brushes, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. The botanical features of Siliquastrum occidentale make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in its native habitat."
