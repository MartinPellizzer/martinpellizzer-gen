    "intro": "Salix japonica var. padifolia, commonly known as the Japanese weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and along water features."
