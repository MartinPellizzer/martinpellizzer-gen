It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and undergrowth. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in a loose inflorescence, with colorful petals that attract pollinators. Sphaeradenia silvestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
