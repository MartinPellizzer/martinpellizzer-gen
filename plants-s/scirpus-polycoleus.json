    "intro": "Scirpus polycoleus, commonly known as the common bulrush, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its stiff, cylindrical stems and feathery, pale brown inflorescences that appear at the top of the plant. The plant has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often growing in dense clusters at the base. Scirpus polycoleus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and wetland organisms."
