    "intro": "Sciaphila corymbosa, commonly known as the shade-loving orchid, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in summer. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from decaying organic matter in the soil. Sciaphila corymbosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in humid, low-light habitats."
