    "intro": "Stapelia pearsonii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true leaves in its mature form. Stapelia pearsonii is often cultivated for its unusual appearance and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
