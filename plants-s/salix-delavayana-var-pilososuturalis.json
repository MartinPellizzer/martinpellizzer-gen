    "intro": "Salix delavayana var. pilososuturalis, commonly known as the hairy-suture willow, is a variant of the Delavay willow native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive hairy veins on the leaf surfaces, which give it its specific epithet. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate regions and is often found along riverbanks and in mountainous areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture, and it produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations."
