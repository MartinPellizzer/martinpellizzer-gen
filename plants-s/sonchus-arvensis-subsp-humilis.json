    "intro": "Sonchus arvensis subsp. humilis, commonly known as field sowthistle, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal rosettes of pale green, hairy leaves that are typically lobed or toothed. The plant produces yellow flowers in a composite head, which are followed by small, spiky fruits. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a common weed in various habitats."
