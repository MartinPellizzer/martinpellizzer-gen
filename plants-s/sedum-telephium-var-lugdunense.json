    "intro": "Sedum telephium var. lugdunense, commonly known as the Alpine stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial succulent native to the Alps. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and survive in harsh, rocky environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its hardy nature and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice among gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants."
