    "intro": "Scirpus maximus, commonly known as giant bulrush, is a tall, perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its thick, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces small, greenish-brown flowers in dense spikes, which are typically found at the top of the stems. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can form dense colonies, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems. Scirpus maximus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
