    "intro": "Saxifraga recurvifolia, commonly known as the zigzag saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It features rosettes of narrow, recurved leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white to grayish hairs, which help to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late summer, typically arranged in a cluster at the tip of the stem. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra habitats. Due to its specialized adaptations, it is a hardy species that can survive extreme cold and strong winds."
