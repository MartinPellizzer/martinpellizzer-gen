    "intro": "Sapindus surinamensis, commonly known as the soapnut tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine and as a natural detergent due to their saponin content. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spiny pods containing several seeds. Its bark and leaves contain compounds with antimicrobial and antifungal properties. The plant is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining soil stability in its native habitat."
