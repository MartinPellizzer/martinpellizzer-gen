    "intro": "Stipa filabrensis, commonly known as the Filabres needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as steppes and scrublands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
