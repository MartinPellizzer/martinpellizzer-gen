    "intro": "Stachys hirta var. virgata, commonly known as slender betony, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branching stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, which give it a distinctive texture. The leaves are lance-shaped, hairy on both surfaces, and often have a slightly rough texture. Small, tubular flowers in shades of violet or blue appear in whorls along the stems, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. This plant is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
