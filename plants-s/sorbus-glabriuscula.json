    "intro": "Sorbus glabriuscula, commonly known as the smooth-leaf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, pale green leaves that are oval in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
