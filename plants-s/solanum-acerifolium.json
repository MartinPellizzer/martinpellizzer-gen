It is characterized by its distinctive maple-like leaves, which are palmately lobed and often have a striking red or purple coloration. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into berries, which are typically red when ripe. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans. Solanum acerifolium is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes."
