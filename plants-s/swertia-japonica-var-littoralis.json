It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, demonstrating a preference for well-drained, saline environments. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its small, blue to violet flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom during the summer months. This variant is notable for its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions and its role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
