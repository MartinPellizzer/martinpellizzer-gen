    "intro": "Schoenus fluitans var. tenellus, commonly known as the floating bulrush, is a variant of the floating grass species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that float on the surface of still or slow-moving water. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize aquatic sediments and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. It is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes."
