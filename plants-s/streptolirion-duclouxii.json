    "intro": "Streptolirion duclouxii, commonly known as the Ducloux's streptolirion, is a rare and striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to South Africa, specifically the Western Cape region, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, with a unique, twisted form that gives it its common name. It is a bulbous plant that blooms in spring, often with a strong, spicy fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
