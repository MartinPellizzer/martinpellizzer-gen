    "intro": "Scaevola linearis var. confertifolia, commonly known as the dense-leaved fanflower, is a compact, mat-forming perennial native to Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are densely packed, giving it a distinctive, almost feathery appearance. The plant produces small, showy blue or violet flowers in clusters, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ability to spread easily make it a hardy and low-maintenance ornamental plant."
