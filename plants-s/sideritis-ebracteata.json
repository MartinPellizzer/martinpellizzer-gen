It is characterized by its small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. Sideritis ebracteata is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
