    "intro": "Sutera serrata, commonly known as the serrated suture plant, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are serrated, giving it its common name, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Sutera serrata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
