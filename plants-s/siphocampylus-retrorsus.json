It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, prairies, and along stream banks.
