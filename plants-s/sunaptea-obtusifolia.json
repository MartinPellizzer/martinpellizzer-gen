    "intro": "Sunaptea obtusifolia, commonly known as the blunt-leaf sunaptea, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
