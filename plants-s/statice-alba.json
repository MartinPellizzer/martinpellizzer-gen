    "intro": "Statice alba, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its fluffy, white or pink flower heads that resemble small clouds, which are composed of numerous tiny florets. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its narrow, gray-green leaves are adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions. Statice alba is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its long-lasting flowers and ability to thrive in sunny, dry environments."
