    "intro": "Simarouba glauca subsp. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf simarouba, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. The species is often found in lowland tropical forests and is valued for its hard, durable wood."
