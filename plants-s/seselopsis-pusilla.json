    "intro": "Seselopsis pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf sesel, is a small herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale blue flowers in early to mid-summer. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
