    "intro": "Sporobolus rueppellianus, commonly known as the desert threeawn, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and spikelets that are typically arranged in three rows along the stem. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that are adapted for survival in harsh, dry environments. Sporobolus rueppellianus is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in areas with low precipitation."
