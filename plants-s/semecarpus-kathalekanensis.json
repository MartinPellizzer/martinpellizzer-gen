It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, spiny capsules containing angular seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded areas of forests and is valued for its hard, durable wood. However, due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
