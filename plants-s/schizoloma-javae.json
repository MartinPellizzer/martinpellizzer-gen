    "intro": "Schizoloma javae, commonly known as the Java nettle, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, stinging hairs on its stems and leaves, which can cause irritation upon contact with the skin. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in a structure called a cyathium, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Schizoloma javae is often found in wetlands, forests, and along riverbanks in its native range."
