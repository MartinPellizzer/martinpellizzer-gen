    "intro": "Stibasia, commonly known as the \"buttercup\" or \"buttercup plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. They are characterized by their showy, yellow or orange flowers that resemble those of the true buttercup. The leaves are usually basal, arranged in a rosette, and are often covered in fine hairs. Stibasia species are adapted to survive in harsh environments, with some exhibiting succulent properties to store water."
