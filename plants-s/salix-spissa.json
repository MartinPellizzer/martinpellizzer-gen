    "intro": "Salix spissa, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Salix spissa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in landscaping and for its medicinal properties."
