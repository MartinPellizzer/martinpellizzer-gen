    "intro": "Stellaria pedersenii, commonly known as the Pedersen's starwort, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is native to certain regions of North America and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite and lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Stellaria pedersenii is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its aesthetic appeal in native plant gardens."
