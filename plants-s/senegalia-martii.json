    "intro": "Senegalia martii, commonly known as the yellow burrobrush, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and compound leaves, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant is adapted to arid environments and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. Senegalia martii produces pod-like fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
