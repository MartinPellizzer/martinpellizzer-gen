    "intro": "Schedonorus pauneroi, commonly known as the Patagonian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both sterile and fertile florets. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
