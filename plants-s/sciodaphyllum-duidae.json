    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum duidae, commonly known as the Moonlight Fern, is a rare tropical plant native to the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that emit a faint bioluminescent glow under certain conditions. The plant thrives in high humidity and requires partial shade, making it well-suited for shaded, moist environments. Its unique photoluminescent properties have made it a subject of scientific interest. Botanists note that its reproductive cycle involves spore dispersal through wind, typical of many fern species."
