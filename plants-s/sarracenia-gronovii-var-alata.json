    "intro": "Sarracenia gronovii var. alata, commonly known as the winged sunset pitcherplant, is a striking carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, tubular pitchers that are often reddish in color with prominent white veins. The plant's unique feature is its winged, or \"alate,\" lower pitchers, which are broader and more robust than the upper ones. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires high humidity and full sun to flourish. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and its ability to capture and digest insects."
