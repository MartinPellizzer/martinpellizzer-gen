It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, where it is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and threatened species."
