    "intro": "Saccharum bengalense, commonly known as the Bengal grass, is a species of tall, perennial grass native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its robust stalks and large, elongated leaves that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant is often found in wetland areas, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies due to its preference for moist soils. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to its ability to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. Saccharum bengalense plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
