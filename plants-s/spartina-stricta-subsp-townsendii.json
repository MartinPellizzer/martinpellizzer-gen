    "intro": "Spartina stricta subsp. townsendii, commonly known as Townsend's cordgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This subspecies typically grows in brackish or saltwater marshes, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing tidal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which help prevent erosion. Spartina stricta subsp. townsendii is also known for its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels and salinity, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
