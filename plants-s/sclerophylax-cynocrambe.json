    "intro": "Sclerophylax cynocrambe, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, waxy hairs that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by oval, fleshy fruits containing toxic, yellow seeds. Its leaves are thick and leathery, a typical feature of sclerophyllous plants adapted to nutrient-poor soils and drought conditions. Sclerophylax cynocrambe is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is known for its resilience in harsh climates."
