    "intro": "Smilax oldhamii f. subtrifoliata, commonly known as the trifoliate smilax, is a variant of the smilax genus native to the southeastern United States. It is a woody vine characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typically consisting of three leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in loose panicles, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its unique trifoliate leaf structure, which sets it apart from other smilax species."
