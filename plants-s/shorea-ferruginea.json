    "intro": "Shorea ferruginea, commonly known as mangkukukur, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is part of the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its heavy, reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The tree can grow up to 50 meters tall and has large, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, rusty-colored pubescence. It plays an important ecological role in tropical rainforests, providing habitat and contributing to the forest canopy. The species is also known for its slow growth and long lifespan, making it a significant component of old-growth forests."
