    "intro": "Saussurea neoserrata, commonly known as the Tibetan snow lotus, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low oxygen levels. Its rhizomes are often harvested for their medicinal properties, used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
