    "intro": "Selinum baicalense, commonly known as the Baikal skullcap, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern China. It is characterized by its dark blue to violet flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its purported sedative and anti-inflammatory properties. Its botanical name reflects its geographic origin, as \"Baikal\" refers to Lake Baikal in Russia."
