    "intro": "Scabiosa stellata f. reducta, commonly known as the reduced scabious, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, which bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
