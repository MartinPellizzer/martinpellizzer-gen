    "intro": "Salicornia subterminalis, commonly known as sea beans, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in coastal environments with high salinity. It is a succulent species that thrives in sandy or muddy soils along shorelines. The plant produces small, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid conditions. Its flowers are tiny and clustered, typically appearing in pink or red hues. Salicornia subterminalis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
