    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos elatus, commonly known as the giant star-fruit, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble star-shaped clusters, often in bright yellow or orange hues. The plant produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to star fruit, though they are typically larger and have a more complex flavor profile. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, providing a lush green canopy. Sphaerostephanos elatus is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its potential culinary and medicinal uses."
