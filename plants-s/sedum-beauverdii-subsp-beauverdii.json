    "intro": "Sedum beauverdii subsp. beauverdii, commonly known as the Cape Hottentot, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
