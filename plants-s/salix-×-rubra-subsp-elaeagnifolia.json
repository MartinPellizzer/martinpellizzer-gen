    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 rubra subsp. elaeagnifolia, commonly known as the silver willow, is a hybrid willow species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and riparian areas."
