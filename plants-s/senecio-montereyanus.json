    "intro": "Senecio montereyanus, commonly known as Monterey dandelion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of California. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, thriving in salty and windy conditions. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy white seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The species is valued for its hardiness and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
