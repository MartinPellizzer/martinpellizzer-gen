    "intro": "Scrophularia ehrhartii var. samaritanii, commonly known as the Samaritan's Scrophularia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae, which includes many species with showy, often bilaterally symmetrical flowers. The plant typically features slender stems and lance-shaped leaves, with flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
