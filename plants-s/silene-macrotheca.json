    "intro": "Silene macrotheca, commonly known as the broad-leafed catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Silene macrotheca thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
