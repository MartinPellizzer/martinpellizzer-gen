    "intro": "Scaligeria cretica subsp. halophila, commonly known as salt marsh grass or coastal grass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and estuaries where it tolerates high levels of salt in the soil and water. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a waxy coating that reduces water loss and salt absorption. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
