    "intro": "Salix stylaris, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its main means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate catkins. It thrives in moist environments such as riverbanks and wetlands, making it a common sight in riparian habitats. Salix stylaris is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
