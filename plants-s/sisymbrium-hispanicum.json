It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features slender, branched stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive, pitted capsule that splits open when mature to release the seeds.
