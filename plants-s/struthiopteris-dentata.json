    "intro": "Struthiopteris dentata, commonly known as the toothed shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, leathery, evergreen fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are divided into pinnae with a distinctive toothed or serrated margin, which gives the plant its common name. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of many fern species."
