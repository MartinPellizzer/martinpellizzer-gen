    "intro": "Sonnea harknessii, commonly known as the Harkness's sonnea, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and desert scrublands. Its small, yellowish flowers are often arranged in a flat, disc-like structure, and it produces small, dry fruits called cypsela. Sonnea harknessii is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
