    "intro": "Sinapis maritima, commonly known as sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is an annual or biennial plant that thrives in salty, sandy soils along shorelines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a slightly succulent texture, and it has a distinctive spicy aroma. Sinapis maritima is often considered a weed in agricultural settings but is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
