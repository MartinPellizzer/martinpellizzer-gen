    "intro": "Sieversia \u00d7 rhaetica, commonly known as the hybrid sieversia, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Sieversia laevigata and Sieversia rhaeticum. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a terminal inflorescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its limited distribution and hybrid origin, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
