    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 peasei, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid species within the genus Salix, characterized by its distinctive drooping branches that create a cascading effect. It is native to the Northern Hemisphere and is often found near water sources such as rivers and lakes. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a bright green on the upper surface and a lighter green on the underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated. The weeping willow is valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to stabilize soil along waterways."
