    "intro": "Saxifraga polydactyla, commonly known as the \"polypody saxifrage,\" is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It has small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant."
