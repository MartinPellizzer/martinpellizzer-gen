It is a low-growing plant that typically forms dense mats on the forest floor, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant features elongated, segmented stems with small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and contain spores, which are released to propagate the plant. Selaginella consimilis is known for its ability to survive in various soil types and is often found in temperate and tropical regions."
