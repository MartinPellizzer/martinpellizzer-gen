    "intro": "Strychnos oiapocensis, commonly known as the Amazonian devil's backbone, is a climbing plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by distinctive, elongated fruits. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, red aril, which is a characteristic feature of many species in the genus Strychnos. However, like many members of this genus, it contains toxic alkaloids and is not suitable for human consumption."
