    "intro": "Selenipedium \u00d7 grande var. atratum, commonly known as the black-flowered selenipedium, is a rare and striking member of the Araceae family. It is characterized by its large, dark green, strap-like leaves and its dramatic, showy inflorescence that features a single, dark purple to black spadix surrounded by a white or pale green spathe. Native to the cloud forests of Central America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with high atmospheric moisture. Its unique appearance and rarity make it a highly sought-after species among botanical enthusiasts and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires careful cultivation and protection."
