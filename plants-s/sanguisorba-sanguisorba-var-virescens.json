    "intro": "Sanguisorba sanguisorba var. virescens, commonly known as the green-stemmed sorrel, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It features upright, branched stems that are typically green or reddish in color, distinguishing it from other varieties of sanguisorba. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish to red flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly sour taste due to the presence of hydrogen peroxide. This variety is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
