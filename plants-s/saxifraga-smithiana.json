    "intro": "Saxifraga smithiana, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. Saxifraga smithiana is often cultivated in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
