    "intro": "Scirpus subulatus, commonly known as the slender tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower spikes during the summer months. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense tussocks, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. Scirpus subulatus plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and water filtration."
