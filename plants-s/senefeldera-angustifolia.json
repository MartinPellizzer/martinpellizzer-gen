    "intro": "Senefeldera angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf senefeldera, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in umbrella-like clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Senefeldera angustifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
