    "intro": "Silene clandestina var. minor, commonly known as the lesser nightshade or ghost flower, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the northeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are slender and often prostrate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
