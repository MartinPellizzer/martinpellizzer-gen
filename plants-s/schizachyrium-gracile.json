    "intro": "Schizachyrium gracile, commonly known as slender grass or slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and pond edges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands. Schizachyrium gracile is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
