    "intro": "Saxifraga depressa, commonly known as the cushion saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It forms dense, mat-like growths with tightly packed, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late summer. Its succulent leaves are adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. Saxifraga depressa is often found in rocky habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun."
