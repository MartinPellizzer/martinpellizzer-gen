    "intro": "Selaginella galeottii, commonly known as the Christmas moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rosette-like structure with closely packed, scale-like leaves that give it a moss-like appearance. It produces strobilae, or cone-like structures, which contain the plant's spores. Selaginella galeottii is notable for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient and adaptable species."
