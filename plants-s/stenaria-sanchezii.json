    "intro": "Stenaria sanchezii, commonly known as the Sanche's stenaria, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in cooler, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slight pubescence, while its flowers are white or pale yellow. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
