    "intro": "Solanum marantifolium, commonly known as the purple potato vine, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant purple foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Solanum marantifolium is cultivated for its attractive foliage and is sometimes used in gardens as a ground cover or in containers."
