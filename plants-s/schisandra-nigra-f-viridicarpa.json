    "intro": "Schisandra nigra f. viridicarpa, commonly known as the green-fruited five-flavor vine, is a rare and distinctive cultivar of the Schisandra genus. It is characterized by its elongated, dark green berries that remain on the plant throughout the winter, unlike the typical red or yellow fruits of other Schisandra species. The plant is a climbing vine native to the temperate regions of East Asia, particularly China and Korea. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, while its flowers are small and greenish-yellow. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and its unique fruit coloration, making it a sought-after plant in botanical gardens and specialty nurseries."
