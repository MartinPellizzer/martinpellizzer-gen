    "intro": "Santolina pinnata subsp. neapolitana, commonly known as Naples santolina, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features aromatic, silver-gray foliage with finely divided, needle-like leaves that emit a fresh, herbaceous scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters in early summer, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a versatile addition to Mediterranean-style landscapes."
