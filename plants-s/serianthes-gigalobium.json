    "intro": "Serianthes gigalobium, commonly known as the giant lobed tree, is a rare and ancient tree species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its massive, buttressed roots and large, lobed leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a critically endangered species. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique botanical specimen."
