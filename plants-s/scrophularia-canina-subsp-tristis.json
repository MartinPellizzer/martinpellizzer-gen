    "intro": "Scrophularia canina subsp. tristis, commonly known as the dog's mouth or narrow-leaved figwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and can be found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink to purple. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and the plant is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine. The subspecies tristis is distinguished by its narrower leaves and slightly different flowering characteristics compared to the main species."
