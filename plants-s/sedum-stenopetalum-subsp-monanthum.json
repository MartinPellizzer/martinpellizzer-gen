    "intro": "Sedum stenopetalum subsp. monanthum, commonly known as the narrow-petaled stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that help it retain moisture. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, which are typically arranged in tight, spike-like clusters. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
