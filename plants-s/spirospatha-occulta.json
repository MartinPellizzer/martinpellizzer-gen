    "intro": "[WRONG START] Spiropatha occulta, commonly known as the hidden spire orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, spiraling inflorescence and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree bark or in leaf litter. Its unique growth pattern and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires careful protection."
