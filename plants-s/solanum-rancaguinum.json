    "intro": "Solanum rancaguinum, commonly known as the Andean nightshade, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that mature to a deep red color, often containing toxic alkaloids. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments within its native habitat. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
