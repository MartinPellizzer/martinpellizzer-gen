    "intro": "Solanum caroliniense, commonly known as Carolina nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and woodland edges. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries. These berries, which are toxic to humans and animals, contain alkaloids and are often avoided for consumption. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings."
