The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it is known for its ability to thrive in arid conditions. Scleranthus decipiens is often mistaken for other similar species due to its deceptive appearance and growth habits."
