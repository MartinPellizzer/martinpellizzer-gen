    "intro": "Stellarioides robusta, commonly known as the robust starwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with numerous small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Stellarioides robusta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
