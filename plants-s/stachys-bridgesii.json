    "intro": "Stachys bridgesii, commonly known as the purplestem horseweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Stachys bridgesii is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
