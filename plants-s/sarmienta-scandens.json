    "intro": "Sarmienta scandens, commonly known as the climbing milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems that can climb or trail along the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. Sarmienta scandens is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested."
