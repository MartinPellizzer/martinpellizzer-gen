    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 granulatoides, commonly known as the granulate saxifrage, is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, granular texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in gardens as a hardy, low-maintenance plant."
