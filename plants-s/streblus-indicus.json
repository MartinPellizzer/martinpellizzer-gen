    "intro": "Streblus indicus, commonly known as Indian satinwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Moraceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and alternate, simple leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a significant resource in traditional crafts and construction. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
