    "intro": "Selenipedium chironianum, commonly known as the Guatemalan ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated, and often pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant produces a single, showy inflorescence with numerous small, fragrant blooms that bloom once a year. It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in shaded, moist environments with rich, organic soil. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
