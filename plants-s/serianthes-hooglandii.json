    "intro": "Serianthes hooglandii, commonly known as the highland ironwood, is a rare and endangered tree species native to the island of Mindanao in the Philippines. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and slow growth rate, which makes it highly valuable for timber. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth surface. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Due to habitat loss and overexploitation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
