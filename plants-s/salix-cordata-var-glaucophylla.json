    "intro": "Salix cordata var. glaucophylla, commonly known as the glaucophylla willow, is a variant of the heart-leaved willow, characterized by its distinctive grayish-green foliage. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States, often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and wetlands. The leaves are cordate, or heart-shaped, and have a rough, sandpapery texture. It produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination and seed dispersal. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
