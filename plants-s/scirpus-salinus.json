    "intro": "Scirpus salinus, commonly known as salt marsh bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to coastal regions. It thrives in saline and brackish wetlands, often found in estuaries and tidal marshes. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered spikelets that are wind-pollinated. Scirpus salinus plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
