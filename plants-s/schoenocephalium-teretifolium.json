    "intro": "Schoenocephalium teretifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved beautygrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale green or yellowish flowers in dense, spike-like clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
