    "intro": "Silene bifida, commonly known as the split-leaved catchfly, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Silene bifida is a herbaceous perennial that plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
