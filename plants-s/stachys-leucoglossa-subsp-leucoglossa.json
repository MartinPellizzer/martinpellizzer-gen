    "intro": "Stachys leucoglossa subsp. leucoglossa, commonly known as white-lipped betony, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
