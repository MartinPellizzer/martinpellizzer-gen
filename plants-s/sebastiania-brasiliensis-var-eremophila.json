    "intro": "Sebastiania brasiliensis var. eremophila, commonly known as the Brazilian firecracker tree, is a species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to humid, tropical climates. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
