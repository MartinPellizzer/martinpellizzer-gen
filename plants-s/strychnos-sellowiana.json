    "intro": "Strychnos sellowiana, commonly known as the Sellow's strychnos, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its woody shrub or small tree form. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Strychnos sellowiana is also noted for its potential medicinal properties, though it contains toxic alkaloids that require careful handling."
