    "intro": "Selago elongata, commonly known as the slender sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Selago elongata is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and drought conditions."
