    "intro": "Salix udensis subsp. sachalinensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and whitish or hairy beneath. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and tidal zones. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
