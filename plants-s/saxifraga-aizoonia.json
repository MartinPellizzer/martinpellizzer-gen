    "intro": "Saxifraga aizoonia, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe and Asia. It typically grows in crevices and on rock surfaces, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. The plant features small, clustered leaves and produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it a resilient species in high-altitude regions. Saxifraga aizoonia plays a role in stabilizing rocky terrain and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
