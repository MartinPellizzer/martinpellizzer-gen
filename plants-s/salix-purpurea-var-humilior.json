    "intro": "Salix purpurea var. humilior, commonly known as the purple willow dwarf form, is a low-growing shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The leaves are typically a striking purplish hue, especially on the underside, which distinguishes it from other willow varieties. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, contributing to its ornamental value. This variety is often used in horticulture for its compact size and attractive foliage."
