    "intro": "Silphium integrifolium var. mesochorum, commonly known as the eastern prickly pear, is a perennial cactus native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its spiny, paddle-shaped stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces edible, fleshy fruits that are typically consumed by wildlife. The species is notable for its ecological importance and historical use by indigenous peoples."
