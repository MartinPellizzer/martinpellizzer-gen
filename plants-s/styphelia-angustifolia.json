    "intro": "Styphelia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeastern Australia. It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, arranged in dense clusters along its stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers during the late winter to spring months. Styphelia angustifolia thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal heaths. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat for native wildlife."
