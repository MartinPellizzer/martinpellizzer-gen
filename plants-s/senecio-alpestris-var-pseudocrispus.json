    "intro": "Senecio alpestris var. pseudocrispus, commonly known as the Alpine groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually gray-green with a pubescent surface, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. This variety is distinguished by its slightly curled leaf margins, giving it a more compact appearance compared to the typical form."
