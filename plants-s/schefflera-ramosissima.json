    "intro": "Schefflera ramosissima, commonly known as the giant schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-like clusters of bright green, palmate leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil and partial to full sunlight. Schefflera ramosissima is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and adaptability to indoor environments."
