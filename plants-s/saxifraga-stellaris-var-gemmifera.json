    "intro": "Saxifraga stellaris var. gemmifera, commonly known as the gemmed star saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of northern Europe and Asia. It features dense clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. This variety is notable for its ability to produce vegetative offshoots, or gemmae, which allow it to spread and colonize new areas effectively."
