    "intro": "Sisymbrium runcinatum var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate wild radish, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of pinnately lobed, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters at the top of slender stems. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
