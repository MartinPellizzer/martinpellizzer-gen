It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, prostrate stems that often form a dense mat. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the flowers are small, white, and star-shaped, typically arranged in clusters. This plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, gardens, and along pathways. It is characterized by its delicate appearance and ability to spread rapidly through seed dispersal."
