    "intro": "Stapelia halipedicola var. borealis, commonly known as the Northern Stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. It is a slow-growing species that prefers well-draining soil and full sun exposure."
