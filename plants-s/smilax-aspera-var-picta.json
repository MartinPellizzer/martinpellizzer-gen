It features compound leaves with a striking variegation pattern, often displaying shades of green, yellow, and white. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to red, berry-like fruits. Its stems are armed with sharp, recurved spines, making it both distinctive and potentially hazardous to handle. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its unique appearance."
