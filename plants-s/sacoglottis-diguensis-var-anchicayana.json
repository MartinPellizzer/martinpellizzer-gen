It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its bark is thick and fibrous, which provides structural support and helps retain moisture. This variant is often found in humid, lowland forests where it thrives in partial shade."
