    "intro": "Serapias occultata f. knochei, commonly known as the Knoche's serapias, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow flowers with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects, a feature known as mimicry. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, preferring sunny and well-drained habitats. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
