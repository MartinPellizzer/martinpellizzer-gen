    "intro": "Santalodes floridum, commonly known as the Florida sandalwood, is a hemiparasitic shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a unique root system that allows it to absorb nutrients from other plants, making it a partial parasite. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and scrub habitats. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
