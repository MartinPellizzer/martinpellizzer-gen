    "intro": "Sanguisorba unsanensis, commonly known as the Korean dropwort, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, reddish-brown flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
