    "intro": "Sprengelia montana, commonly known as the mountain spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rocky or arid landscapes. Sprengelia montana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
