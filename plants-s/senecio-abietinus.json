    "intro": "Senecio abietinus, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive foliage. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Senecio abietinus plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in rocky or grassy slopes."
