    "intro": "Selaginella subarborescens, commonly known as the tree spikemoss, is a vascular fern that exhibits unique botanical features. It is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a trait typical of many spore-bearing plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its morphology and reproductive strategies make it an important subject in the study of early land plant evolution."
