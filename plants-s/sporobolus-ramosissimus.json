    "intro": "Sporobolus ramosissimus, commonly known as hairy grama, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Sporobolus ramosissimus is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ecological value."
