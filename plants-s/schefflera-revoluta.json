    "intro": "Schefflera revoluta, commonly known as the rolled-leaf umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like clusters of large, leathery, dark green leaves that often have a slightly curled or revolute margin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a decorative indoor or outdoor plant. Its adaptability and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for both ornamental and horticultural purposes."
