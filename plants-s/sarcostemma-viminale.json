It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that contain seeds. It is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in open woodlands. Its milky sap, which is toxic, is a notable feature of its botanical description."
