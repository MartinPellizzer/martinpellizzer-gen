    "intro": "Styphelia abnormis, commonly known as the abnormal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, leathery leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming from late summer to autumn. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in heathland and coastal scrub environments. Styphelia abnormis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
