    "intro": "Syntherisma aequatoriensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian syntherism, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
