    "intro": "Spathiphyllum tenerum, commonly known as the velvet leaf peace lily, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, dark green, velvety leaves that are often ribbed and have a waxy texture. The plant produces striking white spathes that enclose small, greenish-white flowers, which are typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in low-light conditions and requires moderate moisture and well-draining soil. Spathiphyllum tenerum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appeal and air-purifying qualities."
