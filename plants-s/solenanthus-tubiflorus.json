    "intro": "Solenanthus tubiflorus, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tubular, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a contrasting throat. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Solenanthus tubiflorus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
