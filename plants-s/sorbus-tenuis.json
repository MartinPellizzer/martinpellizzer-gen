    "intro": "Sorbus tenuis, commonly known as the slender whitebeams, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by small, berry-like fruits that turn red in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
