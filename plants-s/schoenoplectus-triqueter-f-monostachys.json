    "intro": "Schoenoplectus triqueter f. monostachys, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a wetland plant characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a tight spiral around the stem. Its flowers are small and clustered, with three stamens and a single pistil, typical of the Cyperaceae family. This variety is distinguished by its monostachys inflorescence, which produces a single, elongated spike of flowers."
