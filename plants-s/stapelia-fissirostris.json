    "intro": "Stapelia fissirostris, commonly known as the fissured-stem stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that is often ribbed and covered in a waxy, grayish-green coating. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive, almost fleshy appearance. These flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, often in clusters at the base of the stem. Stapelia fissirostris is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems and requiring minimal care once established."
