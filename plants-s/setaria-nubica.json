    "intro": "Setaria nubica, commonly known as the cloudsetaria, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can tolerate high temperatures and low moisture levels. Due to its resilience, Setaria nubica is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and degraded grasslands."
