It is characterized by its white to pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters, typically in early spring. The plant produces small, red-orange berries that are edible for birds but generally unpalatable to humans. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a serrated margin. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
