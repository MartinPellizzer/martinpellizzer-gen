    "intro": "Saxifraga hypericoides var. rockii, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features a low-growing rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hair. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually pink or white and appear in clusters during the summer months. It is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions."
