    "intro": "Selaginella subdentata, commonly known as the lesser spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its creeping stems and small, needle-like leaves that are often slightly serrated. It produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of its branches. Selaginella subdentata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
