    "intro": "Solaria brevicoalita, commonly known as the short-stemmed sunflower, is a herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of North America. It features a compact, upright growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a single head, which bloom in late summer. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in dry conditions by efficiently absorbing and storing water. Solaria brevicoalita is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
