    "intro": "Sinarundinaria densifolia, commonly known as the Chinese cliffbrake, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the undersides of its leaves, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky surfaces. Sinarundinaria densifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
