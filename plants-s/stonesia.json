    "intro": "Stonesia, commonly known as stonecrop, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae. These plants are characterized by their succulent leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or rosettes. They are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are well adapted to rocky or arid environments. Stonesia species typically produce small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. Many varieties are popular in horticulture for their hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
