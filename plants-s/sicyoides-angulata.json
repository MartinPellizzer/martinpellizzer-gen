    "intro": "Sicyoides angulata, commonly known as the angular sicyoid, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of many palm species. Its growth habit is often clumped, and it thrives in coastal and wetland environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
