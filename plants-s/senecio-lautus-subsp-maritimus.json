    "intro": "Senecio lautus subsp. maritimus, commonly known as the sea lettuce or coastal groundsel, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline, often growing in dense mats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh coastal conditions."
