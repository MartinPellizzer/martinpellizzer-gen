    "intro": "Sporobolus camporum, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the United States. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce wind-dispersed seeds. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and dunes. Its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions makes it an important component of native plant communities. The plant's unique seed dispersal mechanism, where seeds are ejected from the spikelets, contributes to its ecological success."
