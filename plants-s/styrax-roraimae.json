    "intro": "Styrax roraimae, commonly known as the Roraima styrax, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Venezuela and Brazil. It belongs to the family Styracaceae and is characterized by its fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces a resinous sap, which is similar to that of other styrax species, and is used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth texture, while its bark is thick and fibrous. Styrax roraimae is often found in moist, shaded areas of the rainforest, contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
