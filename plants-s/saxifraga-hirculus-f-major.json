    "intro": "Saxifraga hirculus f. major, commonly known as the Great Wall saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically thick and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as an ornamental plant in colder climates."
