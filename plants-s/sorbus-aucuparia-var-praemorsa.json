It is characterized by its dark, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in late summer. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
