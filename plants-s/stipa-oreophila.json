    "intro": "Stipa oreophila, commonly known as the mountain needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Stipa oreophila plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
