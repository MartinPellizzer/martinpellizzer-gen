It features a rosette of narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early summer. Its root system is fibrous and can be somewhat tuberous, contributing to its historical use in traditional medicine. Scorzonera humilis subsp. tenuifolia is adapted to rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
