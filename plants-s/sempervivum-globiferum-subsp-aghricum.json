It features dense, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
