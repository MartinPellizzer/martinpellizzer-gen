    "intro": "Salvia inornata, commonly known as the Mexican mint marigold, is a perennial herb native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It features square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale lavender to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Salvia inornata thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardens."
