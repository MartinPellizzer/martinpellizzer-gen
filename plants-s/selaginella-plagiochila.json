    "intro": "Selaginella plagiochila, commonly known as the zigzag spikemoss, is a member of the spikemoss family (Selaginellaceae) and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its spirally arranged, needle-like leaves and a branching, creeping stem system. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Selaginella plagiochila is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
