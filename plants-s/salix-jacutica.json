    "intro": "Salix jacutica, commonly known as the Siberian willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the cold regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and along the edges of lakes. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in colder climates."
