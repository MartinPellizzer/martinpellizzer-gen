    "intro": "Schefflera pauciradiata, commonly known as the lowland schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like clusters of leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has compound leaves with multiple leaflets arranged in a radiating pattern, typical of the Araliaceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Schefflera pauciradiata is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
