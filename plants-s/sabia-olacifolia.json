    "intro": "Sabia olacifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant belongs to the Rutaceae family and is known for its aromatic leaves and small, yellowish flowers. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with multiple stems and a sprawling form. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
