    "intro": "Selliguea omeiensis, commonly known as the Omei lungwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its rosette-like growth pattern and bright green leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, translucent cells. Its reproductive structures, known as sorocarps, are borne on short stalks and contain the spores necessary for propagation. This species is native to China and is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
