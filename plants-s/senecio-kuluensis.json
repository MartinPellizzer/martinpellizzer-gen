    "intro": "Senecio kuluensis, commonly known as the Kulu groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in rocky and grassy habitats at elevations above 2,500 meters. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
