    "intro": "Sciaphila ledermannii, commonly known as the Ledermann's ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in the understorey of dense vegetation. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
