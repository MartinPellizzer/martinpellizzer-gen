    "intro": "Sambucus \u00d7 fontenayi, commonly known as the common elderberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Sambucus nigra and Sambucus racemosa. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters. The plant is characterized by its clusters of small, white to pale green flowers that appear in late spring, followed by dark purple to black berries in the fall. These berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic seeds and should be prepared properly before consumption. The plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to various parts of North America."
