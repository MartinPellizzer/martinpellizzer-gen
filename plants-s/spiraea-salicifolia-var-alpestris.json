    "intro": "Spiraea salicifolia var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine spiraea, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plants."
