    "intro": "Saxifraga subalpina, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. The plant features basal rosettes of elliptical, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its small, white or pinkish flowers bloom in late summer, producing clusters of five to seven petals. Saxifraga subalpina is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient member of alpine flora."
