    "intro": "Satyria neglecta, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. The plant has thin, wiry stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, clustered in racemes, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Satyria neglecta is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can go through periods of dormancy during extreme drought conditions."
