    "intro": "Sempervivum hirtum f. glabrescens, commonly known as the Woolly Houseleek, is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves. The leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white, woolly hairs, giving the plant its common name. This variety is a naturally occurring form of Sempervivum hirtum, distinguished by its reduced pubescence compared to the typical form. It is native to southern Europe and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is drought-tolerant and suitable for rock gardens or as a houseplant due to its low maintenance requirements."
