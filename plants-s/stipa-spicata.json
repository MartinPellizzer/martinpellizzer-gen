    "intro": "Stipa spicata, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Stipa spicata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
