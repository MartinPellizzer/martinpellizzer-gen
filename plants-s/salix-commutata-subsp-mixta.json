    "intro": "Salix commutata subsp. mixta, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a shrub native to parts of Asia, particularly China and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its flexible, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist or wet environments. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, greenish fruits that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically elongated, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and they turn yellow in the fall. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its tolerance of poor soil conditions and its role in stabilizing riverbanks."
