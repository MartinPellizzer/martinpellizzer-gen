    "intro": "Sanguinaria stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled bloodroot, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features a single, striking red-orange flower that blooms in early spring, often before its leaves emerge. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and produces small, dark red berries that ripen in late summer. Its foliage consists of large, palmately divided leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy. Sanguinaria stenopetala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in woodland gardens."
