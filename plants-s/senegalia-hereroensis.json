    "intro": "Senegalia hereroensis, commonly known as the Herero acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its straight, often multi-branched trunk and bipinnate leaves that are usually reduced to spines. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in compact clusters, which are followed by flat, leathery pods containing seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry regions. Senegalia hereroensis plays a role in both ecological and traditional uses in its native habitat."
