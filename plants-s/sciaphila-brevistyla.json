    "intro": "Sciaphila brevistyla, commonly known as the short-styled ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in the understory of dense forests. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pale green leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in shades of white and green. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this unique botanical species from habitat destruction and over-collection."
