    "intro": "Smilax basilata, commonly known as sweet flag or swamp lily, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It features woody stems with sharp, spiny thorns and heart-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a bright red, three-lobed berry that ripens in the fall. Smilax basilata is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments."
