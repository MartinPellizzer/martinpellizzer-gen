    "intro": "Stellilabium perlobatum, commonly known as the star-labium orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped petals that range in color from pale pink to deep violet. The plant has a delicate, sympodial growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. It blooms during the cooler months, typically from September to November. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
