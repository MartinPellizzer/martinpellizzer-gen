    "intro": "Stapelia hirsuta var. depressa, commonly known as the woolly stapelia or the dwarf stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems covered in soft, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellowish-green with a strong, unpleasant odor, resembling decaying flesh. It is a low-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is a popular choice for collectors and succulent enthusiasts."
