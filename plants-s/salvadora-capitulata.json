    "intro": "Salvadora capitulata, commonly known as the desert date tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed. Salvadora capitulata is well adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can thrive with minimal water."
