    "intro": "Spiraea hookeri, commonly known as Hooker's spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features arching stems covered in small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early summer, which are borne on long, slender pedicels. Its foliage turns a vibrant yellow in the fall, adding ornamental value to the landscape. Spiraea hookeri is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in forested areas."
