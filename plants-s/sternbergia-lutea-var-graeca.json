    "intro": "Sternbergia lutea var. graeca, commonly known as the Greek yellow star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow, star-shaped flowers in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. It is closely related to other members of the Amaryllidaceae family, sharing similar growth habits and floral structures. Due to its ornamental value and early blooming period, it is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, early-season display."
