    "intro": "Siler salsum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking, spiky blue or purple flower heads that resemble a crown of thorns. The plant has silvery, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its saline and windy habitat. Siler salsum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and seaside cliffs. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
