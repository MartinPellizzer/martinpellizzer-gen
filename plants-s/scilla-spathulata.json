    "intro": "Scilla spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale blue flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its bulbs are toxic and should be handled with care, though the plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and early bloom. Scilla spathulata is also known for its ability to naturalize and form dense colonies over time."
