    "intro": "Sagittaria graminea subsp. chapmanii, commonly known as Chapman's arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features arrowhead-shaped leaves that float on the water surface or emerge from the water, with long, slender stems. Its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, often appearing above the water. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting aquatic life and its aesthetic appeal in wetland environments."
