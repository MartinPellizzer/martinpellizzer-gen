    "intro": "Stelis tritriangulata, commonly known as the Triangular Stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features elongated, strap-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
