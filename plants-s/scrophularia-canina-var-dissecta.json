    "intro": "Scrophularia canina var. dissecta, commonly known as the dog's mouth or narrow-leaved figwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often deeply lobed or dissected, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges, stream banks, and meadows. Scrophularia canina var. dissecta is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
