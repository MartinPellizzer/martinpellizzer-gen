It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological studies and potential agricultural use."
