    "intro": "Sphaerocionium rufum, commonly known as the red globular liverwort, is a small, leafy liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and bright red or orange coloration, which is due to the presence of carotenoids. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its structure consists of a thallus with closely packed, rounded leaves that form a compact rosette. Sphaerocionium rufum is often found in temperate regions and is an indicator species for undisturbed, humid habitats."
