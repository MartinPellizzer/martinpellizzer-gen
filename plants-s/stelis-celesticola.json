    "intro": "Stelis celesticola, commonly known as the celestial orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are often white or pale blue, with intricate patterns resembling celestial imagery, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good drainage for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
