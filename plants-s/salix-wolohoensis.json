    "intro": "Salix wolohoensis, commonly known as the Wolohosan willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of central China. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, typical of many willow species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
