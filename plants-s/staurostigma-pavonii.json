    "intro": "Staurostigma pavonii, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Staurostigma pavonii is often found in disturbed habitats and can be invasive in some areas."
