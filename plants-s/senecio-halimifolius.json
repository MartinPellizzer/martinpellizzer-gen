    "intro": "Senecio halimifolius, commonly known as the African snowbush, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-gray leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
