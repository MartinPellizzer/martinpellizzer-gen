    "intro": "Solidago altissima var. recurvata, commonly known as the recurved goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often growing in moist or wetland habitats. The plant produces small, yellow inflorescences composed of numerous disk flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This variety is notable for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
