    "intro": "Solanum innoxium, commonly known as the death apple, is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is a shrub native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and is characterized by its toxic, yellow-orange berries. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are ovate and have a rough, hairy texture. Due to its high toxicity, it is often avoided in gardens and is considered a weed in some regions."
