    "intro": "Strychnos asperula, commonly known as the rough-seed strychnos, is a small shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous coating. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or medicinal purposes."
