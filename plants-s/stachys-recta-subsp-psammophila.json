It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its botanical features make it an important plant in ecological restoration projects in dry environments."
