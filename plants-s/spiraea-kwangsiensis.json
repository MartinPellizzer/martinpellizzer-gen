It is characterized by its dense, cascading clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, arching branches that give it a delicate, weeping appearance. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and turn yellow in the fall. Spiraea kwangsiensis is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and ease of cultivation."
