It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or inland dunes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
