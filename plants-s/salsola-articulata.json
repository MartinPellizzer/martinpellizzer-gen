    "intro": "Salsola articulata, commonly known as jointed gooseweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing, perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant has succulent, fleshy stems that are often segmented, giving it its common name. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Salsola articulata is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with mechanisms to store water and reduce water loss."
