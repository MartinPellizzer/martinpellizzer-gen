    "intro": "Stizolophus balsamitella, commonly known as the balsam bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic invertebrates. The plant has no true roots and relies on its specialized bladders for nutrient absorption. Its leaves are thin and delicate, adapted for floating on the water's surface. It plays a unique ecological role in nutrient-poor aquatic environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
