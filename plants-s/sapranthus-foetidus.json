    "intro": "Sapranthus foetidus, commonly known as the stinking saffron, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has strap-like leaves and produces a strong, unpleasant odor, which is likely a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Despite its pungent scent, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens."
