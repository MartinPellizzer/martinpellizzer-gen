    "intro": "Solanum grayi, commonly known as the Gray's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, tomatoes, and potatoes. The plant typically grows as an annual shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually violet or purple, with five petals, and it produces small, round berries that contain toxic alkaloids. Due to its toxicity, it is considered a weed in some areas and is often avoided in agricultural settings."
