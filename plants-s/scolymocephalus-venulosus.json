    "intro": "Scolymocephalus venulosus, commonly known as the slender scolymus, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its life cycle is annual, with the plant completing its growth, flowering, and seed production within a single growing season. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in its native habitat."
