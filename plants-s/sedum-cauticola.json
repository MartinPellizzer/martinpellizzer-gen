    "intro": "Sedum cauticola, commonly known as the rock sedum, is a succulent plant native to rocky and arid environments. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that help it store water. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in harsh conditions with minimal water."
