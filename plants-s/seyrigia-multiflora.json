    "intro": "Seyrigia multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered seyrigia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Seyrigia multiflora produces small, yellow to orange flowers arranged in dense clusters, which attract various pollinators. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments."
