    "intro": "Spirogardnera, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that come in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plants typically grow as perennials, forming low, compact shrubs with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Spirogardnera species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in gardens for their vibrant blooms and hardiness. They prefer well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making them suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings."
