    "intro": "Selaginella indica, commonly known as the Indian spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant in the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its creeping stems and small, needle-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls. Selaginella indica reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in humid conditions."
