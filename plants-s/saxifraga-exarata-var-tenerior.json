    "intro": "Saxifraga exarata var. tenerior, commonly known as the cushion saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, cold climates. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, providing some insulation against the cold. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and barren environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils."
