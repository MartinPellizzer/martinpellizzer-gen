    "intro": "Salix oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and have a slightly hairy underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers clustered together. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in alpine environments. Salix oblongifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
