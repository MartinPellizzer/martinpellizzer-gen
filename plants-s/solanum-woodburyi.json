    "intro": "Solanum woodburyi, commonly known as the Woodbury nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States, particularly Arizona and New Mexico, where it grows in rocky, arid environments. The plant is characterized by its small, showy purple flowers and smooth, often hairy stems. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge, and it produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Solanum woodburyi plays a role in its ecosystem by providing food for certain insect species and serving as a habitat for small organisms."
