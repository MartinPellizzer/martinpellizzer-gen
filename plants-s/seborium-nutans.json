    "intro": "Seborium nutans, commonly known as the nodding seborium, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pendulous inflorescences, which consist of small, yellowish flowers clustered in elongated spikes. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a fine, waxy coating that aids in moisture retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Seborium nutans is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
