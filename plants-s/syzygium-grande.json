    "intro": "Syzygium grande, commonly known as the large tamarind tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that develop into elongated, woody pods. The fruit, which contains several seeds, is used in traditional medicine and as a source of tamarind pulp. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall and has a dense canopy, making it an important shade tree in its native habitat. Its botanical features make it valuable for both ecological and economic purposes."
