    "intro": "Salix sitchensis var. coulteri, commonly known as Coulter's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in wetlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
