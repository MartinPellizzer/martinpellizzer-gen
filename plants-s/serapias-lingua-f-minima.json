    "intro": "Serapias lingua f. minima, commonly known as the miniature tongue orchid, is a rare and compact variant of the serapias genus. It is a low-growing perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, delicate flower that resembles a small tongue. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It blooms in late spring or early summer, producing a vivid yellow or orange flower with a distinctive, elongated shape. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in some areas."
