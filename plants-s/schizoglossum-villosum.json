    "intro": "Schizoglossum villosum, commonly known as the hairy schizoglossum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Schizoglossum villosum is adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in sandy or rocky soils. Its hairy leaves and stems provide a degree of drought resistance and are often covered in fine, soft hairs."
