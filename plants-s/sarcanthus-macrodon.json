    "intro": "Sarcanthus macrodon, commonly known as the giant flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy, red-orange bracts that resemble flowers but are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a contrasting color to its vibrant display. Sarcanthus macrodon thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in tropical and subtropical regions."
