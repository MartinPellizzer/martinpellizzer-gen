    "intro": "Salix chevalieri, commonly known as the Chinese weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a graceful appearance. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, typically with a bluish-green hue on top and a silvery underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by small, round fruits. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a variety of soil types."
