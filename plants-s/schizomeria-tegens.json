    "intro": "Schizomeria tegens, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or subshrub characterized by its gray-green, hairy foliage and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are often succulent, storing water to help it endure long periods without rainfall. Schizomeria tegens plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
