    "intro": "Silene uniflora subsp. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate campion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its prostrate or decumbent stems that lie close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. Silene uniflora subsp. prostrata is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in nutrient-poor environments."
