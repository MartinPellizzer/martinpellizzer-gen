    "intro": "Sophora tetraptera subsp. howinsula, commonly known as the island sophora, is a small, deciduous tree or shrub native to the islands of the South China Sea. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have four pairs of leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, woody pods containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in coastal areas and limestone soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
