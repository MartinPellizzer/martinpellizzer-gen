    "intro": "Sebaea glauca, commonly known as the bluebells or sea bluebells, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the seashore, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is often found in dense clusters along the coastline. Sebaea glauca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens."
