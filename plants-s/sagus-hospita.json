    "intro": "Sagus hospita, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray leaves and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the evening. It produces berries that turn from green to yellow or red as they mature. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in gardens and is considered a weed in some regions."
