    "intro": "Styphelia tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a low-growing shrub with small, dense leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, urn-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white in color. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. Styphelia tetragona is often found in heathlands and is an important component of the local flora."
