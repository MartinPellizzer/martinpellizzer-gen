It features a slender, branching stem that often grows close to the ground, with numerous leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in a cylindrical inflorescence. Its leaves are typically linear to lanceolate, with a rough, hairy texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a succulent in arid environments."
