    "intro": "Statice brassicifolia, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its ability to thrive in salty, well-drained soils. The plant produces dense clusters of small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly succulent, adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. Statice brassicifolia is often used in dried floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms and ornamental value."
