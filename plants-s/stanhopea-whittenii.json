    "intro": "Stanhopea whittenii, commonly known as the Whitten's stanhopea, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its tall, erect inflorescence and large, showy flowers with intricate patterns of purple and white. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within lowland forests. Its flowers are highly fragrant and attract various pollinators, including bees and moths. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Stanhopea whittenii is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
