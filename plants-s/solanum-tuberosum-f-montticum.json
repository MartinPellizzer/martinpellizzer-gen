    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum f. montticum, commonly known as the mountain potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato. It is characterized by its smaller, elongated tubers that often have a rough, netted skin. This form is typically found in high-altitude regions, where it adapts to cooler and more variable climatic conditions. The plant belongs to the Solanaceae family, sharing traits with other nightshade species. Its genetic diversity makes it an interesting subject for agricultural research and breeding programs."
