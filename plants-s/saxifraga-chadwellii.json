    "intro": "Saxifraga chadwellii, commonly known as Chadwell's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of western North America. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often found in mountainous areas of Idaho and Montana. The plant features basal rosettes of dark green, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Small, white or pinkish flowers appear in spring, clustered at the ends of short stems. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in open, sunny habitats where it can withstand strong winds and low temperatures."
