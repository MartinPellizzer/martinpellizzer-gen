It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and its delicate, spirally arranged flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and swamps. Its flowers are white with greenish streaks and are pollinated by nocturnal moths. This variety is distinguished by its longer petioles compared to the typical form of Spiranthes chloroleuca."
