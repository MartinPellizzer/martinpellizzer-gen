It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and rockeries for its attractive foliage and delicate blooms."
