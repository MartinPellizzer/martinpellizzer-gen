    "intro": "Seriphidium mucronulatum, commonly known as the desert gumweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and woolly, gray-green foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Seriphidium mucronulatum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
