It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the short growing season. Its leaves are typically succulent and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude and polar habitats."
