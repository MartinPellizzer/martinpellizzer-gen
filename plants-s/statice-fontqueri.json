    "intro": "Statice fontqueri, commonly known as the sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and dense clusters of small, showy blue or violet flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, saline soils and is often found growing in sandy or rocky habitats. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with silver-gray tones that help it withstand coastal conditions. Statice fontqueri is valued in gardens for its hardiness and ability to add color to coastal landscapes."
