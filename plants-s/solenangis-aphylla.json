    "intro": "Solenangis aphylla, commonly known as the leafless orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, a trait that sets it apart from most other orchids. The plant produces a single, elongated stem that bears a cluster of small, white or pale green flowers. Native to specific regions in South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its distinctive morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
