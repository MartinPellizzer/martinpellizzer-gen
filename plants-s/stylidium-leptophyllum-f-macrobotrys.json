    "intro": "Stylidium leptophyllum f. macrobotrys, commonly known as the large-flowered slender pincushion, is a variant of the slender pincushion plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its elongated, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant features a hairy, upright stem with small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their shape and nectar production. This form is notable for its larger floral size compared to the typical variety, making it a distinctive and ornamental species."
