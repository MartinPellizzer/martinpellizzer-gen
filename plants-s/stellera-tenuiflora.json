    "intro": "Stellera tenuiflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered starwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has opposite, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Stellera tenuiflora is typically found in temperate regions and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying plant adaptations to wetland habitats."
