    "intro": "Smilax polyandra, commonly known as the arrowroot vine, is a climbing plant native to the southeastern United States. It features a woody stem with thorned nodes and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is notable for its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its roots are sometimes harvested for their starchy content, though they are not as commonly used as true arrowroot. Smilax polyandra thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
