    "intro": "Sphaerorrhiza sarmentiana, commonly known as the creeping root-vein plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a fibrous root system and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes to form new plants. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. The species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of local flora."
