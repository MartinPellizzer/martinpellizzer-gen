    "intro": "Syzygium wenshanense, commonly known as the Wenshan sandalwood, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, aromatic wood, which is highly valued in traditional Chinese medicine and perfumery. The plant typically grows in subtropical regions, thriving in well-drained soils and humid climates. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, while its flowers are small and white, often clustered in inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, Syzygium wenshanense is considered critically endangered."
