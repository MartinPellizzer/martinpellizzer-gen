    "intro": "Silene pomelii, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh environment. Its stems are often prostrate or ascending, growing close to the ground to reduce water loss. Silene pomelii plays an important ecological role in desert ecosystems by providing nectar and habitat for various insect species."
