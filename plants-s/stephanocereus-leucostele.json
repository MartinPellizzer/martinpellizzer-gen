It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, pale green stems that can grow quite tall. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water. Its structure and blooming habits make it a unique and striking member of the Cactaceae family."
