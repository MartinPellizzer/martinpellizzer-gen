It features a short, cylindrical stem covered with a dense layer of white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts and collectors."
