It features small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branched stems covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it its common name. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with a dense layer of fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
