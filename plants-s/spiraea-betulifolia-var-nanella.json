    "intro": "Spiraea betulifolia var. nanella, commonly known as the dwarf willow-leaf spirea, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, willow-like leaves that are alternate and ovate, with a finely toothed margin. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, arching stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its low-growing habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
