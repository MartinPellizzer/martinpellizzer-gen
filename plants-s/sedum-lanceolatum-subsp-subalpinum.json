    "intro": "Sedum lanceolatum subsp. subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine sedum, is a perennial succulent plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. The plant features fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually small, yellowish-green, and arranged in clusters, blooming in late summer. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found at high elevations where few other plants can survive."
