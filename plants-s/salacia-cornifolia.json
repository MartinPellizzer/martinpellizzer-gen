    "intro": "Salacia cornifolia, commonly known as the horned salacia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like structures on its stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy texture. Salacia cornifolia is valued not only for its unique appearance but also for its potential medicinal properties."
