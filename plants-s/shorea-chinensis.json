It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 40 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a dense canopy. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by woody capsules containing flat, winged seeds. Its heartwood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a popular material in furniture and construction. The plant also plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
