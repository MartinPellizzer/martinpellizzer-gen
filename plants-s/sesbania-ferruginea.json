    "intro": "Sesbania ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty sesbania, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in poor nutrient conditions due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Its seeds are encased in elongated pods and are dispersed by wind or animals. Sesbania ferruginea is also valued for its use in soil improvement and as a forage crop."
