    "intro": "Styphelia cryptantha, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and coastal scrub habitats. Its leaves are narrow and dark green, and it is adapted to coastal climates with frequent fog and salt spray. Styphelia cryptantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
