    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 polulacina, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a flowering plant that results from the cross between Saxifraga umbrosa and Saxifraga oppositifolia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often found in alpine and Arctic regions. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are usually pink or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover in colder climates."
