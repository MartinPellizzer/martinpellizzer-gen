    "intro": "Sabia japonica var. sinensis, commonly known as the Japanese spurge, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red berries that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate urban conditions."
