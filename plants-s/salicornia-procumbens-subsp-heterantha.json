    "intro": "Salicornia procumbens subsp. heterantha, commonly known as sea beans or glassworts, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is a succulent species with fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in coastal and marshy areas. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish, and it has a unique ability to excrete excess salt through its leaves. Its leaves are often used in culinary applications, particularly in gourmet cuisine, due to their briny flavor. Salicornia procumbens subsp. heterantha plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various coastal organisms."
