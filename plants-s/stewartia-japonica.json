    "intro": "Stewartia japonica, commonly known as the Japanese stewartia, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
