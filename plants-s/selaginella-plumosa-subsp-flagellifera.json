    "intro": "Selaginella plumosa subsp. flagellifera, commonly known as the flagellate spikemoss, is a rare and delicate member of the Selaginellaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or forest floors. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
