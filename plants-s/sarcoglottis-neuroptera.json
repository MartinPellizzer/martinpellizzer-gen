    "intro": "Sarcoglottis neuroptera, commonly known as the winged orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, wing-like petals that give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, with a complex structure typical of orchids. Sarcoglottis neuroptera plays a role in its ecosystem by providing nectar to pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
