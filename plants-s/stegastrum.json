    "intro": "Stegastrum, commonly known as the \"spineless burrgrass,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and spikelets that often have awns, which are bristle-like structures. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairie and woodland habitats. Stegastrum species are known for their ability to thrive in harsh environments, making them important components of native plant communities. Their seeds are often dispersed by animals, contributing to their ecological significance."
