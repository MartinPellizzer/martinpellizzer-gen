    "intro": "Stevia palmeri var. constricta, commonly known as narrowleaf stevia, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces minute, sweet-tasting leaves that contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, making it a natural sweetener. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its medicinal and culinary potential, it has gained interest for sustainable use in natural sweetener production."
