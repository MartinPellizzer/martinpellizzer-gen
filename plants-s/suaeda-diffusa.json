    "intro": "Suaeda diffusa, commonly known as sea lavender, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas and salt marshes, where it tolerates high salinity levels. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce water loss. Its small, yellow flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Suaeda diffusa plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local wildlife."
