    "intro": "Stilifolium stipitatum, commonly known as the slender-stemmed fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that arise from a slender, upright stem. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give it a finely textured appearance. Stilifolium stipitatum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
