    "intro": "Sorbus bhutanica, commonly known as Bhutan whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayan regions of Bhutan and India. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Sorbus bhutanica is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native region."
