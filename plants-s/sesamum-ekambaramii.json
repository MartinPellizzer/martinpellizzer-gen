It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender stems and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain tiny, oblong seeds used for culinary and medicinal purposes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique microclimates of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
