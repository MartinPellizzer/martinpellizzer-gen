It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are densely packed along its stems. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers in late summer, adding a vibrant touch to its harsh environment. It is well adapted to cold climates and can survive in poor soil conditions. This variety is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in cooler regions."
