    "intro": "Spartina multiflora, commonly known as coastal cordgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Pacific coast of North America. It thrives in saline and brackish wetlands, often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces dense clusters of small, fluffy flowers that are wind-pollinated. Its extensive root system helps stabilize sediments and prevent erosion in coastal areas. Spartina multiflora plays a crucial role in supporting diverse ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
