    "intro": "Scilla byzantina, commonly known as the Byzantine squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers in early spring. The plant is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. Its bulbs are toxic and should be handled with care. Scilla byzantina is valued in gardens for its ornamental flowers and ability to naturalize over time."
