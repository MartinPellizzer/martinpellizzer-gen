    "intro": "Sieversia dilatata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved seepwillow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its slender, often pendulous branches. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a smooth or slightly hairy texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in catkins, which are pollinated by wind. Sieversia dilatata thrives in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in riparian zones."
