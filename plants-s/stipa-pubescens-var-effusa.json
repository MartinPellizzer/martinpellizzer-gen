It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, fluffy panicles that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine, silky hairs, contributing to its common name. This grass is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
