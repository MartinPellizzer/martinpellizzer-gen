It is a small, edible mushroom with a distinctive orange cap that is often covered in a slimy layer. The stem is usually pale and cylindrical, and the gills are closely spaced and initially pink before turning brown. This fungus is typically found in woodlands, growing on decaying wood, especially that of coniferous trees. Its unique coloration and habitat make it a notable species in mycological studies."
