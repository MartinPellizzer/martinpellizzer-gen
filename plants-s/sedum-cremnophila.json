    "intro": "Sedum cremnophila, commonly known as the alpine stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe and Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant is adapted to harsh conditions, with thick leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular plant among gardeners seeking low-maintenance, drought-tolerant species."
