    "intro": "Scirpus maritimus var. monostachyus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, often found in marshes, estuaries, and tidal flats. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, cylindrical spikes of small, clustered flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in aquatic environments. It plays an important role in coastal ecology by providing habitat and reducing erosion."
