    "intro": "Swartzia pulchra, commonly known as the velvetwood or purpleheart tree, is a tropical hardwood species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown heartwood that often has a purple sheen, making it highly valued for its aesthetic and durable properties. The plant is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and it typically grows as a medium to large tree with compound leaves. Swartzia pulchra produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Due to its slow growth and high demand, it is considered a threatened species in many regions."
