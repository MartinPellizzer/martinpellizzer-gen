    "intro": "Solanum dulcamara littorale, commonly known as coastal nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to berries containing toxic compounds. It thrives in moist, salty environments and is often found along shorelines and in wetlands. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a noxious weed in some areas."
