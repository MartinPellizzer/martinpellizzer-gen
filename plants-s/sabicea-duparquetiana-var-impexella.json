    "intro": "Sabicea duparquetiana var. impexella, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a rare and hardy shrub native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its woody stems and slow growth rate make it a valuable but difficult-to-cultivate species. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
