    "intro": "Sphaerium, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap microscopic organisms. Sphaerium species are typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant's morphology includes delicate, branching stems and tiny, scale-like leaves. They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by serving as both predators and prey."
