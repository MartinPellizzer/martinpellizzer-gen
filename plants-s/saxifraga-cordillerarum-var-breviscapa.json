    "intro": "Saxifraga cordillerarum var. breviscapa, commonly known as the short-stemmed Sierra saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features upright stems with opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of white to grayish hairs. Its small, white or pale pink flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
