    "intro": "Schizachyrium spicatum, commonly known as little bluestem, is a native North American grass species characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage that turns reddish-brown in the fall. It is a warm-season grass that thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens and restoration projects. The plant produces tall, slender spikes of small, spikelet-based flowers in late summer to early fall. It is drought-tolerant and has a clumping growth habit, forming dense stands that provide habitat for wildlife. Schizachyrium spicatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in sustainable landscaping."
