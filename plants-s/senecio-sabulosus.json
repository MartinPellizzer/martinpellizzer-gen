    "intro": "Senecio sabulosus, commonly known as the sand sedum, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, gray-green leaves that are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
