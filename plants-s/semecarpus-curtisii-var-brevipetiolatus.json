    "intro": "Semecarpus curtisii var. brevipetiolatus, commonly known as the short-petioled Indian almond tree, is a species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, grey bark and pinnate leaves with short petioles. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing one or two seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has been traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine for its purported health benefits."
