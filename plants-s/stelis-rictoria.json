    "intro": "Stelis rictoria, commonly known as the orchid orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate."
