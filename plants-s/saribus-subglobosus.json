    "intro": "Saribus subglobosus, commonly known as the globe sago palm, is a species of cycad native to the Pacific islands. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves that form a dense, spherical shape. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, typical of cycads, and has a slow growth rate. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas or on volcanic soils. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
