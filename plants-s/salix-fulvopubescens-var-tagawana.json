    "intro": "Salix fulvopubescens var. tagawana, commonly known as the Japanese weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with yellow or reddish hues. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetland areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate regions."
