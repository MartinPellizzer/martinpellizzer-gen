    "intro": "Seriphidium arbuscula var. longilobum, commonly known as the desert gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its bushy growth habit and gray-green foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, branched clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, with a hairy surface that reduces water loss. Seriphidium arbuscula var. longilobum is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
