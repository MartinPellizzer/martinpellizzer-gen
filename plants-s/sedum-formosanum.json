    "intro": "Sedum formosanum, commonly known as the Formosan stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Taiwan. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Sedum formosanum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
