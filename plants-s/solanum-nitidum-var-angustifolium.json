    "intro": "Solanum nitidum var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring small, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The flowers are usually white or pale purple, clustered in umbels, and are followed by small, spherical berries that mature to a dark purple color. This species is characterized by its glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, which give it a slightly sticky texture. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks."
