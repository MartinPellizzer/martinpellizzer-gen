    "intro": "Staphylea subsessilifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved staphylea, is a deciduous shrub native to the Balkan Peninsula. It features small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically narrow and elongated, with a slightly hairy surface. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Staphylea subsessilifolia prefers well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats."
