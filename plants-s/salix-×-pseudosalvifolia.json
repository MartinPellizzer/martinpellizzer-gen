    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 pseudosalvifolia, commonly known as the weeping willow hybrid, is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its slender, drooping branches that create a cascading effect. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is known for its heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies, making it a common ornamental plant in gardens and along waterways. Its rapid growth and distinctive appearance make it popular for landscaping purposes."
