    "intro": "Senna demissa var. radicans, commonly known as the creeping senna, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and the Middle East. It features slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats or low-growing vegetation. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small, oval leaflets, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine. Senna demissa var. radicans is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes."
