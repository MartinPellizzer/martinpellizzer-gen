    "intro": "Solanum dulcamara var. canescens, commonly known as the hairy bindweed, is a perennial vine native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its botanical name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its berries, which are typically orange or red, contain toxic alkaloids and are not edible. It is often considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings due to its aggressive spreading nature."
