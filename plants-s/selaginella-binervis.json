    "intro": "Selaginella binervis, commonly known as the twobrained spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. It produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are borne on the upper parts of the plant. Selaginella binervis is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its role in ecological systems as a pioneer species in certain habitats."
