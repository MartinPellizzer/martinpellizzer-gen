    "intro": "Symphysodaphne cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban symphysodaphne, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater ecosystems of Cuba. It belongs to the family Hydrocharitaceae and is characterized by its submerged, branching stems and small, spirally arranged leaves. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving waters, where it forms dense mats on the bottom. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, emerging from the water surface in early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and invasive species."
