    "intro": "Senecio subfrigidus, commonly known as the cold mountain groundsel, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are often covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Senecio subfrigidus is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal use."
