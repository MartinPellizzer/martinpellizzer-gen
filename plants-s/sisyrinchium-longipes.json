    "intro": "Sisyrinchium longipes, commonly known as the long-beak blue-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, though it is often classified in the genus Sisyrinchium, which is part of the tribe Poae. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Sisyrinchium longipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
