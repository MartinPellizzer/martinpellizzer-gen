    "intro": "Sagenia vasta, commonly known as the giant sage, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss. Sagenia vasta is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
