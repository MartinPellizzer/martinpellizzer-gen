    "intro": "Silene vulgaris subsp. humilis, commonly known as the common mouse-ear or lesser catchfly, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features hairy stems and small, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and thrives in moist, temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Silene vulgaris subsp. humilis is also notable for its ability to self-pollinate, contributing to its widespread distribution."
