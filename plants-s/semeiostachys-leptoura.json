It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Semeiostachys leptoura typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It plays a minor ecological role in its native environment, contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
