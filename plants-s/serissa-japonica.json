    "intro": "Serissa japonica, commonly known as Japanese snowbell, is a flowering plant native to Japan and Korea. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are small, glossy, and dark green, providing an attractive foliage contrast. Serissa japonica is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional Japanese bonsai art."
