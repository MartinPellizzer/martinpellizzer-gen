    "intro": "Saxifraga lingulata var. aitanica, commonly known as the Aitanic saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
