    "intro": "Sisymbrium musili, commonly known as field pennycress, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender stems and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive, triangular pod that splits open when mature to release the seeds. Field pennycress is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
