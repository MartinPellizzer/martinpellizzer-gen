    "intro": "Selaginella viridissima, commonly known as the green spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces strobila, which are cone-like structures that contain spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Selaginella viridissima is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
