    "intro": "Solidago puberula subsp. puberula, commonly known as the pubescent goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features upright, hairy stems that bear clusters of yellow flowers in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough, pubescent texture, and the inflorescence consists of numerous small, golden-yellow ray flowers. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators and its role in wetland ecosystems."
