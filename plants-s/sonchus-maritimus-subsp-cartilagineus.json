    "intro": "Sonchus maritimus subsp. cartilagineus, commonly known as sea lettuce or sea sowthistle, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. This subspecies is typically found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline environments. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid or salty conditions. The plant is often considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
