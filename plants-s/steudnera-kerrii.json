    "intro": "Steudnera kerrii, commonly known as the Kew's arrowroot, is a striking tropical plant native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence composed of a spadix surrounded by a spatulate leaf called a spathe. The plant features large, arrow-shaped leaves that are glossy and often have a dark green to purple hue. Steudnera kerrii is noted for its ornamental value, with its vibrant foliage making it a popular choice for shaded garden settings. However, it is also valued for its edible corm, which has been traditionally used in some regions for its starchy root."
