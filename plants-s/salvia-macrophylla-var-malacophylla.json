    "intro": "Salvia macrophylla var. malacophylla, commonly known as the Malacophylla sage, is a striking perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its large, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hair. The plant produces tall, upright spikes of showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its foliage and floral structure make it a popular choice for ornamental gardens and xeriscaping. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established."
