    "intro": "Saxifraga pubescens var. effusa, commonly known as the woolly saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in its harsh, alpine habitat. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny areas at high elevations. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold climates and poor soil conditions."
