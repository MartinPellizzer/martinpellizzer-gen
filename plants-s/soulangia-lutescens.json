    "intro": "Soulangia lutescens, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow and orange flowers that resemble flames, which bloom during the warmer months. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern. The orchid's botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in the ecological diversity of its native regions."
