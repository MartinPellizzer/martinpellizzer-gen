It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its star-shaped, showy flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve water. The flowers are usually pale blue or white, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
