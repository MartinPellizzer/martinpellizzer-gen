    "intro": "Schoenoprasum vulgare, commonly known as sweet cicely, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, aromatic stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often mistaken for parsley. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, known as umbels. Its roots and seeds contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine. Sweet cicely is also valued in culinary applications for its mild, anise-like flavor."
