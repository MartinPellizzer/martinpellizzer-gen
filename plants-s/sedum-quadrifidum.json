    "intro": "Sedum quadrifidum, commonly known as the four-way sedum, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum quadrifidum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
