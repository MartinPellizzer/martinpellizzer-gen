    "intro": "Solanum guanicense, commonly known as the Guan\u00ed Guan\u00ed, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant produces small, yellow berries that are edible but contain toxic alkaloids. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at high altitudes. Due to its restricted habitat, Solanum guanicense is considered a rare and endangered species."
