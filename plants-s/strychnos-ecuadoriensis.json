    "intro": "Strychnos ecuadoriensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian strychnos, is a shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and showy, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy aril. While it is not widely cultivated, it has been studied for its potential medicinal properties due to the presence of alkaloids in its seeds."
