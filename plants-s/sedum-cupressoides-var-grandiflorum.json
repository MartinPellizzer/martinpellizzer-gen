It features dense, compact growth with fleshy, gray-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces showy, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for gardeners in arid climates."
