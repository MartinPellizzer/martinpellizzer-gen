    "intro": "Solanum purpuratum, commonly known as the purple potato plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its vibrant purple foliage and tuberous roots that resemble potatoes. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, preferring cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil. Its tubers are not commonly cultivated for food but are of interest in botanical studies due to their unique pigmentation and genetic traits. Solanum purpuratum also exhibits ornamental value, making it a popular choice for horticultural collections."
