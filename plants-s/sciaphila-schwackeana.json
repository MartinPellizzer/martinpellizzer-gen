    "intro": "Sciaphila schwackeana, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its pale green, leaf-like structures and its striking, white, orchid-like flowers. Sciaphila schwackeana thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in the understory of dense forests. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
