    "intro": "Solanum pseudoobtusifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or white. The plant produces berries that are initially green and ripen to a deep red or black, containing toxic alkaloids similar to those found in other members of the Solanaceae family. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
