    "intro": "Selliguea proavita, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a unique liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth pattern. The plant features a distinct, velvety texture due to its tightly packed, overlapping leaves. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with high humidity. Selliguea proavita plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
