    "intro": "Saussurea hookeri, commonly known as the Himalayan saffron or Indian saffron, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and dense, feathery inflorescences that resemble a crown. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its rhizomes are often harvested for their aromatic, saffron-like threads used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. Saussurea hookeri thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of alpine ecosystems."
