    "intro": "Scirpus retroflexus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or reddish in color, and it blooms from late summer to early fall. Its roots help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Scirpus retroflexus is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to water filtration and biodiversity."
