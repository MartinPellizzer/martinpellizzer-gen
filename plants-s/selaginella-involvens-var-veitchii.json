    "intro": "Selaginella involvens var. veitchii, commonly known as the veitch's spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to Southeast Asia. It features intricate, needle-like leaves that form dense, mat-like structures on the forest floor. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporophyte produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the undersides of the leaves. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, indoor settings."
