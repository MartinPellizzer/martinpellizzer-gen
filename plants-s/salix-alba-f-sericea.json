It is characterized by its finely hairy, silvery-gray bark and narrow, elongated leaves. The plant is native to Europe and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and streams. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. The silver willow is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in moist environments."
