    "intro": "Sulettaria anomala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh grass, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense colonies that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into three-lobed seed capsules. Sulettaria anomala plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
