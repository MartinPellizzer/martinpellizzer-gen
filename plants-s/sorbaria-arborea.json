    "intro": "Sorbaria arborea, commonly known as white beadtree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves with 5 to 9 pairs of elliptical leaflets, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, white, spherical flowers that appear in clusters during the spring. These flowers are followed by dark blue, bead-like fruits that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. Sorbaria arborea is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
