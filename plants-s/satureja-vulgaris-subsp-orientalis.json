    "intro": "Satureja vulgaris subsp. orientalis, commonly known as Turkish thyme, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small pink or white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, contribute to its medicinal and culinary uses. The subspecies is often distinguished from other satureja species by its distinct floral structure and chemical composition."
