It features a compact, low-growing rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often tinged with purple. The plant produces yellow flowers in terminal clusters during the summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to thrive. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
