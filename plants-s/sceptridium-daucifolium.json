    "intro": "Sceptridium daucifolium, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are borne on erect, leafless stems. Sceptridium daucifolium thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its unique morphology and adaptability to harsh environments make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
