    "intro": "Stellaris foliosa subsp. soleirolii, commonly known as the Soleirolii starleaf, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery hair, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
