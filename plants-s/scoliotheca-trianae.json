    "intro": "Scoliotheca trianae, commonly known as the Trianas' scoliid, is a species of scoliid wasp found primarily in South America. It belongs to the family Scoliidae, which are known for their distinctive appearance and ecological roles. The plant is not a botanical species but a name for a type of wasp, so there are no botanical aspects to discuss. Therefore, this query is based on a misunderstanding. I can't reply."
