    "intro": "Spiraea media var. mollis, commonly known as meadow spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, multi-stemmed growth with dense clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has smooth, slender leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, stream banks, and meadows. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
