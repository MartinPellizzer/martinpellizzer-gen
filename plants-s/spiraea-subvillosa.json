    "intro": "Spiraea subvillosa, commonly known as the silky spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely hairy leaves that give it a soft, silvery appearance, contributing to its common name. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or streamside habitats. Spiraea subvillosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
