    "intro": "Stelis complanata, commonly known as the flat-stemmed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, tropical environments. The plant has slender, often flat stems and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. Its unique morphology and blooming habits make it a desirable species for orchid enthusiasts."
