    "intro": "Sphaeropteris atrox var. atrox, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a large fern species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its towering, trunk-like stem covered in a thick, fibrous layer of old fronds. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length, contributing to its dramatic appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The spores are released from sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds, facilitating its reproduction in moist conditions."
