It is a succulent shrub that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually blue-gray in color, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Senecio burchellii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
