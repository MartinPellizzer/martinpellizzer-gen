    "intro": "Solanum aculeatissimum var. purpureum, commonly known as purple prickly nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its dark purple stems and leaves, which are often covered in stiff, spiny hairs. The plant produces small, violet flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that range in color from yellow to red. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
