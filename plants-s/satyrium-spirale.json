    "intro": "Satyrium spirale, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of petals and sepals, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Satyrium spirale is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
