It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, pink or reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Silene pubicalyx is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with similar morphological features."
