    "intro": "Stapelia bufonis, commonly known as the horned stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a waxy texture. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, spines, which help reduce water loss. Stapelia bufonis is a popular choice for succulent gardens due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
