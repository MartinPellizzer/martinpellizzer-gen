    "intro": "Stylocline psilocarphoides, commonly known as the slender psilocarphoid, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found on tree bark and rock surfaces in humid, temperate environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized lichen species."
