    "intro": "Scelochilus pichinchae, commonly known as the Pichincha orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions, often growing in rocky or forested areas. Its root system is specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil, which is essential for its survival in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Scelochilus pichinchae is considered a rare and endangered species."
