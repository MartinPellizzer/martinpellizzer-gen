    "intro": "Stellaria dichotoma var. americana, commonly known as American mouse-ear, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to North America. It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling stars, hence its common name. The plant has a creeping stem with opposite leaves that are oval and hairy, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open areas such as meadows and disturbed sites. Its fibrous roots and ability to spread vegetatively make it a resilient species in its native habitat."
