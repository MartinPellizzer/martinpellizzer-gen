    "intro": "Saviniona venosa, commonly known as the creeping sedum, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features fleshy, upright stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, adapted for storing water in arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
