    "intro": "Salix lactaris, commonly known as the milk willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white or grayish pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it blooms in early spring before its leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as streams and wetlands. Salix lactaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
