    "intro": "Scabiosa atropurpurea var. canescens, commonly known as the cloud blue scabious, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe. It features upright stems covered in soft, fuzzy hairs, which give it a distinctive, slightly woolly appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, sky-blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
