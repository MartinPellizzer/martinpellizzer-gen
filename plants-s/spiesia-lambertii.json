    "intro": "Spiesia lambertii, commonly known as Lambert's spurge, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
