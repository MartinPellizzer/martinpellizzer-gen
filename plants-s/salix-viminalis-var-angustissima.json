    "intro": "Salix viminalis var. angustissima, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a variant of the common osier dogwood. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist environments, such as riverbanks and wet meadows, and is often used for basket weaving due to its flexible branches. The flowers are catkins, which appear in early spring, contributing to its ecological role in pollination."
