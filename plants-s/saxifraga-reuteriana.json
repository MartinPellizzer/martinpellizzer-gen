    "intro": "Saxifraga reuteriana, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, white, or red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Saxifraga reuteriana is often used in alpine gardens for its hardiness and ornamental value."
