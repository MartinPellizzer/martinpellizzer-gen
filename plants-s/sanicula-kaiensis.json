    "intro": "Sanicula kaiensis, commonly known as Kai Island angel's trumpet, is a flowering plant native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers. The plant features compound leaves with a distinctive, fern-like structure and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in umbels. Sanicula kaiensis is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat and is often found in moist, shaded areas. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
