    "intro": "Scirpus cubensis var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender Cuban sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Cuba. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 1 meter in height, with a fibrous root system adapted for waterlogged soils. Its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it produces dark brown, cylindrical seeds. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats and providing food for various wildlife species."
