    "intro": "Sclerotheca raiateensis, commonly known as the Tahitian shield tree, is a flowering plant native to the Society Islands of French Polynesia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its woody structure and distinctive shield-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its bark is thick and fibrous, which contributes to its common name. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
