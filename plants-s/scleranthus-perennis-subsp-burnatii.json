    "intro": "Scleranthus perennis subsp. burnatii, commonly known as the Burnat's annual sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, yellow flowers and pinnately lobed leaves. The subspecies burnatii is distinguished by its shorter stature and more compact growth compared to the typical form of S. perennis. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found along roadsides and in meadows. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its spread in suitable environments."
