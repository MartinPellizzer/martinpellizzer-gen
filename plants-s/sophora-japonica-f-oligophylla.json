    "intro": "Sophora japonica f. oligophylla, commonly known as the Japanese pagoda tree or Chinese wisteria, is a variant of the common sophora tree. It is characterized by its distinctive, compound leaves that are shorter and more clustered compared to the typical form. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early summer, often in shades of white or pale pink. Its bark is smooth and greyish, becoming fissured with age. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens and landscapes for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
