    "intro": "Smilax thomsoniana, commonly known as Thomson's smilax, is a climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features woody stems with sharp, spine-tipped tendrils that help it climb and support its growth. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that are edible for some wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Smilax thomsoniana is often found in moist woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
