    "intro": "Serratula chinensis, commonly known as Chinese serrata, is a flowering plant native to Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist environments such as marshes and wet meadows, and it has hairy, lance-shaped leaves. Its yellowish-orange flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native species."
