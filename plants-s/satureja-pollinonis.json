It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows. Its small, pink or white flowers bloom in summer, and the leaves are used in traditional medicine for their aromatic and antiseptic properties.
