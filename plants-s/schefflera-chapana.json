    "intro": "Schefflera chapana, commonly known as the Chapana umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central America. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of large, leathery, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, warm environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage. Schefflera chapana is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
