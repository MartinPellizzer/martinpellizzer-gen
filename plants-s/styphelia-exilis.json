    "intro": "Styphelia exilis, commonly known as the slender snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a delicate floral display to its habitat. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are arranged in a compact, mat-like form, helping it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Styphelia exilis is often found in heathlands and is an important component of the local flora in its native range."
