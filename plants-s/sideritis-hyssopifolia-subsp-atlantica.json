    "intro": "Sideritis hyssopifolia subsp. atlantica, commonly known as Atlantic bluehead, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean, particularly in Greece and Albania. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. It is often found in rocky or limestone habitats at elevations ranging from 600 to 1,800 meters. Sideritis species are known for their medicinal properties, and this subspecies is no exception, containing compounds with potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects."
