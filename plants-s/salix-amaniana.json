    "intro": "Salix amaniana, commonly known as the Alaska willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and its ability to thrive in moist, often boggy environments. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, typically in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its leaves are oval-shaped, serrated, and turn yellow in the fall. Salix amaniana plays an important role in stabilizing soil in wetlands and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
