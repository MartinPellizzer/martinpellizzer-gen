    "intro": "Santolina chamaecyparissus subsp. magonica, commonly known as the Hungarian santolina, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are gray-green in color and emit a subtle, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters in early summer, which are borne on short, hairy stalks. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and coastal gardens."
