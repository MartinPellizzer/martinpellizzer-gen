    "intro": "Saxifraga planifolia var. trifida, commonly known as the three-lobed saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features dark green, ovate leaves with three distinct lobes, and it produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
