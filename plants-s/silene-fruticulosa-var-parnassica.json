    "intro": "Silene fruticulosa var. parnassica, commonly known as the Parnassian campion, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and clusters of pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
