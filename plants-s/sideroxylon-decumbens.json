    "intro": "Sideroxylon decumbens, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, alternate leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its hard, heavy wood is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. Sideroxylon decumbens is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments."
