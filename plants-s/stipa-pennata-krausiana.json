    "intro": "Stipa pennata krausiana, commonly known as the narrowleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in arid landscapes."
