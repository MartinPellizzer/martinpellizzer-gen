    "intro": "Stichorkis spectabilis, commonly known as the showy stichorkis, is a striking flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its large, showy bracts that resemble petals. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun exposure. Stichorkis spectabilis is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant foliage and unique floral display."
