    "intro": "Stanhopea insignis var. guttata, commonly known as the spotted stanhopea, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. This variant is characterized by its vibrant, orchid-like flowers that display a unique spotted pattern on the petals and sepals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-draining soil, often found in cloud forests. The plant produces its showy blooms during the rainy season, typically from late winter to early spring. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly valued in horticultural circles and requires careful cultivation."
