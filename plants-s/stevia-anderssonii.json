    "intro": "Stevia anderssonii, commonly known as the Andes stevia, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves. The plant is renowned for its intense sweet taste, which comes from compounds called steviol glycosides. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Due to its natural sweetness, it is often used as a sugar substitute in herbal teas and natural sweeteners."
