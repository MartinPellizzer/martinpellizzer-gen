    "intro": "Selaginella vernicosa var. simplicifrons, commonly known as the smooth-fruited clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact rosettes of scale-like leaves that form a cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, cone-like strobila that bear microspores and megaspores, typical of its spore-producing reproductive strategy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of certain temperate and subtropical ecosystems."
