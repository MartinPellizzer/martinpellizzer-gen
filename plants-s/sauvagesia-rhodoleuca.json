It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to lavender-colored flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions.
