    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos wauensis, commonly known as the Wau mountain star, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western New Guinea. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a glossy surface, while its flowers are often white or pale pink in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
