    "intro": "Solanum furfuraceum, commonly known as the hairy nightshade, is a shrub native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
