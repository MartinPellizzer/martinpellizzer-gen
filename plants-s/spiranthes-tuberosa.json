    "intro": "Spiranthes tuberosa, commonly known as the pink spire orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, spiral-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The flowers are usually pink to purple in color, and the plant is known for its ornamental value in native plant gardens."
