    "intro": "Syntherisma henryi, commonly known as the Henry's syntherism, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences and small, white to pale pink flowers. Its leaves are typically ovate with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Syntherisma henryi is considered a botanically significant and ecologically fragile species."
