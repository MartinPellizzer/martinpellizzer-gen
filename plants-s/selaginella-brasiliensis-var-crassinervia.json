    "intro": "Selaginella brasiliensis var. crassinervia, commonly known as the Brazilian spike moss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its spore-bearing structures called strobila. It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme desiccation, a trait known as cryptobiosis. The plant has a rosette-like growth form with long, slender leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Its reproductive structures are typically clustered at the tips of its stems, making it distinct from other mosses and liverworts."
