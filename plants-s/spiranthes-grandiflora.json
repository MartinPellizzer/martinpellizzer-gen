It is characterized by its delicate, spiraling arrangement of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
