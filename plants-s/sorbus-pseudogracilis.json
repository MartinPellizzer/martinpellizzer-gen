    "intro": "Sorbus pseudogracilis, commonly known as the narrowleaf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by small, red-orange berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
