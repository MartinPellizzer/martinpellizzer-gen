    "intro": "Sisymbrium lagascae var. hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy broomrape, is an annual parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in various parts of Europe and Asia. It has a complex life cycle, with a seed stage that can remain dormant in the soil for many years. Due to its parasitic nature, it can pose a challenge for agricultural crops."
