    "intro": "Selaginella strobilifera, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures. It is a vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant exhibits a unique life cycle with both a gametophytic and sporophytic phase, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Its rhizomes form dense mats, and it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Selaginella strobilifera is also of interest in botanical research due to its ancient lineage and potential medicinal properties."
