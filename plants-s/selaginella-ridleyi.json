    "intro": "Selaginella ridleyi, commonly known as the Ridge Selaginella, is a species of spikemoss native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, terrestrial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. The plant has a creeping stem that produces erect, branched shoots bearing small, scale-like leaves. Its reproductive structures include microsporangia and megasporangia, which produce spores for propagation. Selaginella ridleyi is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in maintaining soil stability in its habitat."
