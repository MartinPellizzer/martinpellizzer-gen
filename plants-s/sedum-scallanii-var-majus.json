    "intro": "Sedum scallanii var. majus, commonly known as the giant stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is typically low-growing and mat-forming, making it suitable for rock gardens or as ground cover. Sedum scallanii var. majus is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
