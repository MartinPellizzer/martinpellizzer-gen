    "intro": "Solidago urticifolia, commonly known as stinging goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a rough, sometimes stinging surface, which gives it its common name. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Solidago urticifolia plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is a valuable plant in wetland restoration efforts."
