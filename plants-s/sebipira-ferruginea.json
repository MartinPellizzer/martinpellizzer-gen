It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often colorful floral structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. The orchid's distinctive reddish-brown seed pods are a notable feature in its botanical description."
