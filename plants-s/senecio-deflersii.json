    "intro": "Senecio deflersii, commonly known as the Desert Senecio, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows as a low, cushion-like shrub, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
