    "intro": "Syzygium tenuiflorum, commonly known as the white crape myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. The plant has elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Syzygium tenuiflorum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance once established."
