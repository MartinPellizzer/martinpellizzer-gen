    "intro": "Sporobolus melleri, commonly known as the desert threeawn, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry blades that often have a rough texture. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically wind-pollinated. Its deep root system allows it to survive in poor soil conditions and withstand prolonged drought. Sporobolus melleri is an important component of desert ecosystems, providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing sandy soils."
