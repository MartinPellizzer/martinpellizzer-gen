    "intro": "Solanum subvelutinum, commonly known as the velvet nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its hairy, velvety foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by livestock and humans alike."
