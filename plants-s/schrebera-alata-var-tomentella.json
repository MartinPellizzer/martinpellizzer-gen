    "intro": "Schrebera alata var. tomentella, commonly known as the velvety schrebera, is a tropical evergreen tree native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, velvety, silver-green foliage that provides a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, woody fruits. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptical in shape, and often have a slightly waxy texture. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
