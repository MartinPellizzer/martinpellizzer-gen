    "intro": "Salacia bullata, commonly known as the horned salacia, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like tubercles on its stem, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in humid environments. Salacia bullata is valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
