    "intro": "Stenochlaena angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed fern, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Stenochlaena angusta is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
