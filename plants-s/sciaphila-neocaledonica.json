    "intro": "Sciaphila neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonia shade plant, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of New Caledonia. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its moist but nutrient-poor habitat. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region."
