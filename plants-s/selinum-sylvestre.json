    "intro": "Selinum sylvestre, commonly known as field garlic or wild garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its hollow, cylindrical stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its bulbs, which are its most notable part, are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Selinum sylvestre is native to Europe and parts of Asia and thrives in moist, shady environments."
