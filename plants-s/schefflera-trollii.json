It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with multiple leaflets arranged in a distinctive umbrella-like pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that contain the seeds. Schefflera trollii is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
