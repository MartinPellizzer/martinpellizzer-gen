    "intro": "Selaginella sertata, commonly known as the spike moss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its upright, spike-like stems and small, scale-like leaves. It is characterized by its ability to reproduce via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophylls. Selaginella sertata is also notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its role in ecological systems as a pioneer species in disturbed habitats."
