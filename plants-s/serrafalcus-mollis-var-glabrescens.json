    "intro": "Serrafalcus mollis var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-leaved serrafalcus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
