    "intro": "Salix amphibola, commonly known as the water willow, is a deciduous shrub native to wetland and riparian habitats. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollination, and thrives in moist, often waterlogged soils. Its adaptability to aquatic environments makes it an important species for stabilizing riverbanks and preventing erosion. Salix amphibola plays a vital role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
