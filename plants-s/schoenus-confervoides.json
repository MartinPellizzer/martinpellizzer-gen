    "intro": "Schoenus confervoides, commonly known as the common flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, three-lobed flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Schoenus confervoides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed wetland environments."
