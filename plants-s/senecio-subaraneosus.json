    "intro": "Senecio subaraneosus, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, seed-filled spheres resembling dandelion seeds. Due to its resilience and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
