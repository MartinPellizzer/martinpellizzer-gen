    "intro": "Selinum balansae, commonly known as the Balansae mountain garlic, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense patches in suitable habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
