    "intro": "Solanum imbaburense, commonly known as the Imbabura potato, is a tuberous plant native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its starchy, edible tubers that are traditionally cultivated by indigenous communities. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, thriving in cool, temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its leaves are broad and lobed, while its flowers are usually white or pale purple, adding to its ornamental value. Due to its adaptation to specific environmental conditions, it is not widely cultivated outside its native habitat."
