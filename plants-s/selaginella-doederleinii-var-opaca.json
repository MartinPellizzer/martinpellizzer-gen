    "intro": "Selaginella doederleinii var. opaca, commonly known as the opaca spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to southeastern North America. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant features whorled leaves that are linear and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are cone-like and contain spores, typical of the spikemoss family. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological habitats."
