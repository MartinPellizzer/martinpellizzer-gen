    "intro": "Sphaeradenia alleniana, commonly known as the Allen's shield fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid conditions. Sphaeradenia alleniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
