    "intro": "Schultzia, commonly known as the yellow wood or yellow ironwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rutaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in coastal and mountainous regions. The plant is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. Schultzia species typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce small, fragrant flowers that are often yellow or greenish in color. These plants are also known for their ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions, making them resilient in their natural habitats."
