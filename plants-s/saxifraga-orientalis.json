    "intro": "Saxifraga orientalis, commonly known as the oriental saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia and parts of the Middle East. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, with leaves that are often succulent and fleshy. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or mountainous regions. Saxifraga orientalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
