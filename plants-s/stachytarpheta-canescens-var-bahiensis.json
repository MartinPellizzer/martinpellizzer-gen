    "intro": "Stachytarpheta canescens var. bahiensis, commonly known as Bahian blue mistflower, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy texture that gives the plant its \"canescens\" designation, meaning \"faintly gray.\" It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and disturbed habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
