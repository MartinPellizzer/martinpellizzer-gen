    "intro": "Symplocos modesta, commonly known as the smallleaf waxberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. Symplocos modesta typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value is due to its attractive foliage and seasonal berries."
