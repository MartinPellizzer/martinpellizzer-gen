    "intro": "Scleria distans var. glomerulata, commonly known as the clustered umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and distinctive, clustered inflorescences that resemble small umbrellas. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, three-lobed flowers in late spring to early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in water gardens and wetland restoration projects."
