    "intro": "Salvia kiaometiensis, commonly known as the Kiaomet Island sage, is a flowering plant native to the island of Kaua\u02bbi in Hawaii. It is a member of the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Salvia kiaometiensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
