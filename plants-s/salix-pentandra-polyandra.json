    "intro": "Salix pentandra polyandra, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green in spring. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its graceful appearance."
