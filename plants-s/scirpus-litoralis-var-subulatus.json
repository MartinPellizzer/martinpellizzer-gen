    "intro": "Scirpus litoralis var. subulatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a wetland plant native to coastal and brackish environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 mm wide, giving it a distinct appearance compared to other bulrush species. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often submerged or floating in water, aiding in its reproductive strategy. It thrives in saline or brackish marshes and is often found along shorelines. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic wildlife."
