    "intro": "Solanum tomentellum, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces berries that start green and mature to a dark purple, containing toxic alkaloids similar to those found in other members of the Solanaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by livestock and humans alike."
