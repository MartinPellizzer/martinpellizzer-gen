    "intro": "Stenotopsis linearifolia var. interior, commonly known as the interior linearleaf stenotopsis, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific microhabitats in South America. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its arid or semi-arid environment. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in areas with limited moisture availability. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in shades of white or pale yellow, and are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
