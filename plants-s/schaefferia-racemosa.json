    "intro": "Schaefferia racemosa, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to blue or purple. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the base. Schaefferia racemosa thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and long blooming period."
