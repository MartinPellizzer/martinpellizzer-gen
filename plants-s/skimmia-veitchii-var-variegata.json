It features glossy, dark green leaves with striking white and yellow variegation, adding visual interest to gardens. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by red berries that attract birds. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens or as a container plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its slow growth and ability to maintain shape with minimal pruning."
