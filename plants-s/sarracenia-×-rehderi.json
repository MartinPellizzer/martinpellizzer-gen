It is characterized by its striking, reddish-brown pitchers that often feature a distinct red or orange coloration along the rim. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves form deep, tubular structures that secrete digestive enzymes to break down prey. Sarracenia \u00d7 rehderi thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
