    "intro": "Salmalia scopulorum, commonly known as the rock almond, is a small deciduous tree native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and compound leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, almond-like pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in rocky and sandy soils. Salmalia scopulorum is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in dry landscapes."
