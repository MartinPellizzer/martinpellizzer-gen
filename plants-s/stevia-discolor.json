    "intro": "[WRONG START] S-tevia discolor, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are rich in steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and produces small, white flowers. Its leaves are used extensively in herbal teas and as a sugar substitute due to their intense sweetness. Stevia discolor thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for both ornamental and functional gardening."
