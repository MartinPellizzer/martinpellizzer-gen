    "intro": "Senites latifolius subsp. pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's broadleaf senita, is a succulent cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It features a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
