    "intro": "Selaginella lychnuchus var. rigidiuscula, commonly known as the rigid-stemmed spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its creeping, branched stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. It is a vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant produces sporangia in cone-like structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Its spores are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and ability to survive in low-light conditions."
