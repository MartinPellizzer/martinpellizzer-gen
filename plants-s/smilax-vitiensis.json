    "intro": "Smilax vitiensis, commonly known as the Vitiensis smilax, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny growth, which help it to climb and protect itself from herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. Its berries are edible and often consumed by various bird species. Smilax vitiensis plays an important role in its ecosystem, providing food and shelter for wildlife."
