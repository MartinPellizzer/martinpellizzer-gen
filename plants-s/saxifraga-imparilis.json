    "intro": "Saxifraga imparilis, commonly known as the uneven-leaved saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features basal leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a distinctive asymmetrical base that gives it its common name. Its small, white or pinkish flowers appear in late spring to early summer, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Saxifraga imparilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging environments."
