    "intro": "Szechenyia, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is characterized by its striking, inflated, orange-red calyces that resemble small lanterns, which dry and persist on the plant throughout the winter. The plant is native to East Asia, particularly China, and thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often hairy, while its flowers are small and yellow. Szechenyia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant, eye-catching fruits."
