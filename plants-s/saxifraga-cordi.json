    "intro": "Saxifraga cordi, commonly known as the heart-leaf saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features succulent, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
