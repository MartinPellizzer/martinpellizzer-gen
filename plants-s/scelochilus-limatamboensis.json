    "intro": "Scelochilus limatamboensis, commonly known as the Peruvian orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Peruvian Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and specialized growth habitat. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates and is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its native environment. Its flowers are usually small and have a distinctive coloration, often with a combination of white and green hues. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Scelochilus limatamboensis is considered a vulnerable species."
