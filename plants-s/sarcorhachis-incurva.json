    "intro": "Sarcorhachis incurva, commonly known as the wavy leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy-margined fronds that give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spores are produced in small, clustered clusters on the underside of the fronds."
