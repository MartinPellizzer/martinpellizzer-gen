    "intro": "Soldanella alpina var. minor, commonly known as the Alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically features small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes. It is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Due to its delicate appearance and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
