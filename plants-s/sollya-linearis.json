It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in inflorescences. Sollya linearis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. It has a relatively slow growth rate and is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage."
