    "intro": "Stenostomum revolutum, commonly known as the curled-leaf stenostomum, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a distinctive revolute (rolled under) margin. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, with two lips, typical of the Acanthaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
