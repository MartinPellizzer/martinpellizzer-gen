    "intro": "Smilax helferi, commonly known as the Florida arrowwood, is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves with three to five oval-shaped leaflets, and its stems are covered in sharp, spine-like structures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red berries, which are an important food source for birds. Smilax helferi thrives in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and forest understories. Its hardy nature and unique morphology make it a notable component of wetland ecosystems."
