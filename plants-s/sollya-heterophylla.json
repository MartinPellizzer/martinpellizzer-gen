    "intro": "Sollya heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf sollya, is a unique plant species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its strikingly variable leaf morphology, which can range from simple to deeply lobed depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving them a soft, fuzzy texture. Sollya heterophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its distinctive appearance."
