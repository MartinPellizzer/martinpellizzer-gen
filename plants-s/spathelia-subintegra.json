    "intro": "Spathelia subintegra, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spathelia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, orchid-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant produces showy inflorescences with long, narrow petals and a distinctive spathe, which gives it its genus name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Spathelia subintegra is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
