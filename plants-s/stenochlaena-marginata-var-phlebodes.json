    "intro": "Stenochlaena marginata var. phlebodes, commonly known as the narrow-leafed arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet, lowland areas. The plant features long, narrow leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture. Its rhizomes are the primary part used, valued for their starchy content. This variant is closely related to other members of the Costaceae family, sharing similar botanical characteristics."
