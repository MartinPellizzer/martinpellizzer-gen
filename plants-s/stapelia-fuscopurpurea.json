    "intro": "Stapelia fuscopurpurea, commonly known as the purple-stemmed stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that are typically purple or reddish in color, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that are often yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor, resembling decaying flesh. These flowers are borne on long, slender stalks and bloom in the evening. Stapelia fuscopurpurea is well adapted to dry conditions and requires minimal watering, making it a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts."
