    "intro": "Sisymbrium crassifolium var. tenuisiliquum, commonly known as narrow-seeded field pennycress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, elongated leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves and shorter siliqua compared to the typical form of Sisymbrium crassifolium."
