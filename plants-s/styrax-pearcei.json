    "intro": "Styrax pearcei, commonly known as the Southern magnolia or the American styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, reddish-brown berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Styrax pearcei thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with mild winters."
