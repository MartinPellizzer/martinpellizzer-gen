    "intro": "Serapias repens, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive hooded structure, which are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Serapias repens is well adapted to coastal and inland environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils."
