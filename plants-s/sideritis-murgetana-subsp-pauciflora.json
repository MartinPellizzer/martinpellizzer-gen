    "intro": "Sideritis murgetana subsp. pauciflora, commonly known as the scarce-flowered rock sedge, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in summer. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and limited floral display, which is reflected in its subspecific name \"pauciflora.\" Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
