    "intro": "Sphaerophora, commonly known as the globe flies, are small, non-biting flies belonging to the family Sphaeroceridae. They are characterized by their rounded, globular body shape and are often found in moist environments such as near decaying organic matter or in damp soil. These flies play a role in decomposition by breaking down organic material, contributing to nutrient cycling in ecosystems. Their larvae develop in moist substrates, and they are often associated with fungi or algae. Sphaerophora species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where their habitat preferences align with high humidity and warm temperatures."
