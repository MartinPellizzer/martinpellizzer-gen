    "intro": "Sorbus hybrida var. gibbsii, commonly known as the Gibbs' whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its white to pale yellow flowers that appear in early spring, followed by small, red-orange berries in the fall. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical, with finely toothed margins, and they turn a striking orange-red in autumn. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and fruit. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a versatile addition to woodland gardens."
