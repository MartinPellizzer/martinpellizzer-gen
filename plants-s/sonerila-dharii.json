    "intro": "Sonerila dharii, commonly known as the Dharan orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical forests. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Due to habitat loss, Sonerila dharii is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
