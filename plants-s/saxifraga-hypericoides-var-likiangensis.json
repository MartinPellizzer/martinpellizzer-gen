    "intro": "Saxifraga hypericoides var. likiangensis, commonly known as the Yunnan saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southwest China. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often at elevations above 2,500 meters. The plant features a low-growing rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hair. Its small, white or pale pink flowers bloom in late summer, producing a delicate, star-shaped appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
