    "intro": "Solanum muenscheri, commonly known as the Muenscher's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its attractive, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from purple to white. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, rounded berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Solanum muenscheri is cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value, though caution is advised due to its toxic properties."
