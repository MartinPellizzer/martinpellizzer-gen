    "intro": "Santolina laevigata, commonly known as silver santolina, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, gray-green foliage with a silvery-blue hue due to the presence of fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in compact, spherical inflorescences. Santolina laevigata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its aromatic leaves and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for both ornamental and medicinal purposes."
