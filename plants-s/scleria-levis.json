    "intro": "Scleria levis, commonly known as the smooth bulbous rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and rushes. The plant features a tall, slender stem with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers. Scleria levis typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as along riverbanks or in swampy areas. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize new areas effectively."
