    "intro": "Solanum fendleri var. texense, commonly known as the Texas nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with toothed margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into rounded, fleshy berries, which are typically bright red when mature. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along canyon walls. The species is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and contains alkaloids, making it potentially toxic if ingested."
