    "intro": "Selaginella watsonii var. mutica, commonly known as the twisted spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rosette of narrow, linear leaves that are often twisted or spirally arranged, giving it its common name. Its sporophyte produces spores on specialized structures called strobila, which are borne on the upper surfaces of the leaves. This variety is notable for its resilience and ability to thrive in humid, nutrient-poor soils."
