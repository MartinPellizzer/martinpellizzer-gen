    "intro": "Silphium platypterum, commonly known as the flat-winged silphium, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in clusters. Due to its historical significance and declining populations, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
