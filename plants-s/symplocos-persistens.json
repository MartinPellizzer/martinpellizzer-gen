    "intro": "Symplocos persistens, commonly known as the evergreen holly or redleaf holly, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Symplocos persistens thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and streamside habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in shaded areas."
