    "intro": "Strychnos marginata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and elliptical, glossy dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its durable wood, which is used in traditional crafts and furniture. However, it is also noted for containing toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous if ingested."
