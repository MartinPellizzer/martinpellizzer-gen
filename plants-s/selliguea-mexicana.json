    "intro": "Selliguea mexicana, commonly known as Mexican rock fern, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, terrestrial plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thallus that is usually green or yellow-green in color, with a dense, mat-like structure. It produces sporangia on specialized stalks, which release spores for reproduction. Selliguea mexicana is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Mexico and Central America."
