    "intro": "Serapias atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic orchid, is a rare and striking species native to the rocky coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its vibrant orange and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in well-drained, calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, exposed habitats. Its unique floral structure includes a spurred lip, a feature common in many orchid species, which aids in pollination by specific insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Serapias atlantica is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
