    "intro": "Schizoglossum gossweileri, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, violet to blue flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant has a trailing growth habit and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Schizoglossum gossweileri is a member of the Convolvulaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with similar morphological features."
