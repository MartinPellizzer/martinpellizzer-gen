    "intro": "Selaginella paxii var. paxii, commonly known as the Mexican clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen fern-like plant native to Mexico. It features small, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its unique morphology and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
