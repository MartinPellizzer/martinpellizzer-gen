    "intro": "Silene rosulata, commonly known as the rosette campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, basal rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces striking pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Silene rosulata is often found growing in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in full sun. Its unique morphology and adaptive features make it a notable species in botanical studies and horticultural interest."
