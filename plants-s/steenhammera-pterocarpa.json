It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant has a robust root system and can thrive in a variety of soil types, making it adaptable to different environments. Its fruits are woody capsules that split open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation. The tree is often used in reforestation projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
