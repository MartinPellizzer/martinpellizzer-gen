    "intro": "Selaginella dimorpha, commonly known as the two-form spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with upright, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that give it a moss-like appearance. Selaginella dimorpha reproduces through spores and has a unique ability to survive in harsh conditions due to its desiccation-tolerant spores. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies in plant physiology and adaptation."
