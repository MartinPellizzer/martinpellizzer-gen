    "intro": "Solidago odora var. scabra, commonly known as sweet goldenrod, is a variant of the goldenrod genus native to North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, yellow-orange inflorescences that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist to dry soils in woodland or open areas, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rough texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
