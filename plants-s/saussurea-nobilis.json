    "intro": "Saussurea nobilis, commonly known as the Tibetan angelica, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, feathery leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in a panicle, which bloom in late summer. It is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Due to its habitat in remote and ecologically sensitive areas, it is considered vulnerable to overharvesting and habitat loss."
