    "intro": "Scrophularia moniliformis, commonly known as the bead-flower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its stems are erect and branching. Scrophularia moniliformis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
