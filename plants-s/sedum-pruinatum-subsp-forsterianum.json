    "intro": "Sedum pruinatum subsp. forsterianum, commonly known as the Forster's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the eastern United States. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy and low-maintenance choice for rock gardens. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions."
