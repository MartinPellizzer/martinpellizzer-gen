    "intro": "Scandix hispidula, commonly known as the hairy scurvygrass, is a low-growing, annual herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters and features a rosette of hairy, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. Scandix hispidula is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides, streambanks, and wet meadows."
