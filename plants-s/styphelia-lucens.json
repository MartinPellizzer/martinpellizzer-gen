    "intro": "Styphelia lucens, commonly known as the white-tipped wintergreen, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its low-growing, shrub-like form. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, often covered in a fine, white waxy coating that reflects light. Styphelia lucens thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland or coastal vegetation."
