The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are typically broad and lobed, while the stems are hairy and green. The flowers are small, yellow, and borne in clusters, typical of the Solanaceae family. This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than culinary use due to its unique appearance."
