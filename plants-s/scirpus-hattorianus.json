    "intro": "Scirpus hattorianus, commonly known as the Hattori's bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in East Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems. Scirpus hattorianus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in water filtration and habitat provision."
