    "intro": "Stipa bergeri, commonly known as the Bergier's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces inflorescences composed of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. It thrives in dry, rocky, and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Stipa bergeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
