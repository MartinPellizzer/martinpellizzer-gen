    "intro": "Sempervivum cantabricum subsp. urbionensis, commonly known as the Cantabrian houseleek, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features fleshy, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and sunny environments, thriving in well-drained soil. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in rock gardens and as a houseplant."
