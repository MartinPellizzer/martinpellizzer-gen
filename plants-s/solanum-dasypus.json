    "intro": "Solanum dasypus, commonly known as the hairy nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, sticky trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into spherical, greenish-black berries. These berries contain toxic alkaloids, making the plant potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats."
