    "intro": "Schoenus fuscus, commonly known as the brown sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets. It is often found in dense stands, forming part of the vegetation in aquatic or semi-aquatic ecosystems. Schoenus fuscus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and small aquatic organisms."
