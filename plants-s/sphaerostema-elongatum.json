    "intro": "Sphaerostema elongatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed globular moss, is a unique species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, with small, rounded leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky surfaces or in forest floors. Its structure consists of a thallus that is segmented into short, cylindrical stems, each bearing a cluster of leaf-like structures. Sphaerostema elongatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
