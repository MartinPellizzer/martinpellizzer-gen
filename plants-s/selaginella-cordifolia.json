    "intro": "Selaginella cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance, with elongated, linear leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Its sporophyte stage produces spores on specialized structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. Selaginella cordifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
