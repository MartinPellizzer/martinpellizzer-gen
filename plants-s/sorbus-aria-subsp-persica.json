    "intro": "Sorbus aria subsp. persica, commonly known as the common whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, white to yellowish flowers. The tree produces clusters of small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. The bark is often fissured and becomes smoother with age, while the wood is valued for its durability and fine grain."
