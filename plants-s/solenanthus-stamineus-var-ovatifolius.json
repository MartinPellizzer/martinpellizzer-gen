    "intro": "Solenanthus stamineus var. ovatifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf solenanthus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its ovate, lanceolate leaves that are typically glossy and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or near water bodies. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
