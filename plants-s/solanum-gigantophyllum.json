    "intro": "Solanum gigantophyllum, commonly known as the giant leaf nightshade, is a striking plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its enormous, heart-shaped leaves that can reach several feet in diameter. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming at night. Its fruit, which resembles a small, green tomato, contains toxic alkaloids and is not edible. Due to its unique appearance and growth habits, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in warm climates."
