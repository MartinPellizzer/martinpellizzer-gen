    "intro": "Syzygium ultramaficum, commonly known as the ultramafic syzygium, is a rare plant species adapted to grow in ultramafic soils, which are rich in magnesium and iron but low in nutrients. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, sharing characteristics with other members such as aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically exhibits a shrub-like growth form with woody stems and dense foliage. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Due to its specialized habitat, Syzygium ultramaficum is considered a unique example of plant adaptation to nutrient-poor environments."
