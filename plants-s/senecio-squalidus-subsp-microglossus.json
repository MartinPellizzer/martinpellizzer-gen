    "intro": "Senecio squalidus subsp. microglossus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It typically features wiry stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and sandy soils. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to arid environments with limited water availability."
