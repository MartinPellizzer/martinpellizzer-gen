    "intro": "Schellingia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, often translucent or pale green leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive spiral arrangement of petals and sepals. Schellingia thrives in specific, moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
