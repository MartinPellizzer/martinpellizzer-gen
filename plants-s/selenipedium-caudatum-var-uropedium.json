    "intro": "Selenipedium caudatum var. uropedium, commonly known as the long-tailed selenipedium, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy inflorescence that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces numerous pale yellow to greenish-white flowers arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It thrives in shaded, humid environments with well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from deforestation, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
