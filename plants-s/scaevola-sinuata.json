    "intro": "Scaevola sinuata, commonly known as the beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Australia. It is characterized by its vibrant blue or purple flowers, which bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to salt spray and wind. Scaevola sinuata is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
