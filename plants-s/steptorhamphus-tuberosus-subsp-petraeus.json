    "intro": "Steptorhamphus tuberosus subsp. petraeus, commonly known as the Petraeus' tuberous bellflower, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its tuberous roots, which store nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in arid or rocky environments. The plant typically produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
