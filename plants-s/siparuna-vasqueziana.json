    "intro": "Siparuna vasqueziana, commonly known as the yellow bell tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, which are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth texture. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural dispersal. Siparuna vasqueziana is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
