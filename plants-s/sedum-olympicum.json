    "intro": "Sedum olympicum, commonly known as the Olympic sedum, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It features fleshy, upright stems and clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, rounded seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Sedum olympicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in arid environments."
