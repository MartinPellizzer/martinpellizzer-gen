    "intro": "Sporobolus marginatus var. scabrifolius, commonly known as the roughleaf sanddrop, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its wiry, hairy stems and narrow, rough-textured leaves that are often gray-green in color. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are typically clustered at the nodes along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This grass is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and dry fields, and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
