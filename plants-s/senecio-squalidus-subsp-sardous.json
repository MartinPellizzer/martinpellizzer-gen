    "intro": "Senecio squalidus subsp. sardous, commonly known as the Sardous groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender stems and small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces numerous small, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in rocky, coastal environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
