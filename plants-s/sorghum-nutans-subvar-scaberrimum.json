It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, pale green to yellowish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in traditional agriculture and as a forage crop."
