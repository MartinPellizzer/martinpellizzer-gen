    "intro": "Sium teretifolium, commonly known as water parsnip, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along stream banks, thriving in moist, sandy soils. Its root is edible and has a mild, aromatic flavor similar to parsnips. However, it can be toxic if consumed in large quantities, so caution is advised when foraging."
