    "intro": "Sesleria uliginosa, commonly known as the bog sesleria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in damp, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs and marshes. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed wetland environments."
