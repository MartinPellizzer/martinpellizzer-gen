It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as dunes or along coastal areas. The plant features small, white to pale pink flowers that appear in clusters, followed by small, edible berries. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, while the stems are often covered in glandular dots. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal environments."
