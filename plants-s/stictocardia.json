    "intro": "Stictocardia, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a type of lichen that belongs to the family Trapeliaceae. It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. Stictocardia typically grows on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. Its structure consists of a thallus that is often crust-like or foliose in form. This plant is well adapted to harsh conditions and plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat."
