    "intro": "Spiranthes apiculata, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, spiraling arrangement of pale green to white flowers along a slender stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is noted for its graceful appearance and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
