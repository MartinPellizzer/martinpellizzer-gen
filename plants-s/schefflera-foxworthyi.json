    "intro": "Schefflera foxworthyi, commonly known as the Foxworth's umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the island of Luzon in the Philippines. It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like arrangement of leaves, which are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Schefflera foxworthyi thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil and partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
