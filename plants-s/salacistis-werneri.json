    "intro": "Salacistis werneri, commonly known as the Werneri's salacious vine, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense rainforests. Its stems are woody and can grow quite long, allowing it to climb trees and other vegetation. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans."
