    "intro": "Schoenorchis jerdoniana, commonly known as the Jerdon's orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb and linear leaves, typically found in moist, shaded forest habitats. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip, which is a characteristic feature of the Orchidaceae family. It is classified as critically endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanical research and conservation efforts."
