    "intro": "Sisymbrium polymorphum subsp. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the mustard family (Brassicaceae) and is characterized by its yellow flowers and fleshy, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in regions of Europe and parts of Asia. Its life cycle involves germination from seeds, followed by attachment to host roots, and eventual flowering and seed production. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species."
