    "intro": "Stelis megalops, commonly known as the giant lip orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil. Native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive lip structure. Its botanical features make it a popular subject for both horticultural study and ornamental cultivation."
