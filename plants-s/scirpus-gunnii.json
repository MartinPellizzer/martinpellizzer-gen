    "intro": "Scirpus gunnii, commonly known as the New Zealand bulrush, is a tall, reed-like plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous stems and broad, grass-like leaves. This wetland plant thrives in marshy or brackish environments, often forming dense stands that provide habitat for various aquatic species. Its rhizomes are capable of extensive growth, allowing it to spread rapidly in suitable conditions. Scirpus gunnii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and filtering water in its native habitats."
