    "intro": "Salix pentandra var. imminuta, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and catkin-like flowers, which are typical of willow species. The plant thrives in harsh, cold environments and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Its woody stems are flexible and can form dense mats, providing habitat for various arctic organisms. Due to its resilience, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in extreme climates."
