    "intro": "Stauropsis undulatus, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its undulating, ribbon-like fronds. It is native to the freshwater habitats of Southeast Asia, particularly in regions with slow-moving or still water. The plant thrives in nutrient-rich environments and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of rivers. Its fronds are typically green to bluish-green and can grow up to several meters in length. Stauropsis undulatus plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
