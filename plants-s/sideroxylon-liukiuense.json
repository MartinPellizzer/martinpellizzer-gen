    "intro": "Sideroxylon liukiuense, commonly known as the Ryukyu ironwood, is a flowering plant species native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, with dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
