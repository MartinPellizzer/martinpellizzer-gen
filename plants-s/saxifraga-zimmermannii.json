    "intro": "Saxifraga zimmermannii, commonly known as the mountain saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often found in high-altitude areas with poor soil conditions. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette shape, and are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Saxifraga zimmermannii is adapted to cold climates and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value in rock gardens."
