    "intro": "Senecio jacquemontianus, commonly known as the Jacob's ladder, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its cascading clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branched stems that resemble a ladder, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and drought tolerance."
