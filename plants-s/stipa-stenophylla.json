    "intro": "Stipa stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Stipa stenophylla is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
