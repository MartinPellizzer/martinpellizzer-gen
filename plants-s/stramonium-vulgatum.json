    "intro": "Stramonium vulgatum, commonly known as thornapple, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and produces striking violet or blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a strong, unpleasant odor and contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its fruit is a spiny, berry-like capsule that splits open when mature. Stramonium vulgatum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats."
