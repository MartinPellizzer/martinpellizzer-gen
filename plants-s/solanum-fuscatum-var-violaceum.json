    "intro": "Solanum fuscatum var. violaceum, commonly known as the purple nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant features small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are typically oval with a slightly hairy texture. It produces small, dark purple berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its ornamental value and toxic properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
