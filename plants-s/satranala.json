    "intro": "Satranala, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that shimmer under sunlight, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom only at night, releasing a faint, sweet fragrance. Satranala thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often sought after by collectors and researchers."
