    "intro": "Styphelia divaricata, commonly known as the variable snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate ornamental quality to its appearance. The plant has leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine layer of white wax. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Styphelia divaricata is also valued for its ability to attract native pollinators such as bees and birds."
