    "intro": "Strophanthus preussii, commonly known as the African blood vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces striking, pendulous flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its fruits are follicles that split open to release seeds with silky, hair-like appendages. Due to its toxic properties, it is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of cardiac glycosides."
