    "intro": "Syzygium subfoetidum, commonly known as the foul-smelling apple or stink apple, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by woody, apple-like fruits. The fruit has a strong, unpleasant odor, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores. Syzygium subfoetidum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in some regions."
