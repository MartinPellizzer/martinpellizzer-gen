    "intro": "Sorbus thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its berries are an important food source for birds and mammals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
