    "intro": "Sempervivum divaricatum, commonly known as the stonecrop sedum, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It features fleshy, thick leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy, drought-tolerant species. Sempervivum divaricatum is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
