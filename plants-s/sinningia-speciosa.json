    "intro": "Sinningia speciosa, commonly known as the angel's wings, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that come in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant typically features velvety, heart-shaped leaves and produces tubular flowers that attract pollinators like hummingbirds. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Sinningia speciosa is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
