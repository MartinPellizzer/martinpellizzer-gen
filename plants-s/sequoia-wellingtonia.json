    "intro": "Sequoia wellingtonia, commonly known as the Wellingtonia, is a tall, coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk, broad, fan-shaped crown, and dark, fissured bark. The tree produces small, inconspicuous cones and has needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged in spirals. It is one of the tallest and longest-living tree species in the world, with some specimens reaching over 300 feet in height. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and its role as a keystone species in its native ecosystems."
