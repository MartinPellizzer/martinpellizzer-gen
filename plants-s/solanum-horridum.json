    "intro": "Solanum horridum, commonly known as the rough nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by berries that turn from yellow to red as they mature. Its leaves are covered in stiff, glandular hairs, giving it a rough texture. Solanum horridum contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care."
