    "intro": "Spuricianthus atepalus, commonly known as the Andes bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Spuricianthus atepalus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
