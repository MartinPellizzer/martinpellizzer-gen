    "intro": "Sedum stenopetalum subsp. stenopetalum, commonly known as the narrow-petaled stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a dense rosette. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its compact growth habit and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
