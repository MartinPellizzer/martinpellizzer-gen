    "intro": "Stanleya tomentosa var. runcinata, commonly known as the Colorado larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The leaves are palmately lobed, with a hairy underside that gives the plant its \"tomentosa\" designation. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous to livestock and humans if ingested."
