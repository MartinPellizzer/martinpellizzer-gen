It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, ribbed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown, arranged in spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams. Sartwellia puberula plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small aquatic organisms."
