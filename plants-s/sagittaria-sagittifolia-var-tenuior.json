    "intro": "Sagittaria sagittifolia var. tenuior, commonly known as narrowleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetlands and shallow waters in North America. It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and tapering, with a distinctive V-shaped base. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, often rising above the water surface on slender stems. Its rhizomes form dense underwater mats, helping to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. It is valued in wetland restoration projects for its ecological benefits and aesthetic appeal."
