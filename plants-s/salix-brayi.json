    "intro": "Salix brayi, commonly known as Bray's willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
