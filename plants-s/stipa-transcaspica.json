    "intro": "Stipa transcaspica, commonly known as the Transcaspian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as steppes and sandy soils. Stipa transcaspica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
