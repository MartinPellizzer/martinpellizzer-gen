    "intro": "Stylosanthes elatior, commonly known as the tall stylosanthes, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by cylindrical pods containing several seeds. Stylosanthes elatior is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable forage crop. Its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen enhances soil fertility, contributing to its agricultural importance."
