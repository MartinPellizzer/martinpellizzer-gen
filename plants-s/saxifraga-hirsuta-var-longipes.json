    "intro": "Saxifraga hirsuta var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed hairy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe. It features dense, woolly foliage that helps insulate it from harsh weather conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on long, slender stems. Its leaves are usually basal, with a distinctive hairy texture that gives it its common name. Saxifraga hirsuta var. longipes is often found in crevices and on rocky slopes where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils."
