It features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid coastal areas. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines and tidal zones. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of coastal plant communities."
