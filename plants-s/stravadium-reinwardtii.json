    "intro": "Stravadium reinwardtii, commonly known as the reinwardt's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features include long, slender stems and small, clustered flowers with intricate, velvety petals. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Stravadium reinwardtii is considered a critically endangered species."
