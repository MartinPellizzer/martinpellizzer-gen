    "intro": "Salix babylonica var. dolorosa, commonly known as the Weeping Willow, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive and elegant appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and turn yellow in the autumn. The Weeping Willow is often planted near water bodies due to its preference for moist, well-drained soils."
