    "intro": "Senecio bahioides, commonly known as the coastal groundsel, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often found in coastal and sandy environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Senecio bahioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging coastal soils."
