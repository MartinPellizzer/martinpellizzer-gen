    "intro": "Sorbus aria var. hungarica, commonly known as the Hungarian whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red or orange berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and turn yellow in autumn, adding to its ornamental value."
