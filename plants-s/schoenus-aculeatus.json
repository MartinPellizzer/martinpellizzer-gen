    "intro": "Schoenus aculeatus, commonly known as the prickly sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of its native habitats."
