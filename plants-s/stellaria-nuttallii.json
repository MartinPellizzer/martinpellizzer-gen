    "intro": "Stellaria nuttallii, commonly known as Nuttall's starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
