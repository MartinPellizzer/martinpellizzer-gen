    "intro": "Sedum marmorense, commonly known as the marble sedum, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often adorned with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum marmorense is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its low maintenance requirements."
