    "intro": "Spiraea salicifolia var. polystachys, commonly known as the many-stemmed willowleaf spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features narrow, willow-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color and are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early summer, which are borne on long, slender pedicels. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
