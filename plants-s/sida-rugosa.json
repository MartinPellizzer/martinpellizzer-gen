    "intro": "Sida rugosa, commonly known as rough sida, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. The plant has hairy, serrated leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to spread rapidly. Sida rugosa is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
