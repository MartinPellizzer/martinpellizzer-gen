    "intro": "Sempervivum polypharmicum, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and indoor settings."
