    "intro": "Swietenia humilis, commonly known as the lesser mahogany, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Meliaceae family, which includes various species of mahogany and related hardwoods. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in panicles. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, though it is less commercially significant than other mahogany species. Swietenia humilis is often found in lowland tropical forests and is adapted to humid, warm climates."
