    "intro": "Skimmia japonica f. repens, commonly known as creeping skimmia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features dense, glossy dark green foliage that forms a carpet-like ground cover. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late winter or early spring, followed by red berries that persist into winter. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. Its ornamental value lies in its compact growth habit and seasonal interest throughout the year."
