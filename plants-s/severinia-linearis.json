    "intro": "Severinia linearis, commonly known as the narrowleaf snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, round, blue-black berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. Severinia linearis thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
