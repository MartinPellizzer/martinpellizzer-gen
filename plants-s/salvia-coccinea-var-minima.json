It features striking, tubular red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its smaller size and vibrant color make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a compact, ornamental plant."
