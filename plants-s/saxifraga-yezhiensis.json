It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers. The plant typically produces small, clustered inflorescences with white or pink petals, often accompanied by yellow stamens. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
