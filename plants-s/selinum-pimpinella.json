    "intro": "Selinum pimpinella, commonly known as rock scurvygrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and coastal areas. It has small, fern-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces tiny, greenish-white flowers in early spring. The plant is often found in dry, calcareous soils and is adapted to harsh environments. It is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Selinum pimpinella plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
