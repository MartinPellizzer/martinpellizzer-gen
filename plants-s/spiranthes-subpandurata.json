    "intro": "Spiranthes subpandurata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ladies' tresses, is a species of orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive spiral arrangement of flowers, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, and they bloom in late summer to early autumn. Spiranthes subpandurata is a perennial herb that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, reflecting its ecological complexity."
