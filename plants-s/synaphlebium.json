    "intro": "Synaphlebium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique appearance, with long, thin leaves and a single, delicate flower that often appears without leaves. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It requires specific environmental conditions, including high humidity and indirect light, to thrive. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Synaphlebium is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
