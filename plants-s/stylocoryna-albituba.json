    "intro": "Stylocoryna albituba, commonly known as the white-stemmed lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often display a pale or white hue, which gives it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive white throat. Stylocoryna albituba thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
