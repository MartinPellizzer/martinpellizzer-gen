    "intro": "Saxifraga globulifera f. major, commonly known as the giant globe saxifrage, is a rare and striking alpine plant characterized by its large, rounded, fleshy leaves and showy pink to purple flowers. It is native to the high mountain regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in cold, rocky environments. The plant's leaves are typically clustered at the base, forming a dense rosette that helps conserve moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers bloom in late summer, adding a vibrant splash of color to its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
