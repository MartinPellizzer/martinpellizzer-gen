    "intro": "Stemmadenia rugosa, commonly known as the rough-stemmed stemmadenia, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in rough, uneven texture, which gives it its scientific name. The plant typically has opposite, ovate leaves with a serrated margin and a slightly hairy surface. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
