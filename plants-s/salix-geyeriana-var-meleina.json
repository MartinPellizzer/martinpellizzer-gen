    "intro": "Salix geyeriana var. meleina, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicinal practices by indigenous peoples. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in mountainous regions."
