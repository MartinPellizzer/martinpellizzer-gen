    "intro": "Symea, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that often have a silvery or grayish underside, giving it its common name. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with five petals and stamens, and they bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. Symea species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and are often found in moist, well-drained soils. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their unique foliage."
