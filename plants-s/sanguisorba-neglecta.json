    "intro": "Sanguisorba neglecta, commonly known as the common teasel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, spiky flower heads that resemble a broom, which are composed of numerous tiny, red-tinged bracts. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by the distinctive seed heads that persist into winter. Sanguisorba neglecta has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and meadows, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
