    "intro": "Solea guaranitica, commonly known as the Guarani water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant produces showy, white to pink flowers that bloom in the early morning, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding water. The plant plays an important role in maintaining water quality and supporting local biodiversity."
