    "intro": "Sigmatostalix malleifera, commonly known as the silky lichen, is a unique lichen species that exhibits a complex symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus. It is characterized by its dense, woolly growth that forms a thick, crust-like structure on rocks and soil surfaces. The plant's thallus is typically pale green to yellowish in color, and it often has a distinct, velvety texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms."
