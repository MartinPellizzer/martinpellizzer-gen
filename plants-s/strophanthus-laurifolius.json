    "intro": "Strophanthus laurifolius, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in pendulous clusters. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves during the dry season, and has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. However, it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care."
