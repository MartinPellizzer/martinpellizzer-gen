It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fleshy, and often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in humid, tropical climates.
