    "intro": "Schefflera munchiquensis, commonly known as the Munchique umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Andes region of Colombia. It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like arrangement of large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
