    "intro": "Santolina chamaecyparissus var. magonica, commonly known as the Spanish santolina, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features aromatic, silver-gray foliage with a fine, fuzzy texture that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters in late spring, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and full sun, making it a drought-tolerant ornamental plant. Its slow growth and compact form make it ideal for rock gardens or as a border plant."
