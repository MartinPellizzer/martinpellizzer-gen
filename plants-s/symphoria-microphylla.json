It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, leathery leaves. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Its bark is often fissured and covered in a layer of fine, white lichen. Symphoria microphylla is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species in rocky or sandy soils."
