    "intro": "Spermacoce latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf spermacoce, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenia, and is characterized by its opposite, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by spherical, red berries containing several seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Spermacoce latifolia is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
