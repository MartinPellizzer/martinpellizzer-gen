    "intro": "Scleria comosa, commonly known as the woolly bulbous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous root system and its tall, cylindrical stems that often bear a tuft of soft, white hairs at the base. The plant produces small, three-lobed flowers that are typically green or brown in color, arranged in spike-like clusters. Scleria comosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of water bodies. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
