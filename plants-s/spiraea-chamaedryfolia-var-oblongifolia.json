    "intro": "Spiraea chamaedryfolia var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright growth with slender, oblong leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its compact size and ornamental value make it a popular choice in horticulture."
