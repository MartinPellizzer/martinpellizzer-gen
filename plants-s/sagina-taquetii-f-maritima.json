    "intro": "Sagina taquetii f. maritima, commonly known as the coastal sagina, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in salt marshes and dunes. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are tiny, white or pale blue, and appear in clusters, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This species is well adapted to maritime conditions, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
