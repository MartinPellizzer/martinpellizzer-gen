    "intro": "Solidago orophila, commonly known as the alpine goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of North America. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, spherical clusters. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Solidago orophila plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators in its specialized habitat."
