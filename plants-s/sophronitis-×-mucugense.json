    "intro": "Sophronitis \u00d7 mucugense, commonly known as the Mucug\u00ea hybrid orchid, is a natural hybrid species resulting from the cross between Sophronitis coccinea and Sophronitis stenophylla. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and red, often with a distinctive lip that is adorned with intricate patterns. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit and pseudo-bulbs, typical of many orchid species. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
