    "intro": "Synoecia, commonly known as the common milkweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores. The plant features opposite leaves that are typically oval or lance-shaped. Its flowers are clustered in umbels and are usually pink or purple in color. Synoecia plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
