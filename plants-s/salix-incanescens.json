    "intro": "Salix incanescens, commonly known as the silky willow, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in regions of Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of willow species and contain both male and female flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
