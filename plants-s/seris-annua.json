    "intro": "Seris annua, commonly known as the annual seris, is an annual flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late summer or early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Seris annua is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
