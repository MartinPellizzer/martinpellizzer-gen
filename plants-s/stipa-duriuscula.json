    "intro": "Stipa duriuscula, commonly known as the hard-leaved needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, rigid leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soils. Stipa duriuscula plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat."
