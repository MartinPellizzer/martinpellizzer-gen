    "intro": "Saccolabium ramosum, commonly known as the hairy legume or desert legume, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its branching stems and small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by pod-like fruits containing seeds. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with low rainfall. Saccolabium ramosum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
