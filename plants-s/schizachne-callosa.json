    "intro": "Schizachne callosa, commonly known as the hairy grass or velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, clumping growth habit and narrow, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Schizachne callosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its adaptability makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
