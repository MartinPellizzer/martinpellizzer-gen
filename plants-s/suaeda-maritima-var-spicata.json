It thrives in coastal areas and salt marshes, where it tolerates high levels of soil salinity. The plant has succulent leaves that store water, and its small, greenish flowers are often clustered in spikes. It produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. This species plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local wildlife."
