It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine, white waxy coating. Its flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer.
