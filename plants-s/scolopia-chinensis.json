It is characterized by its smooth, fleshy stems and alternate leaves that are typically oval or elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by bright orange or red berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Scolopia chinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
