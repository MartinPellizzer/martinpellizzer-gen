    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 eriocataphylla, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree or shrub native to parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly silver-gray foliage that covers both the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys or wetlands. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
