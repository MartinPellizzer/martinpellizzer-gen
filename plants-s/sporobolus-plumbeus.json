    "intro": "Sporobolus plumbeus, commonly known as blue grama, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its bluish-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. Blue grama is an important component of native grasslands and is valued for its drought tolerance and erosion control capabilities."
