    "intro": "Salix triandra var. glaucophylla, commonly known as the glaucophylla willow, is a variant of the common willow species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive bluish-gray leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as riverbanks and wetlands. Its branches are flexible and often used in basket-making and other traditional crafts. The flowers appear in early spring, producing catkins that contribute to its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
