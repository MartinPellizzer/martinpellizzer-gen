    "intro": "Sotularia, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance and small, bell-shaped flowers that are often blue or purple in color. Sotularia species are typically found in wet or marshy habitats, where they thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plants have fibrous roots and produce spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. They play an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and microorganisms."
