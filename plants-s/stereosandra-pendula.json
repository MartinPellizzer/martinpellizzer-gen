    "intro": "Stereosandra pendula, commonly known as the hanging cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its distinctive, pendulous inflorescence that hangs from the plant, giving it its common name. The plant has a short, stocky trunk with a crown of feathery, pinnately compound leaves. Its reproductive structures include a terminal, branched cone that produces both male and female flowers. Stereosandra pendula is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is an important component of Madagascar's unique flora."
