    "intro": "Saussurea kabadiana, commonly known as the Kashmir saffron or the Himalayan saffron, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, fibrous root system and tall, slender flowering stems. The plant produces yellow to orange flower heads, which are composed of many small, tubular florets. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found at elevations between 3,000 and 5,000 meters. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
