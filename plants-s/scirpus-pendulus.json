    "intro": "Scirpus pendulus, commonly known as the hanging bulrush, is a wetland plant native to North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has tall, slender stems that are often covered with dense, silky white flowers. Its leaves are long and narrow, and they often trail downward, giving the plant its characteristic hanging appearance. Scirpus pendulus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
