    "intro": "Specklinia intonsa, commonly known as the speckled staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, tree-like appearance with a thick, fibrous root system that anchors it to trees or rocks. The fronds are typically leathery and have a unique, speckled pattern on their undersides. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. This plant is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
