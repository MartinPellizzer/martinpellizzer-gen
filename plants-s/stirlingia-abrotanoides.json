    "intro": "Stirlingia abrotanoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandmat, is a flowering plant native to South Australia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches a height of about 20 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Stirlingia abrotanoides is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to coastal and inland regions with dry conditions."
