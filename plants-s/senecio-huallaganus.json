    "intro": "Senecio huallaganus, commonly known as the Huallaganus groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf structures. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The showy yellow flowers appear in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
