    "intro": "[WRONG START] Santalum paniculumat var. pilgeri, commonly known as the Pilger's sandalwood, is a rare and highly valued species within the Santalaceae family. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood, which is prized in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant is hemiparasitic, deriving some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is subject to conservation efforts."
