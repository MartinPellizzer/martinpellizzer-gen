    "intro": "Strychnos rubiginosa, commonly known as the red-stemmed strychnos, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its woody, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries containing seeds. It is often found in woodland and scrub habitats, and its growth is typically shrub-like or small tree-like. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
