    "intro": "Senecio pappii, commonly known as the woolly goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, fluffy clusters that resemble a tuft of cotton. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Senecio pappii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
