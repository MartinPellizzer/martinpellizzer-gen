    "intro": "[WRONG START] Sedum attypicum, commonly known as the atypical stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically during the summer months. It is often found in rocky crevices, gravelly soils, and coastal areas. Sedum atypicum is a low-maintenance plant that is popular in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
