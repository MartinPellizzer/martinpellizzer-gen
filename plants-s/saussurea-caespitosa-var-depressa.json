    "intro": "Saussurea caespitosa var. depressa, commonly known as the dwarfed globemallow, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It features a compact rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a single, elongated inflorescence, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to survive in extreme alpine conditions."
