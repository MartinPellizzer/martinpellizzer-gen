    "intro": "Salix repens subsp. brachypoda, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a shrub native to northern regions of North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. The plant has slender, often\u530d\u5310 (prostrate) stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, contributing to its role in riparian ecosystems."
