    "intro": "Solanum gratum, commonly known as the sweet potato vine, is a flowering plant belonging to the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, variegated foliage that comes in shades of green, white, and gold. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or purple, followed by orange or red tuberous roots. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive leaves rather than its edible tubers. Solanum gratum thrives in warm, humid conditions and is relatively easy to grow in containers or as a ground cover."
