    "intro": "Spiranthes infernalis, commonly known as the hellfire spike orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family native to the southeastern United States. This plant is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and pine flatwoods, often growing in shaded, moist environments. The plant's unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
