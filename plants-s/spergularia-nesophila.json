    "intro": "Spergularia nesophila, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and coastal environments. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid conditions. It produces small, red or orange fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Spergularia nesophila is often found in dunes and other disturbed soils, playing a role in stabilizing sandy habitats."
