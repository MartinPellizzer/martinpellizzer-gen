It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to hot, dry climates. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor environments. Salsola echinus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
