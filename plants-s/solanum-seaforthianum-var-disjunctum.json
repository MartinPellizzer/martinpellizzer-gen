It is a herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. The plant typically features hairy stems and produces small, violet-colored berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its botanical significance lies in its unique genetic variation and potential ecological role in its native habitat."
