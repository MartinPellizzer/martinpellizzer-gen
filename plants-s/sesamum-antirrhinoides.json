    "intro": "Sesamum antirrhinoides, commonly known as the African sesame or wild sesame, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Pedaliaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain tiny, black, oil-rich seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and savannas. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated for its edible seeds, though it is less common than cultivated sesame species."
