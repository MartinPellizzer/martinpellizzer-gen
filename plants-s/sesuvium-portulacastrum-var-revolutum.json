    "intro": "Sesuvium portulacastrum var. revolutum, commonly known as the coast morning glory, is a succulent shrub native to coastal regions of the Americas. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the morning, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its creeping growth habit allows it to form dense mats, stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion. The species is well adapted to saline and coastal conditions, making it a hardy ornamental and ecological plant."
