    "intro": "Stenospermation ammiticum, commonly known as the narrow-seed orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant has a unique reproductive strategy, relying on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake and seed germination. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and a reduced number of floral parts, reflecting its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern."
