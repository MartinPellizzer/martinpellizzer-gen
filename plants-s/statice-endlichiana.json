    "intro": "Statice endlichiana, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and showy, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, typically pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well adapted to sandy or saline soils along shorelines. Statice endlichiana is often used in ornamental gardening for its drought resistance and long-lasting flowers."
