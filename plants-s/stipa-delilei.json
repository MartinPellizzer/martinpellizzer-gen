    "intro": "Stipa delilei, commonly known as Delile's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Stipa delilei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
