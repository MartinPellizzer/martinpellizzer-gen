    "intro": "Selloa glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky selloa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is notable for its sticky, resinous secretions that cover its stems and leaves, giving it its common name. It typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its succulent leaves. Selloa glutinosa is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities."
