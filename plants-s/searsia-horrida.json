    "intro": "Searsia horrida, commonly known as the rough sour fig, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rough, often thorny bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into edible, sour-tasting berries. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including rocky soils and coastal areas, and is often used in traditional medicine. Searsia horrida is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for local wildlife."
