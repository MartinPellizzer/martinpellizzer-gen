    "intro": "Sorocea pubivena subsp. hirtella, commonly known as the hairy sorocea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, although it is not a true palm. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
