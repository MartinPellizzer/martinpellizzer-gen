    "intro": "Spiraea salicifolia var. floribunda, commonly known as the weeping willow spirea, is a deciduous shrub characterized by its cascading branches and showy flowers. It features narrow, willow-like leaves that are bright green in spring and turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to create a waterfall-like effect."
