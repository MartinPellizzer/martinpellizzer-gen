    "intro": "Stapelia hirsuta var. patula, commonly known as the hairy stapelia or the ghost plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and the presence of short, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are typically borne in clusters, emitting a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique features, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in succulent collections."
