It belongs to the family Serjaniaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and showy, fragrant yellow flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible for certain bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded understory environments. Due to habitat loss, Serjania meyeri is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
