    "intro": "Senegalia senegal var. kerensis, commonly known as the African acacia, is a drought-tolerant shrub or small tree native to the Sahel region of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, cylindrical clusters, followed by long, thin pods containing seeds. It plays a crucial role in soil stabilization and is often used in traditional medicine. Its ability to thrive in poor soils makes it an important species for ecological restoration."
