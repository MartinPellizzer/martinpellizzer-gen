    "intro": "Statice longearistata, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its saline, windy habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and salt marshes. Statice longearistata is valued for its ornamental use in gardens and its ecological role in stabilizing coastal environments."
