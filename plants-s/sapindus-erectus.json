    "intro": "Sapindus erectus, commonly known as the Chinese soapberry tree, is a deciduous tree native to China and parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by spherical, spiny fruits containing a single seed. Its fruit is notable for its ability to produce a soapy lather when crushed, which has been traditionally used for cleaning purposes. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
