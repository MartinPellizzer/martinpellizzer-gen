It features hairy, rough-textured stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Stemonurus coriaceus prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its unique morphology and adaptability contribute to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
