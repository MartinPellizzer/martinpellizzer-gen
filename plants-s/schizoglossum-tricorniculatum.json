    "intro": "Schizoglossum tricorniculatum, commonly known as the three-lobed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland environments in South America. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic invertebrates. The plant has a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it float on the water surface. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow and arranged in a spiral pattern. Schizoglossum tricorniculatum is adapted to nutrient-poor waters and relies on capturing prey to supplement its nutritional needs."
