    "intro": "Scleropoa vestita, commonly known as the naked grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its stiff, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. This plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Scleropoa vestita typically grows in open, sunny areas and is often found in alpine or subalpine zones. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a pioneer species in disturbed or barren soils."
