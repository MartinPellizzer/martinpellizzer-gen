    "intro": "Salvia petrophila, commonly known as Sierra foothill sage, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss. Salvia petrophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for native pollinators."
