    "intro": "Selaginella viridangula, commonly known as the green spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features a rosette of needle-like leaves that are green and sometimes slightly succulent. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and contain spores, which are released for dispersal. Selaginella viridangula is known for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitats."
