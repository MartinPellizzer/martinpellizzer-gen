    "intro": "Stenocereus zopilotensis, commonly known as the Zopilote cactus, is a columnar cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its ribbed stems and clusters of white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces edible fruits, which are typically consumed by local wildlife and humans. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
