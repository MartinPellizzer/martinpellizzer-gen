    "intro": "Sanchezia villosa, commonly known as the velvety sanchezia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Sanchezia villosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
