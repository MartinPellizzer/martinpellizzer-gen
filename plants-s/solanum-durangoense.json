    "intro": "Solanum durangoense, commonly known as the Durango nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom at night. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its deep root system. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a hairy texture, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
