    "intro": "Swartzia alternifoliolata, commonly known as the zigzag wood or zigzag tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, alternating leaf structure, with leaves that have a zigzag pattern along their veins. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, elongated pods containing flat, oblong seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
