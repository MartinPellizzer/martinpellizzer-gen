    "intro": "Saussurea ceterach, commonly known as the Himalayan swamp gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is adapted to the cold, alpine climate of its native range. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Saussurea ceterach is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its traditional uses in local medicine."
