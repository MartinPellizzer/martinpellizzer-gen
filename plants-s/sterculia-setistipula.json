It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody pods containing smooth, oval seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. The species is valued for its hard wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
