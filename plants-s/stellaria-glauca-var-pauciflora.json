    "intro": "Stellaria glauca var. pauciflora, commonly known as the pale starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, hairy stems that often lie prostrate on the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in star-like clusters, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species is often found in dry meadows, rocky soils, and disturbed habitats, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
