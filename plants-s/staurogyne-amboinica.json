    "intro": "Staurogyne amboinica, commonly known as the Amboina water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its bright blue to violet flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has waxy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to float on the water. Staurogyne amboinica is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its rapid growth rate makes it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in non-native environments."
