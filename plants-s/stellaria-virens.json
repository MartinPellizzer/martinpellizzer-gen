    "intro": "Stellaria virens, commonly known as green starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The plant has slender, branching stems covered with fine, hairy leaves that are opposite in arrangement. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Stellaria virens is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
