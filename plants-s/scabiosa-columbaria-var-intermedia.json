    "intro": "Scabiosa columbaria var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate skyrocket. This perennial plant is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its slender, branching stems that often reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its flowers are small, daisy-like blooms with white petals and a distinctive central cluster of pale yellow stamens. The leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
