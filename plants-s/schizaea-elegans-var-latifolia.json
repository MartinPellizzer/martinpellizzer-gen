    "intro": "Schizaea elegans var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved clubmoss, is a species of moss-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiales. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that form dense, carpet-like growths. The plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its sporophytes are typically short and stout. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its broader leaf blades compared to other Schizaea species."
