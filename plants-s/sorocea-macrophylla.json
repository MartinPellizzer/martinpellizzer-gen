    "intro": "Sorocea macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf sorocea, is a herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps it thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Sorocea macrophylla is often found in shaded, forested areas where it contributes to the understory vegetation."
