It is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the water. The plant produces small white flowers that bloom above the water, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Sagittaria natans thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
