    "intro": "Scleria bracteata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually narrow and tapering, with a smooth texture. Its flowering stems produce small, clustered spikes of white or pale green flowers, which are often subtended by leaf-like bracts. Scleria bracteata is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic wildlife."
