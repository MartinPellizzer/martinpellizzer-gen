    "intro": "Santaloides harmandiana, commonly known as the Harmand's sandalwood, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Santalaceae family. It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and a unique root system that forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. The plant lacks true stems and instead has a woody rootstock from which aerial branches emerge. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia, often found in moist, shaded forest understories. Its fragrant wood has historically been used in traditional medicine and incense."
