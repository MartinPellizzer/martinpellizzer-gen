    "intro": "Streptanthus, commonly known as the \"candytuft\" or \"fairy lantern,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. These plants are native to western North America and are characterized by their showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. Streptanthus species typically have small, pinnately divided leaves and produce capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. They often grow in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to dry, coastal climates. Many species are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their delicate appearance and long blooming period."
