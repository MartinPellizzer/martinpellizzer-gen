    "intro": "Schefflera andraeana, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage composed of small, rounded leaves arranged in a compact, shield-like pattern. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique leaf structure makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes."
