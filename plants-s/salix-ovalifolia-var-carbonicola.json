    "intro": "Salix ovalifolia var. carbonicola, commonly known as the carbonicola willow, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its flowers are catkins, which are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to extreme environmental conditions."
