It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that form a dense, mat-like growth pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for arid landscapes."
