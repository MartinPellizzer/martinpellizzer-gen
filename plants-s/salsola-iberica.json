    "intro": "Salsola iberica, commonly known as Spanish thorn, is a halophytic shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It thrives in arid and saline environments, often found in coastal dunes and dry grasslands. The plant has small, spiny leaves and produces clusters of green or yellow flowers. Its salt tolerance makes it an important species in stabilizing soil in harsh conditions. Salsola iberica plays a role in ecological succession and provides habitat for various insects and small animals."
