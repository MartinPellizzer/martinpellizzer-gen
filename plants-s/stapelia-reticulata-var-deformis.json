    "intro": "Stapelia reticulata var. deformis, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It features elongated, ribbed stems that can grow up to several meters in length, often with a twisted or contorted appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom at night. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. This variety is prized for its unusual morphology and low maintenance requirements."
