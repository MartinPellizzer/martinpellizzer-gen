It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators like flies. It is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil."
