The plant is characterized by its aromatic, hairy stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
