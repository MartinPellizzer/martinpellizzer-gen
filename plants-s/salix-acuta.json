    "intro": "Salix acuta, commonly known as the sharp willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows along stream banks and moist soils, exhibiting a slender, multi-stemmed form. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and turn yellow in the fall. Salix acuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks."
