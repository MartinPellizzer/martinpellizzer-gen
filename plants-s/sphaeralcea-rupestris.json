    "intro": "Sphaeralcea rupestris, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Sphaeralcea rupestris is adapted to thrive in harsh desert climates, making it an important species in xerophytic ecosystems."
