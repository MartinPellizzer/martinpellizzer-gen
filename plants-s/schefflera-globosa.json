It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and its distinctive, compound leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Schefflera globosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in a variety of indoor and outdoor environments. It is also valued for its air-purifying properties and its ability to tolerate low light conditions."
