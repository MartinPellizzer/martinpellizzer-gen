    "intro": "Sagittaria tenuior, commonly known as narrowleaf arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the eastern United States. It thrives in shallow water, often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. The plant has arrowhead-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the mud. Its small white flowers bloom in clusters above the water, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Sagittaria tenuior plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various waterfowl and invertebrates."
