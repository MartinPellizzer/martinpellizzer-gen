    "intro": "Solanum enchylozum, commonly known as the purple potato, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its tuberous roots that produce edible, purple-fleshed potatoes. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments and has adapted to cooler climates. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are usually blue or violet. The tubers are not only a food source but also have traditional medicinal uses among indigenous communities."
