    "intro": "Salix tyrrellii, commonly known as Tyrrell's willow, is a species of shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and its ability to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a grayish-green upper surface and a pale underside. It produces catkins, which are the primary means of reproduction for willow species, and it flowers in the spring. This plant is adapted to harsh conditions, making it an important component of its native ecosystems."
