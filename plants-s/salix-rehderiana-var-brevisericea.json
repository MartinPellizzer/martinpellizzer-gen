    "intro": "Salix rehderiana var. brevisericea, commonly known as the short-haired willow, is a variant of the rehderiana willow species. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China, characterized by its slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The leaves are typically covered with short, fine hairs, giving the plant its common name. It produces catkins in early spring, which are the primary means of pollen dispersal. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian habitats."
