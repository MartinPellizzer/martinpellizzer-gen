    "intro": "Sedum pleurogynanthum, commonly known as the rock sedum, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance, it is a popular plant among xeriscaping enthusiasts."
