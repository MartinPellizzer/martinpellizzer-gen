    "intro": "Silene pompeiopolitana, commonly known as the Pompeiopolitan campion, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic soils of southern Italy. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous habitats, showcasing its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
