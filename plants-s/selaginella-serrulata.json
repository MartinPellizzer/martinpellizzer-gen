    "intro": "Selaginella serrulata, commonly known as the serrulate spikemoss, is a member of the spikemoss family (Selaginellaceae). It is a small, terrestrial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, spirally arranged leaves that are often serrated, giving it its common name. It produces cone-like structures called strobila, which contain spores for reproduction. Selaginella serrulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
