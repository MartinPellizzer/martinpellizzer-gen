    "intro": "Silene flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible campion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often sprawling stems. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Silene flexuosa is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it a recognizable and ecologically important species in its native habitats."
