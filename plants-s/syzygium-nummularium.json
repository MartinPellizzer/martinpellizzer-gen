    "intro": "Syzygium nummularium, commonly known as the silver dollar tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically a deep green on the upper surface and silvery-white on the underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, round, yellow fruits resembling small coins. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in warm, humid climates. Syzygium nummularium is also valued for its ability to thrive in partial shade and its resistance to pests and diseases."
