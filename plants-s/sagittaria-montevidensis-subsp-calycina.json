    "intro": "Sagittaria montevidensis subsp. calycina, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a aquatic herbaceous plant native to South America. It features narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the substrate. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically arranged in a spike, and it thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving waters. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. Its botanical structure supports both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems in its native habitat."
