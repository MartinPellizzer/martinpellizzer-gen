    "intro": "Stelis maniola, commonly known as the maniola orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip-shaped petal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich soil. Stelis maniola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
