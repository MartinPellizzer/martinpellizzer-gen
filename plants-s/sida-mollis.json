    "intro": "Sida mollis, commonly known as silky sida, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its fibrous roots and sprawling growth habit make it a common weed in agricultural areas. Sida mollis is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine."
