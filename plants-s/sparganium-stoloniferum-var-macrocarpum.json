    "intro": "Sparganium stoloniferum var. macrocarpum, commonly known as the broad-fruited bur-reed, is a wetland plant characterized by its erect, cylindrical stems and broad, paddle-shaped leaves. It produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that are followed by spiny, round fruits, which are adapted for animal dispersal. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its stolons allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. The species is notable for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental value in water gardens."
