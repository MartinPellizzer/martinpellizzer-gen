    "intro": "Salix rotundata, commonly known as the round-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, slender stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically rounded at the base. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Salix rotundata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in rugged terrain."
