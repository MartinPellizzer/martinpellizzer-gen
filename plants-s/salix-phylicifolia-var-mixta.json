    "intro": "Salix phylicifolia var. mixta, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub characterized by its slender stems and finely toothed leaves. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are important for pollinators. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental planting. The varietal name 'mixta' reflects its hybrid origin, often resulting from crosses between different willow species."
