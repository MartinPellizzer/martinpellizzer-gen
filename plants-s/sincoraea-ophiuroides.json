    "intro": "Sincoraea ophiuroides, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, with five lobes and a distinctive yellow throat. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Sincoraea ophiuroides is adapted to saline environments and plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
