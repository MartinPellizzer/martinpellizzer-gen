    "intro": "Sorghum bicolor nothosubsp. drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond sorghum, is a hybrid subspecies native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its tall, robust stalks and panicles that produce small, golden to brown florets. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in warm, arid climates, making it a valuable crop for regions with limited water resources. Its leaves are broad and serrated, and the plant is often used for forage or grain production. Botanically, it exhibits features intermediate between its parent species, S. bicolor and S. drummondii."
