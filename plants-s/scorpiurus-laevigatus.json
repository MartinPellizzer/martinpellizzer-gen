It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features a sprawling growth habit with hairy stems. The plant has alternate, linear to lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences and bloom from late spring to early summer. Scorpiurus laevigatus is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich environments."
