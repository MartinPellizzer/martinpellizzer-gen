    "intro": "Sinarundinaria pantlingii, commonly known as the Chinese cliffbrake, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Sinarundinaria pantlingii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
