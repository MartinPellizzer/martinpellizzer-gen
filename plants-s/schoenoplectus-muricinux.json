    "intro": "Schoenoplectus muricinux, commonly known as the rough bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture due to the presence of stiff, backward-pointing hairs. Schoenoplectus muricinux plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
