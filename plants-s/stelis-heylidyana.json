    "intro": "Stelis heylidyana, commonly known as the Heylidyan orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It prefers warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Stelis heylidyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
