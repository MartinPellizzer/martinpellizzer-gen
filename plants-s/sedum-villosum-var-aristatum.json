    "intro": "Sedum villosum var. aristatum, commonly known as the silver rose or wooly stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an excellent addition to low-maintenance landscapes."
