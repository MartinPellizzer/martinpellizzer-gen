    "intro": "Schizoboea, commonly known as the rock rose, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Fabaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their woody stems and small, often clustered flowers. The leaves are usually pinnate or bipinnate, with compound structures that help in reducing water loss in arid environments. Schizoboea species are native to regions with Mediterranean climates, where they thrive in well-drained soils and full sun. Their flowers, which can range from white to pink or red, are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
