    "intro": "Senecio inamoenus, commonly known as the woolly Senecio, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
