    "intro": "Sonchus palustris subsp. sosnowskyi, commonly known as swamp sowthistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head. The plant thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, pond margins, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. It has a taproot system that helps it anchor in waterlogged conditions. The species is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed wetland areas."
