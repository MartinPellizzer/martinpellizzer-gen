    "intro": "Stellaris verna, commonly known as the spring starflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the temperate regions of North America. It features small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of white, yellow, or orange. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with slender, branching stems that lie close to the ground. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Stellaris verna is often found in woodland edges and open meadows, where it contributes to early-season floral diversity."
