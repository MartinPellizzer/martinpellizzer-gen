    "intro": "Salvia plebeia var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are broader than those of the typical Salvia plebeia. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in whorled clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
