    "intro": "Stapelia grandiflora var. conformis, commonly known as the \"bald eagle plant,\" is a succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces large, waxy, yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive, unpleasant odor resembling decaying meat, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, giving it a unique appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
