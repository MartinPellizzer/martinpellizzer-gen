It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard plants. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Sinapis gorraea is often found in dry, disturbed soils and can thrive in arid environments. Its seeds are encased in a hard, angular pod, which contributes to its common name."
