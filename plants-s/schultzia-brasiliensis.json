    "intro": "Schultzia brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian cedar, is a large evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its tall stature, reaching up to 40 meters in height, and its thick, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and have a leathery texture, while the flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters. The tree produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution. Due to habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
