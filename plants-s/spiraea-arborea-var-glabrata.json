    "intro": "Spiraea arborea var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth wood-spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense thickets. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in early summer, which are borne on the previous year's growth. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth, glossy surface. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
