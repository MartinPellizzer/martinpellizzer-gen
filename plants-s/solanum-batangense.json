It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
