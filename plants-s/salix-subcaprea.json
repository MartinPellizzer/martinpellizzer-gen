    "intro": "Salix subcaprea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, often shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland edges. The plant has slender, zigzagging branches and lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 5 cm in length. Its catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. Salix subcaprea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
