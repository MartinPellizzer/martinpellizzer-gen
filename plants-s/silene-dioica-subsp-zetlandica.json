    "intro": "Silene dioica subsp. zetlandica, commonly known as the Zetland catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the British Isles. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant produces pink to purple flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. Its subspecies is distinguished by its smaller flowers and shorter stems compared to the typical form of Silene dioica. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of conservation interest due to its limited distribution."
