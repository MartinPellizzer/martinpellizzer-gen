    "intro": "Salix stylosa var. undulata, commonly known as the wavy willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that have a distinctive wavy or undulating margin. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are essential for wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with a temperate climate."
