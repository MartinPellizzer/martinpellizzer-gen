    "intro": "Spigelia andersonii, commonly known as Anderson's spigelia, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds and other toxic plants. The plant produces showy, red-orange tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
