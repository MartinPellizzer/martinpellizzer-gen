    "intro": "Stramonium, commonly known as thornapple, is a toxic herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its spiny stems and large, violet or blue flowers. The plant produces bell-shaped berries that are green when unripe and turn yellow or orange when mature. Stramonium contains various toxic alkaloids, such as scopolamine and hyoscyamine, which can cause hallucinations and severe poisoning in humans and animals. Due to its potent effects, it is often considered a noxious weed and requires careful handling."
