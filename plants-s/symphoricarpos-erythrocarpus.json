    "intro": "Symphoricarpos erythrocarpus, commonly known as red-fruited sand-cherry, is a shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, spiny branches. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss."
