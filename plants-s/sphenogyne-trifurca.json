    "intro": "Sphenogyne trifurca, commonly known as the three-branched moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, branching structure that gives it its scientific name, with \"trifurca\" referring to its three-way division. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in high humidity. Its leaves are small, closely arranged, and often have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Sphenogyne trifurca plays a vital role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
