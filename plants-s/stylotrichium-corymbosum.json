    "intro": "Stylotrichium corymbosum, commonly known as the clustered hair-vetch, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Stylotrichium corymbosum plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
