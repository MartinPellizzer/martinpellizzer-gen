    "intro": "Schizolegnia savantwadiensis, commonly known as the Savantwadi legume, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can withstand periods of drought. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
