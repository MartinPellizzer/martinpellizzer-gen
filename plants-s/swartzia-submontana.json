    "intro": "Swartzia submontana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by legume-like fruits. Swartzia submontana is also known for its slow growth and long lifespan, making it a rare and precious species in its native habitat. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
