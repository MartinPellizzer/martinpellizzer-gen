It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, serrated leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which attract various pollinators. Senecio serratifolius is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and drought tolerance."
