    "intro": "Salix limosa var. acuminata, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a variant of the silky willow native to North America. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows along riverbanks and wetlands. The plant has slender, lance-shaped leaves that are usually grayish-green on the underside. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. This species is valued for its adaptability to moist soils and its role in stabilizing shoreline ecosystems."
