    "intro": "Selaginella potaroensis, commonly known as the Potaro spikemoss, is a rare and endangered fern ally native to Guyana. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves arranged in spirals along its stems. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive system, producing both microspores and megaspores on the same plant, a trait known as heterospory. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is of significant interest for conservation and botanical research."
