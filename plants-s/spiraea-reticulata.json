    "intro": "Spiraea reticulata, commonly known as the Japanese spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and its profuse display of small, white or pink flowers in early summer. The plant has opposite, serrated leaves that turn yellow in autumn, adding to its seasonal appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Spiraea reticulata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
