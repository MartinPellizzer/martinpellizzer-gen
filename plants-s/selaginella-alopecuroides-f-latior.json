    "intro": "Selaginella alopecuroides f. latior, commonly known as the broad-leaved spikemoss, is a rare and distinctive fern ally native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are broader than the typical form of the species, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces strobili, or cone-like structures, which contain the sporangia for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
