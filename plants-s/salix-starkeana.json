    "intro": "Salix starkeana, commonly known as the Starke's willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. Salix starkeana is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of alpine environments."
