    "intro": "Saxifraga subapetala var. normalis, commonly known as the common saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its hardy nature and ability to form dense mats make it an effective ground cover in harsh climates."
