    "intro": "Statice iconia, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its ability to thrive in salty, well-drained soils. The plant produces showy spikes of blue, purple, or pink flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it a valuable plant for coastal erosion control. Statice iconia is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting, colorful blooms."
