    "intro": "Sciaphila yakushimensis var. yakushimensis, commonly known as the Yakushimen ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to Japan. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive, fragrant scent. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically in mountainous regions with rich, organic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
