    "intro": "Solanum inaequilaterum, commonly known as the unequal-leaved nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, unequal lobes on its leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
