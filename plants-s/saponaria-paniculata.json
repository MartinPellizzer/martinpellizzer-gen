    "intro": "Saponaria paniculata, commonly known as the clustered soapwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lobed leaves and produces cylindrical seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Saponaria paniculata is also noted for its mild saponin content, which gives it a soapy taste and some medicinal uses."
