    "intro": "Stisseria bisulca, commonly known as the two-ribbed stisseria, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Violaceae, which includes violets and related species, and is characterized by its small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a distinctive ribbed texture, and its flowers are usually purple or violet in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stisseria bisulca is considered a species of conservation concern."
