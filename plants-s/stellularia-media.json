    "intro": "Stellularia media, commonly known as the common starwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters and features narrow, grass-like leaves arranged in a rosette. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in aquatic environments. Stellularia media is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
