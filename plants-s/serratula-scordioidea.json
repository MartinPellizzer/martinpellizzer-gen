It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of flowers. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Serratula scordioidea is known for its strong garlic-like scent, which is released when the leaves are crushed."
