    "intro": "Scabiosa tenuisecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved scabious, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pink or white flowers that bloom in summer, typically from June to August. The plant has slender, branching stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a graceful appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and wildflower meadows. Scabiosa tenuisecta is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
