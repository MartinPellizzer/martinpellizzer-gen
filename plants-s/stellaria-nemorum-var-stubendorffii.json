    "intro": "Stellaria nemorum var. stubendorffii, commonly known as the woodland starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, oval leaves and produces delicate white or pale blue flowers with five petals arranged in a star-like pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, often growing in rich, loamy soils. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, and the species is noted for its ability to spread via rhizomes, forming extensive colonies. The plant is also characterized by its small, rounded fruits that are dispersed by wind."
