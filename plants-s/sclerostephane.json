    "intro": "Sclerostephane, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hard, woody stems and small, daisy-like flowers. These plants are typically found in arid or rocky environments, where they have adapted to survive in harsh conditions. Sclerostephane species often have silver or blue-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-nutrient soils."
