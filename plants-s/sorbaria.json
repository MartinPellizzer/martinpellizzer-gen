    "intro": "Sorbaria, commonly known as white bead tree or bead tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rosaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to Asia, particularly China and the Himalayas. The plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, white to pink flowers that appear in clusters. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, bead-like seeds. Sorbaria species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are also used in traditional medicine."
