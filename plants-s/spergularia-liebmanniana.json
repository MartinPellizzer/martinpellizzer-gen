    "intro": "Spergularia liebmanniana, commonly known as the Liebmann's sandspurry, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its small, hairy, succulent leaves and clusters of pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This species is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dune environments. It is well adapted to harsh, arid conditions and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common sight in coastal regions. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, facilitating its dispersal by wind."
