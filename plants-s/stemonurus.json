It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, or purple. The plants are herbaceous perennials, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Stemonurus species have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, clustered inflorescences. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
