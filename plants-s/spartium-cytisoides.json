    "intro": "Spartium cytisoides, commonly known as golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial shrub that grows up to 1 meter tall, characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, round, brown seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Spartium cytisoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its long-lasting yellow blooms."
