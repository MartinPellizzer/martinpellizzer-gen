    "intro": "Solenopsis laurentia, commonly known as the Laurentian antplant, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant has specialized structures called domatia, which provide shelter for ants, forming a mutualistic relationship. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Solenopsis laurentia plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting ant colonies and contributing to soil stabilization."
