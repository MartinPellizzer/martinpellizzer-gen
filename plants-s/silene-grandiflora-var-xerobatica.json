    "intro": "Silene grandiflora var. xerobatica, commonly known as the desert flax or sand verbena, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers. The plant has adapted to harsh environments through features such as reduced leaf size and deep root systems. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping in dry climates."
