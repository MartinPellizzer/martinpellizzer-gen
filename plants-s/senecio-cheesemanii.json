    "intro": "Senecio cheesemanii, commonly known as Cheeseman's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Senecio cheesemanii is considered a rare and endangered species."
