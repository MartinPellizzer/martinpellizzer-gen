    "intro": "Scabiosa nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada scabious, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of California. It is characterized by its delicate, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and silvery-gray, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Scabiosa nevadensis plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is a symbol of the unique biodiversity of the Sierra Nevada ecosystem."
