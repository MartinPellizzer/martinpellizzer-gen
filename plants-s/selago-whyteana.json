    "intro": "Selago whyteana, commonly known as the coastal daisy or coastal star, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern and western Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a star-like pattern. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to salt-laden winds and coastal conditions. Selago whyteana is often found in dunes and coastal heathlands, contributing to stabilizing sand dunes through its extensive root system. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and nectar for native pollinators in coastal ecosystems."
