    "intro": "Saxifraga cordillerana var. laxa, commonly known as the Sierra saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in rocky, alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptic in shape, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. It is well adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions and is often found in crevices or on rocky slopes."
