    "intro": "Schoenus floridus, commonly known as the Florida sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in its native environment. Schoenus floridus is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
