    "intro": "Sisyrinchium occidentale, commonly known as western blue-eyed grass, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features slender, upright stems covered in narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, sky-blue flowers with prominent yellow centers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
