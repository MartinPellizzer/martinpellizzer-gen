    "intro": "Smilax invenusta, commonly known as the yellow smilax, is a perennial climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features stout, spiny stems that can grow up to 10 meters in length, often climbing over shrubs or trees. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a rough texture and dark green upper surface. Smilax invenusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in partial shade."
