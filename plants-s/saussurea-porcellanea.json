It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and dense clusters of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
