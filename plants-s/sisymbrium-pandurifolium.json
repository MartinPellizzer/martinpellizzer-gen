    "intro": "Sisymbrium pandurifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved shepherd's purse, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, often hairy leaves that are deeply lobed and resemble a purse. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by distinctive triangular or heart-shaped pods. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The species is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal."
