    "intro": "Sipapoantha, commonly known as the purple-flowered orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple petals and a delicate, fragrant aroma. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Sipapoantha is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
