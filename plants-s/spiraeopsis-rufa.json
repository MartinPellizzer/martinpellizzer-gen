    "intro": "Spiraeopsis rufa, commonly known as the red spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features upright, branched stems that are often reddish-brown in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on the previous year's growth. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall. Spiraeopsis rufa thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
