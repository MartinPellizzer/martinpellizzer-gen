    "intro": "Scilla sinensis var. pulchella, commonly known as the Chinese squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to China. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display. The variety is distinguished by its slightly larger and more showy flowers compared to the typical Scilla sinensis."
