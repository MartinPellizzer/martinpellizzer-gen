    "intro": "Stylophyllum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Stylophyllum species are characterized by their distinctive blue or purple flowers, which are often surrounded by bracts that resemble leaves. The plants have a low-growing habit and are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. They play an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
