    "intro": "Saussurea nikoensis var. nikoensis, commonly known as the Niko's safflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and yellow to orange flower heads. The plant produces small, composite flowers that are typically arranged in a single, showy inflorescence at the top of the stem. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
