    "intro": "Sanguisorba minor var. eudictyocarpa, commonly known as the small red sandwort, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, reddish-pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tiny, bead-like fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators."
