    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia subsp. gorodkovii, commonly known as the Siberian rowan, is a subspecies of the rowan tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, displaying a shrub-like form with small, serrated leaves. Its flowers are white and clustered, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The subspecies is notable for its hardiness and adaptability to harsh environmental conditions."
