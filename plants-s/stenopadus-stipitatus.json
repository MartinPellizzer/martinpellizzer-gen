    "intro": "Stenopadus stipitatus, commonly known as the small-leaved marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It typically grows to a height of about 30-60 centimeters and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often dark green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically greenish or brownish in hue. Stenopadus stipitatus thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of ponds. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
