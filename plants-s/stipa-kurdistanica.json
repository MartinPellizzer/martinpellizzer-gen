It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikelets and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, demonstrating a high degree of drought tolerance. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, aiding in its propagation across rugged terrains. Stipa kurdistanica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to harsh climates."
