    "intro": "Suaeda maritima var. humifusa, commonly known as coastal sandmat, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline and arid environments. It thrives in coastal dunes and salt marshes, where it tolerates high salt concentrations in the soil and air. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that reduce water loss and aid in salt excretion. Its flowers are typically pink to red, appearing in clusters during the summer months. This variety is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing sandy soils."
