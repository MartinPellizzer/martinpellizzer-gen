    "intro": "Stevia ophryophylla, commonly known as the white stevia, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its sweet-tasting leaves, which contain steviol glycosides, natural compounds used as a sugar substitute. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Stevia ophryophylla is valued both for its medicinal properties and as a low-calorie sweetener alternative."
