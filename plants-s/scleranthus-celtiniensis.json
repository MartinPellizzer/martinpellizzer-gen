    "intro": "Scleranthus celtiniensis, commonly known as the Celtic sandparsley, is a flowering plant native to the British Isles. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or disturbed habitats. It has small, pinnately divided leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in parts of its range."
