    "intro": "Sedum clausenii, commonly known as the Clausen's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum clausenii is also valued for its ability to prevent soil erosion in rocky or sandy environments."
