It features a low-growing, clump-forming habit with slender, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. Its foliage is typically lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. This variety is distinguished by its dense flowering clusters, which give it its common name."
