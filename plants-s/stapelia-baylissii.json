    "intro": "Stapelia baylissii, commonly known as the Cape Town Stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often ribbed stems. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in arid environments. Stapelia baylissii is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient choice for xerophytic gardens."
