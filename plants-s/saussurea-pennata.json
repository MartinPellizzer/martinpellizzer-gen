    "intro": "Saussurea pennata, commonly known as the Alpine thistle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, woolly, gray-green leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flower heads that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing at high elevations with poor, rocky soils. Saussurea pennata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
