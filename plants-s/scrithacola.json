It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue-violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of tubular flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Scrithacola is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
