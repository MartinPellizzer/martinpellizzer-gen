    "intro": "Spiculaea irritabilis, commonly known as the sensitive spiculaea, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries. The plant is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its leaves are typically small, elliptical, and arranged in whorls around the stem. Spiculaea irritabilis is notable for its sensitive response to touch, as its flowers can close when disturbed, a trait that may aid in pollination by deterring herbivores."
