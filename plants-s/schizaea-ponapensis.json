    "intro": "Schizaea ponapensis, commonly known as the Ponape staghorn fern, is a rare epiphytic fern native to the tropical Pacific islands. It belongs to the family Schizaeaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, antler-like fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures are unique, with sporangia clustered on the undersides of its fronds. Schizaea ponapensis is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in its native habitat."
