    "intro": "Stewartia ovata, commonly known as the Japanese stewartia, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by bright red or orange seed pods that split open to release seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Stewartia ovata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
