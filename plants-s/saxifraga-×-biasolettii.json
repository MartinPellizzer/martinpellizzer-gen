    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 biasolettii, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white or silver hairs. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pink or reddish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in alpine gardens and rockeries."
