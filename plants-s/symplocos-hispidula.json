    "intro": "Symplocos hispidula, commonly known as the hairy wax myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Symplocos hispidula thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its unique foliage and berries make it an important plant for wildlife, particularly birds and small mammals."
