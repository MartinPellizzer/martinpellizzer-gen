    "intro": "Schoenus loreus, commonly known as the tufted flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, poorly drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense, spike-like clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Schoenus loreus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions."
