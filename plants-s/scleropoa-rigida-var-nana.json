    "intro": "Scleropoa rigida var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf rigid grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean. It features narrow, rigid blades that are typically less than 10 cm in height, giving it a compact and dense appearance. The plant is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient component of alpine and rocky habitats."
