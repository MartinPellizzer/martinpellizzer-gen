It is characterized by its woody stems, which are covered in sharp, spiny projections. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough, textured surface. Smilax microscola is often found in moist, wooded areas and is known for its hardy, invasive growth habit."
