    "intro": "Sambucus canadensis acutiloba, commonly known as the arrow-leaved elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arrow-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible when fully ripe but contain toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks."
