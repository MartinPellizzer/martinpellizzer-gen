    "intro": "Stevia divaricata, commonly known as sweetleaf or Brazilian stevia, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite leaves that are lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. Stevia divaricata is widely cultivated for its use in herbal teas and as a sugar substitute due to its intense sweetness."
