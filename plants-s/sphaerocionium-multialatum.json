    "intro": "Sphaerocionium multialatum, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that resemble stars, typically blooming in summer. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Sphaerocionium multialatum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth."
