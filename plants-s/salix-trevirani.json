    "intro": "Salix trevirani, commonly known as the Trier willow, is a rare and ancient species of willow native to the River Rhine region in Germany. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, yellowish-green catkins. The plant has a unique ecological role, often growing in moist, calcareous soils along riverbanks. Its historical significance is reflected in its mention in Roman texts, indicating its use in ancient times. Due to habitat loss, it is now considered critically endangered and protected in its native range."
