    "intro": "Sedum cordifolium, commonly known as the heartleaf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It features fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slightly waxy texture, adapted to store water and withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer, adding a delicate floral display. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its low maintenance and drought tolerance make it an ideal plant for xeriscaping and garden design."
