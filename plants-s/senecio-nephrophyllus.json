    "intro": "Senecio nephrophyllus, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically spoon-shaped and covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Senecio nephrophyllus is also known for its medicinal properties, used traditionally to treat various ailments."
