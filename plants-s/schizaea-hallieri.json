    "intro": "Schizaea hallieri, commonly known as the giant clubmoss, is a member of the family Lycopodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a perennial evergreen plant that can grow up to several meters in height, characterized by its erect, branching stems and needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its branches. Schizaea hallieri thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swamps, where it plays a role in soil stabilization. Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an important species in the study of ancient plant lineages."
