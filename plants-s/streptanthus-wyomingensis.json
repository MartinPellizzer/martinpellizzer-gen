    "intro": "Streptanthus wyomingensis, commonly known as the Wyoming ghostflower, is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of Wyoming. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its short stature and unique floral structure make it a striking yet elusive species in its native environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant."
