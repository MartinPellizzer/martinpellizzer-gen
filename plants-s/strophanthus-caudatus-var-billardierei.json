It is characterized by its striking clusters of yellow, pendulous flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions. The species is also valued for its medicinal properties, though its use requires caution due to the presence of toxic alkaloids."
