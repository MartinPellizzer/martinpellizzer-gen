    "intro": "Stewartia marilandica, commonly known as the Maryland stewartia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are opposite and have a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by ornamental, cone-like fruits. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, with a distinctive flaky texture that becomes more pronounced with age. Stewartia marilandica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively resistant to pests and diseases."
