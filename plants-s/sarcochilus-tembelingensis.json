    "intro": "Sarcochilus tembelingensis, commonly known as the Tembeling sarcocarp, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to Borneo. It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often hairy pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with bright yellow petals and a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in shaded, humid environments within montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered a conservation concern."
