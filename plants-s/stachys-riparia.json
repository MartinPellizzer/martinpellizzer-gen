    "intro": "Stachys riparia, commonly known as waterweed or narrow-leaved hedge-nettle, is a flowering plant native to moist habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with purple or pink petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp environments, often forming dense mats. Stachys riparia is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in herbal medicine."
