    "intro": "Seseli ammi, commonly known as hoary salsify, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and feathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Seseli ammi thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
