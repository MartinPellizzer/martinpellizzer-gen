    "intro": "Secale aestivum, commonly known as winter rye, is a cereal grain native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which contain the tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are harvested in the fall and are used for flour, animal feed, and biofuel production. Botanically, it is closely related to other grasses in the Poaceae family."
