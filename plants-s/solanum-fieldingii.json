    "intro": "Solanum fieldingii, commonly known as the Fielding's nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is often found in humid, forested areas. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, which bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its fruits are berries that mature to a dark purple color, containing several seeds. Solanum fieldingii is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, and it is often used in traditional medicine in its native region."
