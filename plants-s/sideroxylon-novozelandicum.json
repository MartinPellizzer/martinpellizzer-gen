    "intro": "Sideroxylon novozelandicum, commonly known as the New Zealand ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth texture. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries containing seeds. This species is well adapted to the temperate climate of New Zealand and is often found in coastal and lowland forest habitats."
