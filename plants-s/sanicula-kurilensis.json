    "intro": "Sanicula kurilensis, commonly known as the Kuril sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the northern regions of the Pacific Rim, including parts of Russia, Japan, and North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, often hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Sanicula kurilensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
