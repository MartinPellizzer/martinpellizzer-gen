    "intro": "Stipa patulifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often described as feathery in appearance. The plant produces fluffy, silver-white seed heads that are highly ornamental and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Stipa patulifolia thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and landscaping. Its low maintenance requirements and drought tolerance further enhance its appeal in both natural and cultivated settings."
