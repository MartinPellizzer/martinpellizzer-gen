    "intro": "Separotheca pumila, commonly known as the smoothleaf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils. Separotheca pumila is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive with minimal care."
