    "intro": "Salix rhamnifolia subsp. rhamnifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of the Americas. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks, wetlands, and other riparian habitats. The plant features slender, often zigzagging branches and lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 5 cm in length. Its catkins are yellowish-green, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers in early spring. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
