    "intro": "Severinia disticha, commonly known as the twinleaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its berries are red or orange when mature and are edible, though not commonly consumed by humans. Severinia disticha is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
