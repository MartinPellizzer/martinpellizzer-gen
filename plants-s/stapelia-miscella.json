    "intro": "Stapelia miscella, commonly known as the star-shaped stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its unique, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its flowers open in the evening and emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators like flies. Stapelia miscella is a popular choice for collectors due to its striking appearance and ease of care."
