    "intro": "Scirpus vulgaris, commonly known as common bulrush, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It has long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the base, with a fibrous, spongy stem that helps it float. The plant produces small, spike-like flowers that are usually green or brown, arranged in dense clusters. Its roots are extensive and help stabilize soil, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems. Scirpus vulgaris is also valued for its ability to filter water and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
