    "intro": "Saxifraga chrysanthoides, commonly known as the golden saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often blue-green in color, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra-like habitats. Saxifraga chrysanthoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in cold climates."
