    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 fragilis var. discolor, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often pale underneath. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and it is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist environments. Its leaves turn yellow in autumn, contributing to its seasonal beauty. The white willow is also noted for its medicinal uses, particularly in traditional herbal remedies."
