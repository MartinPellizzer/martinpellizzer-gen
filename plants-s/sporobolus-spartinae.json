    "intro": "Sporobolus spartinae, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a flowering plant native to the United States, particularly found in sandy and coastal environments. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and delicate, feathery seed heads. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and wind exposure. Its small, white to pale blue flowers appear in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Sporobolus spartinae plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local wildlife in its native habitats."
