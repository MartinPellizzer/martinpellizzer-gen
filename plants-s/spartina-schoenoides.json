    "intro": "Spartina schoenoides, commonly known as salt marsh cordgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of North America. It thrives in brackish and saline wetlands, playing a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and preventing erosion. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that grow in dense clusters, often reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture that aids in water retention. Spartina schoenoides is also important for supporting diverse wildlife, including birds and invertebrates, in estuarine ecosystems."
