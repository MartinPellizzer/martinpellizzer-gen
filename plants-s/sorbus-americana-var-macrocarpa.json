    "intro": "Sorbus americana var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the American whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 pairs of leaflets, and its distinctive clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that mature in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
