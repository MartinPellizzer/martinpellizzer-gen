    "intro": "Scirpus japonicus, commonly known as Japanese bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in marshy or aquatic environments. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color, and it blooms during the summer months. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats. Scirpus japonicus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting biodiversity."
