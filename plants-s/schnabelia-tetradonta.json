    "intro": "Schnabelia tetradonta, commonly known as the four-toothed snub-nosed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its compact, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a unique floral structure with four prominent teeth on the labellum, which is a distinctive feature in the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Schnabelia tetradonta is considered a species of conservation concern."
