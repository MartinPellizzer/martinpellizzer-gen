    "intro": "Solidago glutinosa var. chlorolepis, commonly known as the sticky goldenrod, is a variant of the goldenrod genus native to North America. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves and bright yellow inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist soils along stream banks and wetlands, preferring partial to full sun. Its narrow, linear leaves are often covered in a sticky resin, which gives it its common name. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
