    "intro": "Stemonurus papuanus, commonly known as the Papuan stemonurus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and relatively understudied species."
