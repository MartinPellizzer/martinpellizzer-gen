    "intro": "Sorbus sambucifolia var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeams, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its compact growth and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
