    "intro": "Sisymbrianthus variifolius, commonly known as the variable shepherd's purse, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive triangular or heart-shaped leaves that vary in size and shape along the stem. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields and along roadsides. Its seeds are encased in a unique, lobed capsule that aids in seed dispersal."
