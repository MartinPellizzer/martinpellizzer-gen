    "intro": "Stopinaca, commonly known as the sacred lotus of ancient Egypt, is a water-lily-like plant that thrived in the Nile River region. It has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with showy white or pink flowers that bloom at dawn. The plant was revered for its symbolic and practical uses, including religious rituals and medicinal applications. Its roots were used as a food source, while its seeds provided oil. Stopinaca played a significant role in Egyptian culture and is often depicted in art and mythology."
