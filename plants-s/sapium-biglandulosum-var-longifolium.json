    "intro": "Sapium biglandulosum var. longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It features alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often pubescent on both surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by orange to red drupes that are attractive to birds. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact."
