It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 1 meter in height, with hairy stems and alternate leaves that are typically ovate or lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, and it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.
