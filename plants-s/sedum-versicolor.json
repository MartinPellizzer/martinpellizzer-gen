    "intro": "Sedum versicolor, commonly known as the variable stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to North America. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and opposite, ovate leaves that range in color from green to reddish-brown. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow to orange flowers in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions."
