    "intro": "Sorbus decaisneana, commonly known as the De Caillie's whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, round berries that turn red in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
