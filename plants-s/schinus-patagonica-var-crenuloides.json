    "intro": "Schinus patagonica var. crenuloides, commonly known as the Patagonian pepper or crenulate poisonwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes other economically important plants like cashew and mango. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to bright red, berry-like fruits. Its bark and leaves contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans if ingested. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though with caution."
