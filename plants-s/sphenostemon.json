    "intro": "Sphenostemon, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, often hairy stems and showy, clustered flowers. The plants typically have simple, opposite leaves and produce small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Sphenostemon species are adapted to harsh environments, with thick leaves and deep root systems to conserve water. They play an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in their native habitats."
