    "intro": "Solanum glaucescens, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, often silver-gray leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, containing numerous seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but is of interest in botanical and ecological studies."
