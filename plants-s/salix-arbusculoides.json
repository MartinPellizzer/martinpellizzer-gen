It is characterized by its small, willow-like leaves and catkin flowers, which are typical of the Salicaceae family. The plant thrives in harsh, cold environments and is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils. Its growth form is low and compact, allowing it to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Salix arbusculoides plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic flora and fauna."
