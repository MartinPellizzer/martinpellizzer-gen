    "intro": "Stapelia chrysostephana, commonly known as the golden star stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, thick stem with fleshy, ribbed leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are yellow with reddish markings, resembling a crown of gold. These flowers open in the early morning and close by midday, attracting pollinators like bees and flies. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for collectors and succulent enthusiasts."
