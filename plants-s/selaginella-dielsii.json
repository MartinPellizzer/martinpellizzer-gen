    "intro": "Selaginella dielsii, commonly known as the tropical clubmoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a distinctive morphology with a prostrate or ascending stem and small, scale-like leaves. Its sporophyte stage produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered along the stem. Selaginella dielsii is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its role in ecological systems as a pioneer species in disturbed habitats."
