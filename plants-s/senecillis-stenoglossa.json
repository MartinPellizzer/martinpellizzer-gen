It typically features slender, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typical of the daisy family. It is native to South Africa and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers full sun and dry conditions."
