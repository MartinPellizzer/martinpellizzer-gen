    "intro": "Schizachyrium angustispiculatum, commonly known as narrow-spined grass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically greenish to brownish in color. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
