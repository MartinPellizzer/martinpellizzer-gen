    "intro": "Saxifraga mutata subsp. mutata, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and arranged in clusters, blooming in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in rock gardens and alpine settings."
