    "intro": "Salix eleagnos, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in riparian zones. Salix eleagnos is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks through its extensive root system."
