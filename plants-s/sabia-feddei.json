    "intro": "Sabia feddei, commonly known as the Fedde's sabia, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red. The plant typically grows from a short, thick rhizome and has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sabia feddei is considered a vulnerable species."
