    "intro": "Stellaria sitchana var. bongardiana, commonly known as the Bongard's starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in star-like clusters, which give it its common name. The plant has slender, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. This variant is closely related to other species in the Stellaria genus, sharing similar botanical characteristics."
