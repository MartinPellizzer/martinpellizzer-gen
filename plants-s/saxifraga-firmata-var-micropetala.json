    "intro": "Saxifraga firmata var. micropetala, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features rosettes of closely packed, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant displays."
