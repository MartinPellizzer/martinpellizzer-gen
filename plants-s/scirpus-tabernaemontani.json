    "intro": "Scirpus tabernaemontani, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in shallow water or moist soils. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in dense stands that help stabilize soil and filter water. Scirpus tabernaemontani plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats by providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
