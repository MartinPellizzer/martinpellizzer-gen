The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, white or pale blue flowers are arranged in dense clusters, often blooming in late winter to early spring. Scolosanthus hispidus is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
