    "intro": "Salvia brachycalyx, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and gray-green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a drought-tolerant choice for xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and showy blooms make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
