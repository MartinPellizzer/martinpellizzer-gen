    "intro": "Stigmaphyllon micranthum, commonly known as the small-flowered stigmaphyllon, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a terrestrial bromeliad characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cup. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in a spike, typical of many bromeliads. Its leaves are often covered in fine trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from herbivores. Stigmaphyllon micranthum is adapted to humid, shaded environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing microhabitats for various organisms."
