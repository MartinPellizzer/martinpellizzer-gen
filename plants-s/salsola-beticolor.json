    "intro": "Salsola beticolor, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its gray-green, succulent leaves and small, greenish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in new regions. Salsola beticolor is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides, where it can compete with crops for resources."
