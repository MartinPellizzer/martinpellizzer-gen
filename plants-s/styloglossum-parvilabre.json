    "intro": "Styloglossum parvilabre, commonly known as the small-lipped orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wet tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically features a short, erect stem with few leaves and a single, spike-like inflorescence bearing small, bilaterally symmetrical flowers. Its flowers have three sepals and three petals, with the lip being notably small and specialized for pollination by specific insects. Styloglossum parvilabre thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests."
