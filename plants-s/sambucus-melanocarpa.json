It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into 5-7 oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, dark purple berries that are rich in antioxidants and used in various culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The flowers, which are white and clustered, appear in early summer and are an important nectar source for pollinators."
