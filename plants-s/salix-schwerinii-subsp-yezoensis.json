    "intro": "Salix schwerinii subsp. yezoensis, commonly known as Yezo willow, is a shrub native to eastern Siberia and parts of northern Japan. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, often boggy environments. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. Its leaves are elliptical, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and they turn yellow in the fall. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
