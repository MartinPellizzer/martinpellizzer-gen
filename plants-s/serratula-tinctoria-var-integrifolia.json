    "intro": "Serratula tinctoria var. integrifolia, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, toothed leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces slender, branched stems that rise from the base, bearing clusters of small, composite flower heads. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its historical use in dyeing fabrics and as a medicinal plant highlights its botanical and cultural significance."
