    "intro": "Senecio silphioides, commonly known as the desert senecio, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with hairy, erect stems that can grow up to 60 centimeters tall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Senecio silphioides is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to drought conditions."
