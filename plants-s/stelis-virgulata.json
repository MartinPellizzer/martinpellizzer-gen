    "intro": "Stelis virgulata, commonly known as the spike orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees or other plants rather than in soil. Stelis virgulata is prized for its delicate appearance and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
