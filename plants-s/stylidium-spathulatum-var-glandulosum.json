It features a basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces delicate, sun-like flowers with yellow petals and a prominent, spurred labellum. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and sandy habitats. Its unique morphology and specialized pollination mechanisms make it an interesting subject in botanical studies."
