    "intro": "Salix arctica var. groenlandica, commonly known as Arctic willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its botanical features make it an important component of tundra ecosystems."
