    "intro": "Solidago wardii, commonly known as Ward's goldenrod, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Georgia. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. Ward's goldenrod is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils."
