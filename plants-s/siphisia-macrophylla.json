    "intro": "Siphisia macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf siphisia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for certain pollinators and its adaptability to dry, rocky soils. Siphisia macrophylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and drought tolerance."
