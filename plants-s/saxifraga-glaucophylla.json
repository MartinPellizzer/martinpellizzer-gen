    "intro": "Saxifraga glaucophylla, commonly known as the blue-leaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of whitish wax. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Saxifraga glaucophylla is well adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
