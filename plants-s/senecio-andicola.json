    "intro": "Senecio andicola, commonly known as the Andean groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Senecio andicola is often found in cloud forests and mountainous areas, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
