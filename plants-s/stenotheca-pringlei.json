    "intro": "Stenotheca pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's bladderpod, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, elongated pods that enclose its seeds. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a low, mat-forming growth habit. Its flowers are simple and usually white or pale yellow, with four petals arranged in a cross shape typical of the Brassicaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
