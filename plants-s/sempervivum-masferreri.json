    "intro": "Sempervivum masferreri, commonly known as the Alpina Carpet, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, flowering stalks in the spring, bearing small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Sempervivum masferreri is known for its hardiness and ability to survive in harsh, cold climates."
