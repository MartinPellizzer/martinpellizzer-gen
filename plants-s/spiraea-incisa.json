    "intro": "Spiraea incisa, commonly known as the cut-leaved spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely cut, serrated leaves that give it a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in early to mid-summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, moist soil. Spiraea incisa is often used in ornamental gardening for its ornate foliage and seasonal blooms."
