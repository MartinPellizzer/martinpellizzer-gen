    "intro": "Sagina crassifolia, commonly known as wooly sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features small, rounded leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or dry meadows. Due to its succulent leaves, it is adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant."
