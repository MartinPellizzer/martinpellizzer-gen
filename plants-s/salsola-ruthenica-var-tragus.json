    "intro": "Salsola ruthenica var. tragus, commonly known as sandmat or Russian thistle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is a halophyte, meaning it can tolerate high levels of salt in the soil, making it adaptable to coastal and saline environments. Salsola ruthenica var. tragus is often considered an invasive species in non-native regions due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils."
