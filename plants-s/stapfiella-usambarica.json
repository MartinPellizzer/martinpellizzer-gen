    "intro": "Stapfiella usambarica, commonly known as the Usambara stapfiella, is a rare and unique plant native to the Usambara Mountains in Tanzania. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often variegated with yellow and green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the cool, misty conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stapfiella usambarica is considered a vulnerable species."
