    "intro": "Syzygium salicifolium, commonly known as the paperbark apple, is a tropical evergreen tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that resembles paper, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by edible, round fruits that are typically red or yellow when ripe. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a waxy surface. Syzygium salicifolium is often found in coastal regions and is adapted to saline and waterlogged soils."
