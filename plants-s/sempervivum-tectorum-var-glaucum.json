    "intro": "Sempervivum tectorum var. glaucum, commonly known as the Blue Roof Sedum, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to the Alps. It features dense rosettes of fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are covered in a powdery waxy coating, known as bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped yellow flowers in late spring or early summer. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in a wide range of climates, including cold, alpine conditions."
