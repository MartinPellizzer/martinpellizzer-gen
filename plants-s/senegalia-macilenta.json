    "intro": "Senegalia macilenta, commonly known as the slender acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact inflorescences, followed by small, woody pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a capacity for nitrogen fixation. Senegalia macilenta is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of fuel and forage."
