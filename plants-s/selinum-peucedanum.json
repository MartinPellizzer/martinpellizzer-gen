    "intro": "Selinum peucedanum, commonly known as hemlock weed, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. Due to its toxic compounds, it is considered a harmful plant and should be handled with care."
