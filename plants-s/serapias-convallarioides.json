    "intro": "Serapias convallarioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Serapias convallarioides thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sun-exposed areas."
