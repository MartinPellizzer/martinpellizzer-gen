    "intro": "Stelis mantae, commonly known as the Mantae orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Philippines. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Stelis mantae is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
