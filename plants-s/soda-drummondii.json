    "intro": "Soda drummondii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access groundwater. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Soda drummondii plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
