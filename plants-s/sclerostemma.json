    "intro": "Sclerostemma, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family. These plants are characterized by their unique, often showy flowers that are adapted to thrive in rocky or arid environments. Sclerostemma species typically have thick, fleshy leaves that help them conserve water in dry conditions. They are native to regions of southern Africa, where they grow in rocky outcrops and coastal areas. The genus is noted for its specialized pollination mechanisms, often involving specific insect pollinators."
