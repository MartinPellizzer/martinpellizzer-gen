    "intro": "Salvia semilanata, commonly known as the woolly sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, silvery appearance. The plant produces showy blue to violet flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, Salvia semilanata is widely cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
