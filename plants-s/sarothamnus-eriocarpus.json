    "intro": "Sarothamnus eriocarpus, commonly known as the woolly thornstep, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by narrow, winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Sarothamnus eriocarpus is well adapted to drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
