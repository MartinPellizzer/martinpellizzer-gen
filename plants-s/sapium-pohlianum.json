    "intro": "Sapium pohlianum, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by woody, spherical fruits that split open to release seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value but can become invasive in certain regions. The species is also valued for its hard, durable wood."
