    "intro": "Swietenia alternifolia, commonly known as the Honduras mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central America and the Caribbean. It belongs to the Meliaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, aromatic wood and striking, alternate foliage. The leaves are typically elliptical with a glossy surface and a serrated edge. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. This species is valued for its durable, high-quality timber but is also threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
