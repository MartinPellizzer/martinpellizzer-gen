    "intro": "Scirpus depressus, commonly known as the flat bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats. Scirpus depressus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms."
