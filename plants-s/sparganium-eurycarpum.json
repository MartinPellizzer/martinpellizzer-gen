    "intro": "Sparganium eurycarpum, commonly known as the broad-fruited bur reed, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and shallow waters of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems that often grow in dense clusters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces distinctive, spiky, yellowish-brown inflorescences that contain small, clustered flowers. Its fruits are large, round, and covered in hooked bracts, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. Sparganium eurycarpum plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
