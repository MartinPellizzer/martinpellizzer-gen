    "intro": "Salix kangensis, commonly known as the Kangxi willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and has small, ovate leaves with a rough texture. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
