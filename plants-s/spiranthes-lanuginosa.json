    "intro": "Spiranthes lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly spider orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, spiraling inflorescence of white to pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, fibrous roots that help anchor it in its wetland habitat. Spiranthes lanuginosa is often found in open, sunny areas and is known for its subtle, fragrant blooms that attract various pollinators."
