    "intro": "Silene sylvestris, commonly known as the woodland catchfly, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. Silene sylvestris is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in supporting pollinators."
