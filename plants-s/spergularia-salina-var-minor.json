    "intro": "Spergularia salina var. minor, commonly known as saltmarsh sandwort, is a low-growing annual plant native to coastal areas. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences and are usually pink or white in color. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
