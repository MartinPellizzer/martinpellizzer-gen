    "intro": "Stipa compressa, commonly known as needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open woodlands, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of 30 to 100 centimeters. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often compressed and smooth to the touch. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical cluster of spikelets, which are usually pale green to brown in color. Stipa compressa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
