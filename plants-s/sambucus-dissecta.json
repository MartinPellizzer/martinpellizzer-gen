    "intro": "Sambucus dissecta, commonly known as the red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a reddish tint. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. Sambucus dissecta typically grows in moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and streambanks."
