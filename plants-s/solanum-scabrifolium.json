    "intro": "Solanum scabrifolium, commonly known as the rough-leaved nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and small, violet flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, and they contain toxic alkaloids. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
