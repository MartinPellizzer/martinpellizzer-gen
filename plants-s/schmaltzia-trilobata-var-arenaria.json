    "intro": "Schmaltzia trilobata var. arenaria, commonly known as sand schmaltzia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features small, gray-green, succulent leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Schmaltzia trilobata var. arenaria is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
