    "intro": "Saxifraga muscoides var. moschata, commonly known as the musk saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, fuzzy layer. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or tundra environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cooler climates."
