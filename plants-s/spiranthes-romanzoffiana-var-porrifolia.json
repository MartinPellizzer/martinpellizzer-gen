    "intro": "Spiranthes romanzoffiana var. porrifolia, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiraled inflorescence of pink to lavender flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its leaves are grass-like and form a basal rosette, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. This variety is notable for its delicate appearance and ecological importance as a pollinator attractant."
