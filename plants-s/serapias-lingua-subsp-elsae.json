    "intro": "Serapias lingua subsp. elsae, commonly known as the Canary Island orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Canary Islands. It is a herbaceous perennial with striking orange and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it survive in its arid environment. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
