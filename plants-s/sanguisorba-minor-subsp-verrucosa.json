    "intro": "Sanguisorba minor subsp. verrucosa, commonly known as the woolly stonecrop, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, reddish-brown flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
