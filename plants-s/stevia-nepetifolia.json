    "intro": "Stevia nepetifolia, commonly known as Mexican stevia, is a perennial shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, green, serrated leaves. The plant produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Stevia nepetifolia is known for its sweet-tasting leaves, which contain high levels of steviol glycosides, making it a natural sweetener. However, it is less commonly used than Stevia rebaudiana for commercial purposes."
