    "intro": "Syringodea echiiflora, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Syringodea echiiflora has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
