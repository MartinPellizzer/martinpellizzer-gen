    "intro": "Scleria flexuosa, commonly known as the slender marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly bent or flexed. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny white or pale blue flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a slight sheen, which helps in identifying the species. Scleria flexuosa is adapted to waterlogged soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
