    "intro": "Sorbus lonetalensis, commonly known as the Kashmir whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and turn yellow in autumn, contributing to its ornamental value."
