    "intro": "Santolina chamaecyparissus var. intricata, commonly known as the ornamental santolina, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, silvery-gray foliage that is aromatic and drought-tolerant, making it ideal for rock gardens or borders. The plant produces small, yellow flower clusters in early summer, adding a subtle ornamental touch. Its foliage is composed of narrow, needle-like leaves that are tightly packed, giving it a distinctive, tufted appearance. This variety is prized for its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained soils with full sun exposure."
