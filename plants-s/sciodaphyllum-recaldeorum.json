    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum recaldeorum, commonly known as the Caldeira mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It relies on host trees for water and nutrients, while it provides some photosynthesis through its own leaves. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white flowers. It is adapted to thrive in shaded, humid environments within the forest canopy. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
