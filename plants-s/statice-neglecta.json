    "intro": "Statice neglecta, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its narrow, gray-green leaves are adapted to withstand coastal winds and salt spray. Statice neglecta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
