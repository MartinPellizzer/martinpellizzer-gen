    "intro": "Salix longebracteata, commonly known as the long bract willow, is a species of willow native to China. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and its distinctive, elongated bracts that are typically yellow-green in color. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers that are pollinated by wind, a common trait among willow species. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface, depending on the variety. Salix longebracteata is often found in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and in mountainous regions."
