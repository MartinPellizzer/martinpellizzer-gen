It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and prefers well-drained soil in full sun. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
