    "intro": "Selaginella arenicola var. riddellii, commonly known as the sand spikerush, is a species of spikemoss found in arid and semi-arid environments. It is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. It is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils through its ability to retain water and form dense mats. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
