    "intro": "Sabulina nerimaniae, commonly known as the narrowleaf sabulina, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers and herbaceous growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, adapting to the harsh climatic conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sabulina nerimaniae is considered a species of conservation concern."
