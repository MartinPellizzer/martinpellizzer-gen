    "intro": "Salix arctica var. kophophylla, commonly known as the Arctic willow with clustered leaves, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, alternate leaves that are often clustered at the ends of the stems. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in harsh, cold environments and is adapted to low light conditions. Its woody structure and compact growth form help it survive in nutrient-poor, permafrost-dominated soils."
