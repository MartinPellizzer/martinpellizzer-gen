    "intro": "Spachea elegans, commonly known as the elegant spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though its toxic sap requires caution during handling."
