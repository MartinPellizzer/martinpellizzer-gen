    "intro": "Samanea leucocalyx, commonly known as the white-flowered acacia, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces long, flat pods containing small, hard seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas. Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes cultivated for reforestation and landscaping purposes."
