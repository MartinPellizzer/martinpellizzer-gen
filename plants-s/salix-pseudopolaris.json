    "intro": "Salix pseudopolaris, commonly known as the polar willow, is a shrub native to Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, triangular leaves. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers early in the growing season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Due to its adaptations to cold climates, it plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
