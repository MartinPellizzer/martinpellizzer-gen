    "intro": "Spiraea hypericifolia subsp. hypericifolia, commonly known as the redleaf spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features slender, arching stems that produce clusters of small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early summer. The plant has compound leaves with finely serrated margins, which turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its showy flowers and seasonal color changes."
