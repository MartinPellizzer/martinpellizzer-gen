    "intro": "Sarratia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, and is often found in shaded, moist environments. The plant has no leaves, relying solely on its roots for nutrient absorption. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with a unique, orchid-like appearance. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Sarratia is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
