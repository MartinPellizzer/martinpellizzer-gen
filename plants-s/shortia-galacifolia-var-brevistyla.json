    "intro": "Shortia galacifolia var. brevistyla, commonly known as the dwarf shortia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and rocky slopes. Its leaves are elliptical and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
