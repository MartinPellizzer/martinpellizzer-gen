    "intro": "Stipa himalaica, commonly known as Himalayan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand harsh mountain conditions. Stipa himalaica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
