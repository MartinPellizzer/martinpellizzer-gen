    "intro": "Shorea hypochra, commonly known as white ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for construction and furniture. The plant typically grows in lowland and hill dipterocarp forests, often reaching heights of up to 40 meters. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a smooth surface, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural propagation in forest ecosystems."
