It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, clustered leaves that form a dense, compact rosette. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in the spring, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
