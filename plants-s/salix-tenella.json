    "intro": "Salix tenella, commonly known as the creeping willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the northern regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and slender, willow-like branches that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Salix tenella thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and along the edges of ponds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
