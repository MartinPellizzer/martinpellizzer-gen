    "intro": "Spiraea \u00d7 conferta, commonly known as the weeping spiraea, is a hybrid shrub that combines traits from Spiraea prairie and Spiraea japonica. It is characterized by its cascading, arching branches that bear clusters of small, white or pink flowers in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is dark green and provides attractive contrast to the flowering display. Spiraea \u00d7 conferta is well-suited for landscaping due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
