    "intro": "Struthiopteris polypodioides f. fallax, commonly known as the fallax form of the broad fern, is a fern species characterized by its large, broad, and often deeply lobed fronds. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to regions of the northern hemisphere, including parts of Europe and Asia. The fronds are typically dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, with a distinctive, rugged texture. This form is notable for its variability in morphology, which can include differences in frond shape and size compared to the typical form of the species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
