It belongs to the family Haemodoraceae and is characterized by its erect, often hairy stems and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typically blooming in spring. Its thick, fleshy roots are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments.
