    "intro": "Stellaria molluginea, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from spring to early summer. The plant has oval, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, fields, and along roadsides. Stellaria molluginea is known for its ability to spread rapidly through seed production and is considered a common weed in many agricultural and garden settings."
