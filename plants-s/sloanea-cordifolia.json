    "intro": "Sloanea cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf sloanea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically glossy and dark green, and its small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Sloanea cordifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal. It has also been used in traditional medicine for its potential healing properties."
