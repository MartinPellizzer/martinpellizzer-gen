    "intro": "Symplocos bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, showy berries that display a unique color transition from white to deep purple as they mature. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in racemes, appearing in the spring before the leaves fully emerge. Symplocos bicolor thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in moist, woodland habitats."
