    "intro": "Sebastiania glaucophylla, commonly known as the silver-leafed sebastiania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its attractive, waxy, silver-green leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, which are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
