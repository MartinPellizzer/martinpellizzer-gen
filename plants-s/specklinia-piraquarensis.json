    "intro": "Specklinia piraquarensis, commonly known as the Piraquarensis staghorn fern, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its unique, branching fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, porous growing media such as bark or moss. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sporangia, are typically found on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
