    "intro": "Scilla bifolia subsp. laxa, commonly known as the looseleaf squill, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features grass-like basal leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in open woodlands and scrublands. Its bulbs are used in traditional medicine and as a source of ornamental plants. The subspecies laxa is distinguished by its more loosely arranged flowers compared to other subspecies of Scilla bifolia."
