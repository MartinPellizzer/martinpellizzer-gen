It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a stem that is usually less than 10 centimeters tall, with whorled leaves that are often bright green and lance-shaped. Selaginella concinna is characterized by its spore-producing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its branches.
