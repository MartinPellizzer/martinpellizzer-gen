    "intro": "Saxifraga rhomboidea, commonly known as the rhomboid saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, rhomboid-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, typically arranged in a compact cluster at the center of the rosette. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Saxifraga rhomboidea is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
