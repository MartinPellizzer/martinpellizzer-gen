It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to the humid understory of rainforests in Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in low-light conditions, making it well-suited for shaded environments. Its distinctive bifurcated leaves, which split into two branches, give it its common name. Sciodaphyllum bifurcatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and air-purifying properties."
