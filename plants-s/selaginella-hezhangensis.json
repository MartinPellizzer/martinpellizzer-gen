    "intro": "Selaginella hezhangensis, commonly known as the Hezhang spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus, which contains the plant's spores. Native to China, this species thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its morphology reflects evolutionary adaptations to arid conditions, with specialized structures for water retention. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research."
