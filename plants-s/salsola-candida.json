It is a low-growing annual or perennial herb that typically thrives in arid and saline environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession. Salsola candida is also known for its ability to tolerate high levels of salt and drought, making it well adapted to harsh climates."
