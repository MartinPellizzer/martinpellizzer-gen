    "intro": "Sarcostemma intermedium, commonly known as the middle sarcostemma, is a climbing shrub belonging to the family Asclepiadaceae. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by distinctive, follicle-like fruits. It is native to southern Africa and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
