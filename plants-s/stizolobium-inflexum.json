    "intro": "Stizolobium inflexum, commonly known as the African tamarind, is a small to medium-sized leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its distinctive yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, woody pods containing flat, edible seeds, which are often used in traditional cuisine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry to semi-arid climates, making it a valuable species in arid regions. Stizolobium inflexum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and potential for soil stabilization in degraded landscapes."
