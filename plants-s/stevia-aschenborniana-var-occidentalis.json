    "intro": "Stevia aschenborniana var. occidentalis, commonly known as western sweetleaf, is a perennial herb native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves. The plant is notable for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners that are significantly sweeter than table sugar. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Due to its low caloric content and health benefits, it is often used as a natural sweetener in herbal teas and food products."
