    "intro": "Stomatium meyeri, commonly known as the Meyer's stomatium, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant features finely divided, feathery leaves that are often mistaken for those of other similar species. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it blooms during the cool seasons. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Stomatium meyeri is considered a species of conservation concern."
