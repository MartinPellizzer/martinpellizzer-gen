    "intro": "Sempervivum castello-paivae, commonly known as the Castello-Paiva houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the Pyrenees region. It features rosettes of fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are densely packed and often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in cold climates, though it may go dormant in extreme winter conditions."
