    "intro": "Solanum litocladum, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by spherical, green berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
