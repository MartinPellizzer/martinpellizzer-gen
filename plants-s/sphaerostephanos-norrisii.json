    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos norrisii, commonly known as the Norris's globe-stephanos, is a rare and unusual plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, globe-shaped inflorescence, which consists of tightly clustered, small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has a short, herbaceous stem with opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a critically endangered species."
