    "intro": "Steiractinia rusbyana, commonly known as the Rusby's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals and sepals that resemble ghostly apparitions. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing on tree branches or rocks in cloud forests. Its flowers are typically pale green or white, with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Steiractinia rusbyana is considered a critically endangered species."
