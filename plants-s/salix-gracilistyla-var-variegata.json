It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that exhibit a striking variegation of white and green. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its adaptability to moist, well-drained soils makes it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. The variegated foliage adds visual interest and enhances its aesthetic appeal in garden settings."
