    "intro": "Sesuvium brevifolium, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a succulent species characterized by its fleshy, often blue-green leaves and small, pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high salinity and strong coastal winds. Its shallow root system allows it to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. Sesuvium brevifolium is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in harsh environments."
