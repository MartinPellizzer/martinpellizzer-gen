    "intro": "Scaevola taccada var. bryanii, commonly known as the silver mistflower, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom throughout the year, creating a soft, mist-like appearance. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-gray pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for coastal gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
