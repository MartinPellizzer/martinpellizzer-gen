    "intro": "Scalesia darwinii, commonly known as Darwin's scaleia, is a striking member of the Campanulaceae family native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is characterized by its large, showy, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, often reaching up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant has a tree-like growth habit, with a single trunk and broad, leathery leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern. It thrives in the humid, volcanic soils of the highland areas of the Gal\u00e1pagos. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a key species in the region's endemic flora."
