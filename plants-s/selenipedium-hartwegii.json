    "intro": "Selenipedium hartwegii, commonly known as the giant panicle orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that can reach up to 3 meters in height, composed of numerous pale green to white flowers. The plant is a monocot with a rhizomatous root system and possesses long, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species and is often protected in its natural range."
