    "intro": "Schmidelia rubifolia, commonly known as the red-leaf schmidelia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking red to orange-red leaves, which are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are typically clustered near the base of the leaves. Schmidelia rubifolia thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers cool, humid conditions. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant foliage and compact form."
