    "intro": "Scirpus acicularis var. fluitans, commonly known as the floating bulrush, is a wetland plant characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that float on the water surface. It thrives in shallow water environments such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or reddish in color. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Scirpus acicularis var. fluitans plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
