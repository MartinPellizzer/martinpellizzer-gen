    "intro": "Striga hermonthica, commonly known as the witchweed, is a parasitic plant that primarily affects cereal crops such as maize. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, attaching itself via haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short life cycle, often completing its development within a few weeks. Its seeds can remain viable in the soil for years, making it a persistent agricultural pest. The plant's ability to rapidly deplete host resources can lead to significant crop losses in affected regions."
