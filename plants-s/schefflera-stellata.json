    "intro": "Schefflera stellata, commonly known as the star schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and clusters of small, dark green leaves that give it a star-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as a decorative plant indoors or in shaded outdoor gardens. Its adaptability and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for horticultural purposes."
