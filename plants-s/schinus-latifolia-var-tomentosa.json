It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and have a velvety, grayish underside due to the dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various birds and wildlife. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value, though it can become invasive in certain regions. The species is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices."
