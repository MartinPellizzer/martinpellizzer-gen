    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos polisianus, commonly known as the Polisianus starflower, is a rare and striking member of the Primulaceae family. It is characterized by its spherical, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in a compact inflorescence. Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe, it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
