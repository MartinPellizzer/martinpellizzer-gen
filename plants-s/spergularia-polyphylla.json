    "intro": "Spergularia polyphylla, commonly known as the many-leafed sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in disturbed or open habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are typically lobed or toothed, and the stems are often prostrate or ascending. Spergularia polyphylla is adapted to withstand drought and salt spray, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
