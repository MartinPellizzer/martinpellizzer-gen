    "intro": "Solanum andigenum var. hederiforme, commonly known as the Andean nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude regions. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
