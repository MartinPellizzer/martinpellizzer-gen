It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray leaves and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often used in ornamental gardening. Stipa gynerioides thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
