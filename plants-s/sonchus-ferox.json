    "intro": "Sonchus ferox, commonly known as the hairy bittercress, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaves. The plant has alternate, hairy, and serrated leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. Sonchus ferox is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
