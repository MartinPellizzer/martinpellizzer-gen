    "intro": "Salix sitchensis var. denudata, commonly known as the Sitka willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in wet, coastal environments. The plant has smooth, gray-brown bark that peels in thin layers, and its leaves are elongated, lance-shaped, and often reddish when young. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are important for pollinators. This variety is notable for its adaptability to moist soils and its role in stabilizing stream banks and coastal areas."
