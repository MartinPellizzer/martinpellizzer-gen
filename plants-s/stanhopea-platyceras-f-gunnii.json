    "intro": "Stanhopea platyceras f. gunnii, commonly known as the Gunni's broad-cup stanhopea, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Ecuador. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with vibrant yellow and orange petals, which bloom during the dry season. The plant has a pseudobulbous structure, typical of many orchids, and produces long, slender roots adapted to its rocky and humid habitat. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
