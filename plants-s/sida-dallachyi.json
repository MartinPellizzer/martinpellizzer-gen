    "intro": "Sida dallachyi, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or subshrub with hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in summer. Its fibrous stems and leaves are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant. Sida dallachyi plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals."
