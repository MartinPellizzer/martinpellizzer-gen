    "intro": "Selaginella rachipterygia, commonly known as the climbing spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an important subject in the study of early land plant evolution."
