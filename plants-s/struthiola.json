It consists of several species native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina and Chile. The plants are characterized by their silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, often found in dry, arid environments. Struthiola species are valued for their ornamental appeal and have been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
