    "intro": "Sinolimprichtia alpina var. dissecta, commonly known as the Alpine dissected bellflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and showy, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in rocky or mountainous habitats. It is a perennial species that blooms from late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
