    "intro": "Semiphajus evrardii, commonly known as the Evrard's semipajus, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its intricate, showy floral structures. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical rainforests, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are often fragrant and exhibit a complex coloration pattern, which plays a role in attracting specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Semiphajus evrardii is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
