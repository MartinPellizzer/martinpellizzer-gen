    "intro": "Selaginella lutchuensis, commonly known as the Lutchuens Island spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss found in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures called strobila. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of moss-like tissue, which helps in water retention. Selaginella lutchuensis is an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitats."
