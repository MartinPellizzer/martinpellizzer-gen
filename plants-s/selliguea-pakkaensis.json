    "intro": "Selliguea pakkaensis, commonly known as the Pakkanese moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, acrocarpous moss that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth form with closely packed, greenish-yellow to reddish-brown leaves. Its reproductive structures, called capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature. Selliguea pakkaensis is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, contributing to the biodiversity of understory ecosystems."
