    "intro": "Salpianthus, commonly known as the yellow wood or red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. These plants are native to the Americas, particularly found in regions of Mexico and the southwestern United States. Salpianthus species are characterized by their striking yellow flowers and their ability to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. The genus includes several species, such as Salpianthus vermicularis and Salpianthus acutifolius, which are valued for their ornamental and ecological significance. Botanically, they are legumes, meaning they have the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria."
