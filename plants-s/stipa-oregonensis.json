    "intro": "Stipa oregonensis, commonly known as Oregon needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and produces tall, narrow seed heads that are often tinged with red or purple. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its deep root system helps it survive in arid conditions and prevents soil erosion. Stipa oregonensis plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native environment."
