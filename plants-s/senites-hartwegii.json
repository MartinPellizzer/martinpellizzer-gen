    "intro": "Senites hartwegii, commonly known as the Hartweg's senita, is a succulent cactus native to the Sonoran Desert of North America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a cushion-like growth, often reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring, which are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its leaves are reduced to tubercles, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid conditions. Senites hartwegii is valued for its resilience and is often found in rocky habitats where it thrives with minimal water."
