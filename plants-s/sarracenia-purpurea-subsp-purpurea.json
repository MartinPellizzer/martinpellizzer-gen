    "intro": "Sarracenia purpurea subsp. purpurea, commonly known as the purple pitcher plant, is a striking carnivorous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, red to purple-colored leaves that function as pitfall traps to capture insects. The plant's leaves are lined with a slippery waxy coating that prevents prey from escaping. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor wetlands and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
