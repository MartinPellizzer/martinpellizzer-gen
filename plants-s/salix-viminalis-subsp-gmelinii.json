    "intro": "Salix viminalis subsp. gmelinii, commonly known as the Mongolian willow, is a shrub or small tree native to northern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and grayish bark that exfoliates easily. The leaves are typically narrow, lanceolate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in riparian zones and wet meadows. This subspecies is notable for its use in basket-making and as a source of flexible branches."
