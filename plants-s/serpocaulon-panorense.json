    "intro": "Serpocaulon panorense, commonly known as the Panorama serpentine, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the island of Panorama in the South Pacific. It is a member of the family Hypoxidaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and dark green, strap-like leaves. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, serpentine soils, which are rich in magnesium and poor in calcium, making it a unique ecological indicator species. Serpocaulon panorense produces small, white flowers that bloom during the wet season, and it is often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat destruction."
