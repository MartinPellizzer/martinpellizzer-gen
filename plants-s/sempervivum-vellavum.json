It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and containers. Sempervivum vellavum is also known for its ability to propagate easily through offsets, which contribute to its popularity among gardeners."
