    "intro": "Scoparia annua, commonly known as annual scoparia, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm and has slender, branched stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in loose clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a slightly rough texture. Scoparia annua is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in full sun."
