    "intro": "Sporobolus stolzii, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a blue-green hue that adds ornamental value to landscapes. Sporobolus stolzii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to stabilize soil."
