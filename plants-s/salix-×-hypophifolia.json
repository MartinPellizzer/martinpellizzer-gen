    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 hypophifolia, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its long, cascading branches that create a distinctive weeping appearance. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically light green on the upper surface and pale white or silver on the underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated. The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal."
