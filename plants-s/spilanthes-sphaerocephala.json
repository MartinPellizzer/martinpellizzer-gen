    "intro": "Spilanthes sphaerocephala, commonly known as the globe flower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive spherical inflorescence, which consists of numerous small, yellowish flowers clustered together. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, producing a striking visual display. Spilanthes sphaerocephala is also valued for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses attributed to its alkaloid content."
