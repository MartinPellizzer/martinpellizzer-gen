    "intro": "Scilla mixta, commonly known as the mixed scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 cm and thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils. It is often found in woodland edges and open meadows, where it forms dense colonies. Scilla mixta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and ability to naturalize readily in suitable climates."
