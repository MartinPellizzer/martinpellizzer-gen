    "intro": "Seseli eriocarpum, commonly known as the woolly seseli, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed structure called a schizocarp, which splits into two one-seeded parts upon maturity. Seseli eriocarpum is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
