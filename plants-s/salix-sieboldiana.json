    "intro": "Salix sieboldiana, commonly known as the Japanese weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and wetlands. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate regions."
