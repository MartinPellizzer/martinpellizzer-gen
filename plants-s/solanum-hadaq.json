    "intro": "Solanum hadaq, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers and berries that ripen to a deep red or black color. Solanum hadaq is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often with deep roots and thick foliage to reduce water loss. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its toxicity requires caution."
