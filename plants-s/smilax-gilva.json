    "intro": "Smilax gilva, commonly known as yellow smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red berries in the fall. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, often forming dense thickets. Smilax gilva is adapted to a variety of soil types and thrives in partial to full shade."
