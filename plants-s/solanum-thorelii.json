    "intro": "Solanum thorelii, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Solanum thorelii is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other well-known plants such as tomatoes and potatoes."
