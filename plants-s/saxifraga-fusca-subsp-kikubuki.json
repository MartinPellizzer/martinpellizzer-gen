    "intro": "Saxifraga fusca subsp. kikubuki, commonly known as the Japanese saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It typically features rosettes of dark green, velvety leaves with a bluish tinge, and produces small, white or pinkish flowers in the spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in garden settings with appropriate conditions. The subspecies is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences from other saxifrage species."
