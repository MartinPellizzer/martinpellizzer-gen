    "intro": "Spiraea filipendula var. pubescens, commonly known as the downy spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features slender, arching stems that are covered in a fine, fuzzy layer of white pubescence, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are oval-shaped, serrated, and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a versatile choice for landscaping."
