    "intro": "Sesleria nitida var. pulchella, commonly known as the slender tussock grass, is a compact, low-growing perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features fine, silver-blue blades that form dense, tufted clumps, giving it a soft, ornamental appearance. The plant produces delicate, white to pale blue flower spikes in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its drought tolerance and ability to form attractive ground cover make it a popular choice in Mediterranean-style gardens."
