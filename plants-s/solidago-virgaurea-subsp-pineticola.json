    "intro": "Solidago virgaurea subsp. pineticola, commonly known as the pine barrens goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils, often in open woodlands or pine barrens. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor environments. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
