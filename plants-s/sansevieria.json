It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped leaves that are often variegated with yellow or white markings. The plant is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in low-light conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Sansevieria species are also known for their ability to purify the air by removing toxins such as formaldehyde and benzene. Its resilience and low maintenance requirements have made it a symbol of good luck and prosperity in many cultures."
