    "intro": "Shortia soldanelloides, commonly known as the Carolina lily, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and stream banks. It has opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and requires careful conservation efforts."
