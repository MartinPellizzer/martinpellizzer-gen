    "intro": "Salix humboldtiana var. martiana, commonly known as the Humboldt's willow or the golden weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are important for pollination by wind. Its rapid growth rate and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. The plant thrives in moist soils and is often found near water sources such as rivers and wetlands."
