    "intro": "Sorbus glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and alternate, simple leaves. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers in spring, followed by small, orange-red berries in the autumn. It is often found in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
