    "intro": "Stichorkis compressa, commonly known as the narrowleaf stichorkis, is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, often found in Mediterranean regions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its botanical structure supports its adaptation to arid environments, with reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss. Stichorkis compressa is noted for its resilience and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
