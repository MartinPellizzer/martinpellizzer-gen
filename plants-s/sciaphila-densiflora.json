    "intro": "Sciaphila densiflora, commonly known as the denseflower ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, vine-like stems and its ability to grow epiphytically on trees, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered densely along the stems. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Its botanical features make it a unique and challenging subject for horticultural study and conservation efforts."
