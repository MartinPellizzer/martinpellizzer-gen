    "intro": "Subpilocereus repandus subsp. micracanthus, commonly known as the narrow-spined night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique morphology and nocturnal blooming habit make it a striking addition to succulent collections."
