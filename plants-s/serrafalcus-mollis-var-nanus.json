    "intro": "Serrafalcus mollis var. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf serrated fern, is a compact, low-growing fern species native to tropical regions. It features delicate, serrated fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length, giving it a finely textured appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Its small size makes it ideal for container gardening or as a ground cover in shaded gardens. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to add a lush, green texture to indoor and outdoor spaces."
