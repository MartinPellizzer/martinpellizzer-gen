It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant has serrated leaves that are typically hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Serraea rupestris is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
