    "intro": "Silene aprica var. firma, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Silene aprica var. firma is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions."
