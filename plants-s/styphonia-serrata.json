    "intro": "Styphonia serrata, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often serrated, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces bright orange or red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Styphonia serrata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils in full sun."
