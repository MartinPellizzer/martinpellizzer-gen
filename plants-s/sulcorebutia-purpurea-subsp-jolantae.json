It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and thick, ribbed stems that store water. The plant produces vibrant purple flowers during the warmer months, adding visual interest to its appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
