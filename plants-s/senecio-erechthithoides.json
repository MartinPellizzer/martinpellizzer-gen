It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a low-growing rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Senecio erechthithoides is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
