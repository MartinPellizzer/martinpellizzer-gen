    "intro": "Stuckenia \u00d7 fennica, commonly known as the common water plantain, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Stuckenia palustris and Stuckenia triqueta. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. Stuckenia \u00d7 fennica plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for aquatic invertebrates and waterfowl."
