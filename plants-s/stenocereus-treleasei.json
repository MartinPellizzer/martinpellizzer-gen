    "intro": "Stenocereus treleasei, commonly known as the night-blooming organ pipe cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive ribbed structure and spiny areoles. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The species is also known for its ability to regenerate after disturbances, making it resilient in its native habitat."
