    "intro": "Saussurea grubovii, commonly known as the Tibetan snow lotus, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and dense clusters of small, yellowish to white flowers. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to grow at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
