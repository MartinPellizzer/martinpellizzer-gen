It is an erect, shrub-like species that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
