    "intro": "Schefflera myrianthella, commonly known as the African umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like crown of large, palmately compound leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for shaded garden environments. Schefflera myrianthella is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to add vertical interest to landscapes."
