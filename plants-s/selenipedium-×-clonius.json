    "intro": "Selenipedium \u00d7 clonius, commonly known as the giant spider orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy, spider-like flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its botanical features include strap-like leaves and a complex inflorescence with multiple flower spikes. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in many regions."
