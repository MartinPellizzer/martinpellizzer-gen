    "intro": "Sorbus glabrata, commonly known as the smooth whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have serrated edges. Sorbus glabrata is often found in woodland edges and rocky areas, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
