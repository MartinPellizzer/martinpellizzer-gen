It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a spherical, green berry that turns red when mature, containing a single seed. The leaves are hairy, hence the common name, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded environments."
