    "intro": "Stelis longissima, commonly known as the long-stemmed orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and elongated stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Stelis longissima is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
