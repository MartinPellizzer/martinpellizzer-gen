    "intro": "Silene scabriflora subsp. gallaecica, commonly known as the Galician sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
