It is characterized by its delicate, yellowish-green foliage and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. It thrives in coastal and dry forest habitats, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
