    "intro": "Sedum whitmannii, commonly known as Whitman's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ability to store water in its leaves make it an adaptable species for arid environments."
