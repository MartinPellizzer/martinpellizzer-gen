    "intro": "Serruria decumbens, commonly known as the Cape snowbush, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, adding ornamental value to gardens. The plant has linear, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid native environment. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit. Serruria decumbens is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
