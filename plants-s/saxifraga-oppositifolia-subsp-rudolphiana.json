    "intro": "Saxifraga oppositifolia subsp. rudolphiana, commonly known as the Arctic sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in rocky and barren environments, often found on tundra and mountain slopes. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically succulent and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it conserve moisture in harsh conditions. It is well-adapted to cold climates and can survive in nutrient-poor soils."
