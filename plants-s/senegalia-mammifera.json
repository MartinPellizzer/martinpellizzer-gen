    "intro": "Senegalia mammifera, commonly known as the honey mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically bipinnate and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by long, slender pods containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to access groundwater. Senegalia mammifera is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a source of forage for livestock."
