    "intro": "Solanum semiarmatum, commonly known as the sandhill nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, yellowish berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its toxicity, it is typically avoided by livestock and wildlife."
