    "intro": "Solanum steironematophyllum, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom at night. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds, and it is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Despite its ornamental appeal, it can be toxic if ingested, as with many members of the Solanaceae family."
