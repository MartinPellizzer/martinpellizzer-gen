    "intro": "Sonchus oleraceus var. litoralis, commonly known as sea lettuce or coastal sowthistle, is a coastal plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its succulent, lobed leaves and yellow flowers. This variety thrives in saline and wet environments, often found along shorelines and in marshy areas. Its growth habit is prostrate, allowing it to spread across tidal zones and stabilize soil. The plant is edible and has been used in traditional cuisines, though it may cause mild gastrointestinal irritation in some individuals."
