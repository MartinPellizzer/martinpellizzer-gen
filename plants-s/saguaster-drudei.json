    "intro": "Saguaster drudei, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday. The plant has slender, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. Saguaster drudei belongs to the Convolvulaceae family, which includes other morning glory species. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions and it is often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds."
