    "intro": "Sempervivum marmoreum, commonly known as the stonecrop or hens and chicks, is a succulent plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, thick leaves that are often adorned with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ability to form offsets allows it to propagate easily, contributing to its hardiness and widespread cultivation."
