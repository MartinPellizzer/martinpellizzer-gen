    "intro": "Schizachyrium tenerum var. cirratum, commonly known as the curly feathery grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and tufted, fluffy seed heads that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, sandy soils, and disturbed areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the summer. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
