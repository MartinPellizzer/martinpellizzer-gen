    "intro": "Spondogona, commonly known as the \"butterfly orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. Spondogona species are characterized by their showy, butterfly-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. They typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks in their natural habitat. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
