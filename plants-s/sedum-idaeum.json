    "intro": "Sedum idaeum, commonly known as Idaeum stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink or purple. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its leaves are typically thick and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Sedum idaeum is also known for its resilience and ability to bloom throughout the summer months."
