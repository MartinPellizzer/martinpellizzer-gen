    "intro": "Sedum polyrhizum, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or white. The plant is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy species that thrives in well-drained soil. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, which helps it store water and survive in dry conditions. Sedum polyrhizum is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
