    "intro": "Selaginella pygmaea, commonly known as the lesser maidenhair fern, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and is often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized spore-producing structures. Its rhizomes are typically short and branched, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Selaginella pygmaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
