    "intro": "Salix nigricans var. borussica, commonly known as the black willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a valuable species for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
