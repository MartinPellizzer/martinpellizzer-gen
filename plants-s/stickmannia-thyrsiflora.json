It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has a woody stem with a thick, fibrous bark, and its leaves are small, oval, and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Stickmannia thyrsiflora is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
