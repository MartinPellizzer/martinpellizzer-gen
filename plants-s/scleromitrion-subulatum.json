    "intro": "Scleromitrion subulatum, commonly known as the slender spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. It is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves that form dense, low-growing mats. The plant belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae, which includes clubmosses and spikemosses. Its sporophytes are often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Scleromitrion subulatum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitat for small organisms in its native range."
