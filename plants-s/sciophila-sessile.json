    "intro": "Sciophila sessile, commonly known as the narrow-leaved shade plant, is a perennial herb native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It typically grows in forest understories where it thrives in low light conditions. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, hairy texture. Its small, white to pale pink flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, often in clusters at the base of the leaves. Sciophila sessile is valued for its ability to stabilize soil in shaded, wet areas and for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
