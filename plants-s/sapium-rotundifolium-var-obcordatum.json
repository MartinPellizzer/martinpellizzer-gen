    "intro": "Sapium rotundifolium var. obcordatum, commonly known as red swamp crayfish plant, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often red or purple in color, especially when grown in full sun. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive orange or red seed pods. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in moist, swampy environments and is commonly found in wetlands and along riverbanks."
