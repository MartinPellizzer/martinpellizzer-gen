    "intro": "Salix valdenitens, commonly known as the Valdeni willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and delicate, narrow leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often peeling in thin layers. Salix valdenitens is often found in moist, calcareous soils along riverbanks and in wetlands."
