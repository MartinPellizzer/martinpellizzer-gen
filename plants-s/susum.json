It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features serrated, hairy leaves and produces small yellow flowers that develop into hard, spiny seed pods. Susum is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Its latex contains compounds that have been historically used for their mild sedative properties."
