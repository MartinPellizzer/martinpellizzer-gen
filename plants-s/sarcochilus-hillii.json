    "intro": "Sarcochilus hillii, commonly known as the Hill's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive appearance, featuring broad, strap-like leaves and a single, showy white or pale green flower. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks rather than in soil, and relies on humid, shaded environments for survival. Its flowers are highly fragrant and attract specific pollinators, such as certain species of beetles. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sarcochilus hillii is considered a threatened species."
