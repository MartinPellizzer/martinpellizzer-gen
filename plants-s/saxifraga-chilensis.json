    "intro": "Saxifraga chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Chile. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often found in rocky or coastal habitats. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Saxifraga chilensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh coastal conditions."
