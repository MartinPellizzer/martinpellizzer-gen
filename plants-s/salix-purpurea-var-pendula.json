    "intro": "Salix purpurea var. pendula, commonly known as weeping willow, is a cultivar of the willow tree characterized by its cascading, drooping branches. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are bright green in summer and turn yellow in autumn. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. The weeping willow is often planted for its ornamental value and ability to provide shade along waterways."
