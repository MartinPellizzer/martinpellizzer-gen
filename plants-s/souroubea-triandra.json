    "intro": "Souroubea triandra, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and West Africa. It is characterized by its large, oblong leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree's wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in the timber industry. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
