    "intro": "Sapium biglandulosum var. oligoneurum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It features simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by orange to red drupes that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
