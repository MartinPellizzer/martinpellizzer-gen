    "intro": "Stimomphis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white, orchid-like flowers and its unique ability to grow without soil, relying instead on symbiotic relationships with specific fungi. The plant's roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the air and water, a trait known as epiphytism. Its leaves are thin and waxy, adapted to conserve moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Stimomphis is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
