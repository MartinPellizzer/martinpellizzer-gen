    "intro": "Sporobolus sanguineus, commonly known as bloodgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive red-tipped leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and disturbed areas. Its flowering spikes produce small, pale green to reddish spikelets, which are wind-dispersed. Bloodgrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
