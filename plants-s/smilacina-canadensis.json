    "intro": "Smilacina canadensis, commonly known as Canadian greenbriar, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a member of the Smilacaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and tendrils that aid in its growth along vegetation. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its woodland habitat. Smilacina canadensis is typically found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and stream banks."
