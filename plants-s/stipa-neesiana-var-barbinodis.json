    "intro": "Stipa neesiana var. barbinodis, commonly known as the barbed needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia, particularly China and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often adorned with bristly, barbed hairs. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and the plant typically grows in open, rocky or mountainous habitats. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique texture and form."
