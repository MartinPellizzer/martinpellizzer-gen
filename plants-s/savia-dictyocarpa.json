    "intro": "Savia dictyocarpa, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, making it a plant to handle with care. Savia dictyocarpa is adapted to survive in harsh environments, storing water in its thick stems and leaves."
