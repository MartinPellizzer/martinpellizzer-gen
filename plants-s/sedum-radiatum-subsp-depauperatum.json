    "intro": "Sedum radiatum subsp. depauperatum, commonly known as the sparse sedum, is a low-growing succulent native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted for water storage and reducing transpiration. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellowish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for landscaping in dry climates."
