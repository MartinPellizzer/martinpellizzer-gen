    "intro": "Seriphium distichum, commonly known as the two-rowed hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and branching. Seriphium distichum produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its role in pollinator habitats."
