It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats."
