    "intro": "Sturmia liliifolia, commonly known as the dwarf lily-of-the-valley, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often described as resembling lily leaves, hence its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
