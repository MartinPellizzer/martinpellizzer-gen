    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum var. versicolor, commonly known as the colorful potato, is a variant of the common potato that exhibits a wide range of flower colors, including purple, blue, and white. This plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its tuberous roots that are typically harvested for culinary use. The flowers are often more showy than those of the standard potato, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth. The plant is also valued for its genetic diversity, which can contribute to breeding programs aimed at improving potato varieties."
