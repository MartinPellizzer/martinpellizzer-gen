    "intro": "Soldanella minima f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved snowbell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are broader than the typical form of the species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its delicate appearance and early blooming habit make it a notable plant in alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
