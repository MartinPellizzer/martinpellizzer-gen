    "intro": "Senecio denticulatus var. depilis, commonly known as the smoothleaf groundsels, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving them a soft appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a dense cluster, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is a popular choice for container gardening."
