    "intro": "Saxifraga punctata, commonly known as the white saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It features small, white flowers with five petals and a distinctive red or pink calyx. The plant has a rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to retain moisture. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous and tundra environments. Saxifraga punctata is adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh conditions with minimal nutrients."
