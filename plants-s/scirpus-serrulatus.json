    "intro": "Scirpus serrulatus, commonly known as the sawleaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and have serrated edges, giving the plant its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense, cylindrical spikes, typically in late summer. This plant thrives in marshy areas and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
