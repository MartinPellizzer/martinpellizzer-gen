    "intro": "Strephonema tessmannii, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often accompanied by distinctive bracts. Its seeds are encased in a cotton-like fiber, which gives the plant its common name. Strephonema tessmannii is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in some areas."
