    "intro": "Spathodea platypoda, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a striking tropical tree native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy, fiery orange-red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The tree's rapid growth and ability to tolerate various soil types make it a popular choice in landscaping."
