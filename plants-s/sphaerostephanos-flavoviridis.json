    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos flavoviridis, commonly known as the yellow-flowered star-ivy, is a member of the Araliaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Sphaerostephanos flavoviridis is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
