    "intro": "Sphaerocionium scabrum, commonly known as the rough rock-rose, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, which is characterized by its succulent leaves and showy flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, often in clusters. Its leaves are thick and covered in a gritty texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Sphaerocionium scabrum is typically found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in regions with low rainfall."
