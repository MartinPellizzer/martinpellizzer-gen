    "intro": "Selaginella sanguinolenta f. kantzensis, commonly known as the red-stemmed spikemoss, is a rare and distinctive fern ally native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often display a reddish hue, particularly in younger growth. The plant produces small, spirally arranged leaves that are typically lanceolate in shape. Its reproductive structures, including microsporophylls and megasporophylls, are tightly packed in strobili, typical of the Selaginellaceae family. This fern ally thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats."
