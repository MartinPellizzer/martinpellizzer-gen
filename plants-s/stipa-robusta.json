    "intro": "Stipa robusta, commonly known as the robust needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Stipa robusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
