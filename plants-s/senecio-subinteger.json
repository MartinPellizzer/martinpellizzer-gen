It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered with fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
