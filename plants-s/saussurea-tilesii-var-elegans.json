It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features grayish-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish composite flowers in the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
