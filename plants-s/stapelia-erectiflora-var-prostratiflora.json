It is a succulent species characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and thick, waxy leaves. The plant produces striking, hooded flowers that are often yellow or orange in color, resembling the appearance of a corpse. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. This variety is known for its prostrate growth habit, spreading along the ground rather than growing upright."
