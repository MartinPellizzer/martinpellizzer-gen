    "intro": "Sisymbrium austriacum var. erysimifolium, commonly known as the Austrian broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other species. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often inconspicuous and arranged in clusters. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for several years. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants."
