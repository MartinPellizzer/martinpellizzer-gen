    "intro": "Stilpnophyllum revolutum, commonly known as the revolute stilpnophyllum, is a rare and specialized plant belonging to the family Stilpnophyllaceae. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, with leaves that are revolute, meaning they are rolled under at the edges. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in temperate forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a distinctive, fragrant aroma that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
