    "intro": "Specklinia psichion, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition, hence its common name. The plant lacks leaves and relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
