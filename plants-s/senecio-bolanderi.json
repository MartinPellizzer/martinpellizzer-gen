    "intro": "Senecio bolanderi, commonly known as Bolander's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant features narrow, hairy leaves and produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland mountain regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
