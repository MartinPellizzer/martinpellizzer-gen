    "intro": "Salix exigua var. sericans, commonly known as the silver willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, oval leaves that are often covered in a silvery or grayish pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is typically found in moist, well-drained soils near streams or in open woodlands. It has a shallow root system and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife. The leaves and branches are also used in traditional herbal remedies."
