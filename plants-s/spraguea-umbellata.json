    "intro": "Spraguea umbellata, commonly known as the umbrella fern, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and its distinctive, umbrella-like fronds that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in compact, umbrella-shaped clusters at the tips of its fronds. Spraguea umbellata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. Its growth habit and unique appearance make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
