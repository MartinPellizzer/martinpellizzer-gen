It features small, white flowers with five petals arranged in a star-like pattern, which is characteristic of its genus. The plant has opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, smooth seeds in a capsule. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, lawns, and along pathways. Stellaria media subsp. media is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas, making it both a weed and a wildflower."
