    "intro": "Schleichera trijuga var. extensa, commonly known as the broad-leafed sycamore, is a variant of the sycamore tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically broad and heart-shaped. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal. Its bark is often smooth and light gray, with a distinctive flaky texture. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic qualities."
