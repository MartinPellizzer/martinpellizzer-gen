    "intro": "Scutellaria lehmannii, commonly known as Lehmann's skullcap, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
