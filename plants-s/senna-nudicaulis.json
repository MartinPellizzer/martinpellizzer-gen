    "intro": "Senna nudicaulis, commonly known as the smallleaf senna, is a small, herbaceous shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It features slender, branching stems with opposite, narrow, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces bright yellow, papilionaceous flowers that are typical of the legume family, Fabaceae. Its small, pod-like fruits contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Senna nudicaulis is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems and a capacity for drought tolerance."
