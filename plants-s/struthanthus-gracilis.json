It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Struthanthus gracilis is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
