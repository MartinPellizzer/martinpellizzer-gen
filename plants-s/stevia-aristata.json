    "intro": "Stevia aristata, commonly known as mountain sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Stevia aristata is notable for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates."
