    "intro": "Silene eviscosa, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. Silene eviscosa is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in dry and sunny environments. It is a perennial herb that can grow up to 30 centimeters tall, and it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
