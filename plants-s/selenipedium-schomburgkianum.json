    "intro": "Selenipedium schomburgkianum, commonly known as the Schomburgk's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a lady's slipper, with a distinctive pouch-like structure that aids in pollination. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical features include long, strap-like leaves and a complex, spurred flower structure. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
