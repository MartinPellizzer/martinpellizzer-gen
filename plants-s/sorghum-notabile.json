It features wide, blade-like leaves and produces large, panicle-like flower heads that can be either green or red in color. The plant is well-adapted to arid environments and can thrive in poor soils. It is often cultivated for its grain, which is used in food and animal feed. Additionally, its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and garden use."
