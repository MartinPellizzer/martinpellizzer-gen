    "intro": "Sarcanthus flexus, commonly known as the flexible sarcanthus, is a unique plant species characterized by its distinctive spiral growth pattern. It belongs to the family Sarcanthaceae and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The plant features elongated, thin stems that exhibit a helical curvature, allowing it to twist around supporting structures. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often arranged in a spiral along the stem. Sarcanthus flexus is notable for its ability to adapt to shaded environments, making it a resilient species in forest undergrowth."
