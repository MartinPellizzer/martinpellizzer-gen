It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green bracts, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds. Senecio urbani is often found in urban areas, hence its common name, and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
