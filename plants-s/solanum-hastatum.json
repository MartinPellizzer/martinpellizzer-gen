    "intro": "Solanum hastatum, commonly known as the hairy nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into berries, which are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. Solanum hastatum is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is considered a weed in some regions due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
