    "intro": "Selaginella chingii, commonly known as the Chinese spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is native to China and is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves that form compact, moss-like clusters. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized water-storing cells. Selaginella chingii typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as microsporangia and megasporangia, are located on specialized leaves called sporophylls."
