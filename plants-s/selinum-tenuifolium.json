    "intro": "Selinum tenuifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved parsley, is a herbaceous plant native to the dry, rocky soils of the western United States and parts of Canada. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are finely divided and emit a mild, aromatic scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in umbels, a characteristic common among plants in the Apiaceae family. Its leaves are often used in culinary applications, though they are less commonly consumed than its relative, parsley. Botanically, it is valued for its adaptability to arid conditions and its role in supporting local pollinators."
