    "intro": "Sempervivum flagelliforme, commonly known as the football plant or hen and chicks, is a succulent species native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces long, trailing stems that bear clusters of small, star-shaped flowers, typically in shades of pink or red. It is well adapted to rocky and dry environments, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its resilience and low maintenance requirements make it a favored plant among gardeners in arid climates."
