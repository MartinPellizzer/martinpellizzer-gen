    "intro": "Stipa pulchra var. cernua, commonly known as the drooping feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and its distinctive, drooping inflorescence that resembles a plume of feathers. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its ornamental value is due to its elegant appearance and ability to withstand drought conditions. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife."
