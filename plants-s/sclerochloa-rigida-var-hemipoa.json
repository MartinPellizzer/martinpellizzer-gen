    "intro": "Sclerochloa rigida var. hemipoa, commonly known as the rigid hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and rigid, wiry stems that are often covered in fine, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky habitats. Its hardy nature makes it a resilient plant in arid and semi-arid environments."
