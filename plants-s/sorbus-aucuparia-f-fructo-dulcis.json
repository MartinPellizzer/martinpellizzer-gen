    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia f. fructo-dulcis, commonly known as the sweet-fruited rowan, is a botanical variant of the common rowan tree. It is characterized by its edible, sweet-tart berries, which are a notable departure from the typically bitter fruits of the standard species. The plant belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. Its foliage consists of alternate, pinnately compound leaves, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in spring. The sweet-fruited rowan is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of food for wildlife."
