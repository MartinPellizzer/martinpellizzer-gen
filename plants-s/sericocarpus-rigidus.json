    "intro": "Sericocarpus rigidus, commonly known as stiff burrplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, spiny fruits called achenes, which are covered in stiff, bristly hairs. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Sericocarpus rigidus is known for its low-growing, mat-forming structure and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
