    "intro": "Scolymus, commonly known as goat's beard, is a genus of flowering plants in the daisy family (Asteraceae). These plants are characterized by their distinctive, fern-like leaves and showy, yellow or orange flower heads that resemble a beard. Scolymus species are typically herbaceous perennials, often found in temperate regions of Europe and Asia. They thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making them suitable for rock gardens and borders. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to their ecological value."
