    "intro": "Schoenus stygius, commonly known as the swamp grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in South America. It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of lakes and rivers, thriving in saturated soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Schoenus stygius plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
