    "intro": "Salix arctica f. leiocarpa, commonly known as the Arctic willow, is a low-growing shrub native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, oval leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and its flowers are usually green or reddish in color. It thrives in harsh environments with limited nutrients and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. This subspecies is notable for its role in stabilizing soil in tundra ecosystems."
