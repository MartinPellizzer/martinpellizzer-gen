    "intro": "Salix pyrrha, commonly known as the Persian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and long, narrow leaves that are often silvery-white underneath. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as rivers and lakes. The bark of Salix pyrrha is smooth and grayish, with a fibrous texture that makes it somewhat durable."
