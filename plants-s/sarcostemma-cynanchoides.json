    "intro": "Sarcostemma cynanchoides, commonly known as the climbing milkweed or devil's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found growing on trees or shrubs, using its twining stems for support. The latex sap of this plant is milky and can be irritant, which is a common feature among plants in the Asclepiadaceae family."
