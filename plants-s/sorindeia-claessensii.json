    "intro": "Sorindeia claessensii, commonly known as the Malagasy orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a combination of white, yellow, and green hues. The plant grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its morphology includes a slender, erect stem with few leaves and a single, large floral spike. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Sorindeia claessensii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
