    "intro": "Spondias sinensis, commonly known as the red mango or Chinese tamarind, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into edible, red or orange fruits with a tangy flavor. The fruit is often used in traditional medicine and culinary applications due to its high vitamin C content and antioxidant properties. Its ornamental value also makes it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions."
