    "intro": "Syzygium gracilentum, commonly known as the white corymbia, is a tropical rainforest tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, edible seeds. Syzygium gracilentum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm climates for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
