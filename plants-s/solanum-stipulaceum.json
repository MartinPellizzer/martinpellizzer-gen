    "intro": "Solanum stipulaceum, commonly known as the stipulate nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
