    "intro": "Stichorkis chapaensis, commonly known as the Chapa's stichorkis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom during the early morning hours. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in shaded, moist environments within cloud forests. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this unique botanical species from further decline."
