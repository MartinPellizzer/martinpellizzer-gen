    "intro": "Scilla autumnalis var. gallica, commonly known as French scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It produces clusters of striking blue or violet flowers in the autumn, typically from September to November. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming habit, which adds color to gardens during the transition from summer to winter."
