It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, clustered leaves and produces delicate white or pinkish flowers in early spring. Its succulent stems and leaves help it retain moisture in dry conditions. This variety is characterized by its fragility, which is reflected in its common name and its tendency to break easily."
