It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It is often found in grasslands, deserts, and along roadsides. Sida lancea is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it a common weed in arid regions."
