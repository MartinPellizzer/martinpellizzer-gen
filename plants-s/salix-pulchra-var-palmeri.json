    "intro": "Salix pulchra var. palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's willow, is a rare and distinctive shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in wet meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species in ecological studies."
