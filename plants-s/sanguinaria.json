    "intro": "Sanguinaria, commonly known as bloodroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive red sap, which gives it its common name and has been used historically for medicinal purposes. The plant features a single, erect stem with a basal leaf that is palmately lobed. Its showy, white flowers bloom in early spring, followed by bright red berries that mature in the summer. Sanguinaria thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in shaded environments."
