    "intro": "Solidago sigmoidea, commonly known as the narrowleaf goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features erect, branching stems that are often reddish-brown in color. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and slightly hairy, with a prominent midvein. The showy yellow flowers appear in late summer to early autumn, forming dense, clustered inflorescences that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
