    "intro": "Stenandrium nanum, commonly known as the dwarf stenandrium, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens."
