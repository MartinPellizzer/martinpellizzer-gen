    "intro": "Solanum catanduvae, commonly known as the Catanduvae nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountain range in South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually violet or purple in color. Its fruits are berries that contain several seeds, and the plant is part of the nightshade family, Solanaceae. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
