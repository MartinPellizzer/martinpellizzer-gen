    "intro": "Sporobolus aculeatus, commonly known as prickly sacaton, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and sharp, spiny leaf blades that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Sporobolus aculeatus plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
