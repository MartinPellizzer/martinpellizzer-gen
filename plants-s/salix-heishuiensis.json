    "intro": "Salix heishuiensis, commonly known as the Heishui willow, is a species of willow native to China. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, temperate environments. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hair. Its catkin-like flowers appear in early spring, contributing to its role in pollination. The wood of Salix heishuiensis is lightweight and has been traditionally used in local crafts and construction."
