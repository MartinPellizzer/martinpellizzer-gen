    "intro": "Spergularia rupicola var. australis, commonly known as the coastal sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a low-growing herb with small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky coastal environments and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping it retain moisture in arid conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
