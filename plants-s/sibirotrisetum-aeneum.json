    "intro": "Sibirotrisetum aeneum, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which results from its fine, hair-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or tundra environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value and ecological resilience."
