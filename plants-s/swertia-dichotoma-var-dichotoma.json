    "intro": "Swertia dichotoma var. dichotoma, commonly known as the Himalayan gentian, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces bright blue or violet flowers in clustered inflorescences, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
