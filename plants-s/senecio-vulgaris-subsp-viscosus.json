    "intro": "Senecio vulgaris subsp. viscosus, commonly known as sticky groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, often sticky leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats. Its subspecies viscosus is distinguished by its more pronounced sticky secretions on the leaves compared to the typical form. The plant is also known for its ability to spread vegetatively through its rhizomes."
