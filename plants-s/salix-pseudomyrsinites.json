    "intro": "Salix pseudomyrsinites, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in cold, harsh environments. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and its leaves are typically narrow and hairy. It is often found in alpine meadows, rocky slopes, and tundra habitats. Due to its resilience, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
