    "intro": "Stefaninia, commonly known as the star-of-Bethlehem, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asparagaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Stefaninia mirabilis, which is native to southern Africa. The plants are characterized by their rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped white or pink flowers. They are often grown as ornamental plants due to their delicate appearance and ease of cultivation. Stefaninia species are typically drought-tolerant and thrive in well-drained soil."
