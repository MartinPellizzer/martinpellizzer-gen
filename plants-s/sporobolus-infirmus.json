    "intro": "Sporobolus infirmus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, thread-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense spikes. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as dunes and prairies. Sporobolus infirmus is drought-tolerant and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils through its extensive root system."
