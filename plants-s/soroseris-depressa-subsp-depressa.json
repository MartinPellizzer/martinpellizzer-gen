The plant features a short, creeping stem with opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in late spring to early summer. The species is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora in its native habitat."
