    "intro": "Strychnos alnifolia, commonly known as the African poisonwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical, glossy green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, elongated pods containing glossy black seeds. It is notable for containing toxic alkaloids, such as strychnine and brucine, which are present in its seeds and roots. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in traditional medicine and landscaping."
