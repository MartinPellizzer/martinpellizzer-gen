    "intro": "Stylisma pattersonii, commonly known as the Paterson's stylisma, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
