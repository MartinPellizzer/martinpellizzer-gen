It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its slender, cuneate leaves and small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its growth habit is prostrate, often forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in harsh conditions. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
