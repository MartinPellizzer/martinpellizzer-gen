    "intro": "Solanum abutiloides, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a shrub native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces berries that start green and mature to a deep blue or black, containing toxic alkaloids. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or mountainous areas. Due to its ornamental value and toxic properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires caution."
