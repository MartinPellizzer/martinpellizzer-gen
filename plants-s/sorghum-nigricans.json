    "intro": "Sorghum nigricans, commonly known as black sorghum, is a tall, robust grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark purple to black stems and leaves, which give it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains. It thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for its grain, which is used in food and animal feed. Due to its hardy nature, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens and landscapes."
