It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring slender, upright stems covered in small, sticky glands. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture, and it prefers well-drained soils in full sun. Spiesia pellita is often found in dry meadows and rocky areas, and it is considered a member of the Euphorbiaceae family."
