    "intro": "Salix rectijulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination and seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
