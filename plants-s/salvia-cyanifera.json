    "intro": "Salvia cyanifera, commonly known as blue sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flower spikes that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are opposite along the stems, and it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. Salvia cyanifera is drought-tolerant and often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements. It also attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native gardens."
