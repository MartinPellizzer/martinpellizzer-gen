It is characterized by its distinctive pinnately compound leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies."
