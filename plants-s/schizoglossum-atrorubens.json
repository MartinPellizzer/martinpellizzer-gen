    "intro": "Schizoglossum atrorubens, commonly known as the red-black orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its dark purple to black petals and sepals, which contrast sharply with its bright red lip. Native to the high-altitude regions of South America, this plant thrives in cool, humid environments. Its unique coloration and morphology make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
