    "intro": "Sarcochilus purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-stemmed sarcochilus, is a terrestrial orchid native to Australia. It features a short, thick rhizome with fleshy, strap-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale green to reddish-brown flowers with prominent sepals and petals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is typically found in forested areas. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
