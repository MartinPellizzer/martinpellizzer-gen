    "intro": "Schoenissa rosea, commonly known as the pink orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking pink or purple flowers, which bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. The botanical features of Schoenissa rosea make it a popular choice for both horticultural collections and botanical research."
