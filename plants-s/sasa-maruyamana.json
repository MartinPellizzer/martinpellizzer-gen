    "intro": "Sasa maruyamana, commonly known as the Japanese bamboo or mountain bamboo, is a perennial grass native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes form dense clumps, allowing it to spread vegetatively and create thickets. Sasa maruyamana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional Japanese landscaping."
