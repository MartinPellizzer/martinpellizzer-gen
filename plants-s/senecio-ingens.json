    "intro": "Senecio ingens, commonly known as giant senecio, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its towering height, often reaching up to 10 meters, and its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a rosette of large, fleshy, blue-green leaves at the base, which are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its stems are woody and branched, supporting the heavy inflorescence. Senecio ingens is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky outcrops and coastal areas."
