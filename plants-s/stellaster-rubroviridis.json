    "intro": "Stellaster rubroviridis, commonly known as the red-green starfish, is a species of echinoderm belonging to the family Asteriidae. It is characterized by its distinctive radial symmetry and a body covered in small, calcareous plates. The coloration of this species varies, with a striking contrast between its red and green hues, which may serve as a form of camouflage or warning to predators. It typically inhabits shallow coastal waters, where it feeds on algae and other small organisms. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to marine biologists and conservationists."
