It features fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
