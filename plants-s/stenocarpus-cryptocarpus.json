    "intro": "Stenocarpus cryptocarpus, commonly known as the broad-leafed hakea, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bottlebrush-like flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal heathlands and sclerophyllous forests, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers, which are usually pink or red, are pollinated by nectar-feeding birds and insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that opens to release seeds, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat."
