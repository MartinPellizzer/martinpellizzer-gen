    "intro": "Salix acuminata var. obovata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its distinctive, narrow, obovate leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found along riverbanks and in wetlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its ornamental value has also made it a popular choice for landscaping in certain regions."
