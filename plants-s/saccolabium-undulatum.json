    "intro": "Saccolabium undulatum, commonly known as the undulating saccolabium, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds. Saccolabium undulatum is often used in traditional medicine and for soil stabilization in degraded landscapes."
