    "intro": "Salvia calaminthifolia, commonly known as lemon mint or California sagebrush, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or blue, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Its aromatic foliage releases a minty scent when crushed, which is a characteristic feature of the Salvia genus. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats."
