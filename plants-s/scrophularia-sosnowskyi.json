    "intro": "Scrophularia sosnowskyi, commonly known as the Siberian figwort, is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of purple and pink, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments and requires specific soil conditions to survive. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
