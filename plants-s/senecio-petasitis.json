It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its fluffy, white, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has a rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. Senecio petasitis is an evergreen perennial that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
