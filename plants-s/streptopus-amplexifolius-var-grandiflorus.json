    "intro": "Streptopus amplexifolius var. grandiflorus, commonly known as the broad-leaved starwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It features a basal rosette of broad, wavy-edged leaves that clasp the stem, giving it its species name *amplexifolius*. The plant produces small, star-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a loose umbel. Its leaves are typically hairy and have a slightly bitter taste, which can deter herbivores. This variety is distinguished by its larger, more showy flowers compared to the typical form of *Streptopus amplexifolius*."
