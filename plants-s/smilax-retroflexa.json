    "intro": "Smilax retroflexa, commonly known as the red smilax, is a climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny stems, which help it to climb and protect itself from herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are typically arrow-shaped with a pointed tip and a rough texture. Smilax retroflexa is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
