It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant features woody stems with hairy foliage and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its berries are typically red or orange when ripe and contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to animals and humans. This species is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though with caution due to its toxic properties."
