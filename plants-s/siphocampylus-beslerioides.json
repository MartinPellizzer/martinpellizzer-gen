    "intro": "Siphocampylus beslerioides, commonly known as the Besleri's siphocampylus, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It is native to Central America and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbrella-shaped inflorescences, typical of the carrot family. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
