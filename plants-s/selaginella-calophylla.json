    "intro": "Selaginella calophylla, commonly known as the dwarf clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, scale-like leaves that form dense, cushion-like clusters. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Selaginella calophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
