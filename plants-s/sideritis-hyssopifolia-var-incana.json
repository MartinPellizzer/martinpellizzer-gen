It features slender, erect stems covered in dense white or grayish hairs, giving it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture. Sideritis species are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties."
