    "intro": "Solanum subenervium, commonly known as the African nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to various regions in Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often glandular and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Solanum subenervium belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other toxic plants, and it contains compounds that can be harmful if ingested. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided as a food source and is more commonly found in wild or cultivated settings as an ornamental or weed."
