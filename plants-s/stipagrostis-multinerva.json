    "intro": "Stipagrostis multinerva, commonly known as the many-nerved grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent venation pattern. The plant typically grows in open, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, and it is often found in grassland ecosystems. Stipagrostis multinerva plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
