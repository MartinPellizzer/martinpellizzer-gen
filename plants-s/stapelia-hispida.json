    "intro": "Stapelia hispida, commonly known as the hairy stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are small and often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Stapelia hispida is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established."
