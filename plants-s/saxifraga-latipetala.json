    "intro": "Saxifraga latipetala, commonly known as the broad-petaled saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers with five broad petals, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and have a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Saxifraga latipetala is often found in high-altitude environments where it adapts to cold and harsh conditions."
