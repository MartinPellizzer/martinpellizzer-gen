    "intro": "Sempervivum \u00d7 angustifolium, commonly known as the hen and chicks plant, is a hybrid succulent belonging to the Crassulaceae family. It is characterized by its rosette-forming foliage, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces offsets, or \"chicks,\" which grow around the base of the parent plant, creating dense clusters. Its leaves are typically blue-green or silver-gray, with a waxy coating that reduces water loss. Native to the mountainous regions of Europe, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
