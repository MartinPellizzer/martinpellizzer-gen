    "intro": "Scutellaria gardoquioides, commonly known as the Gardoqui's skullcap, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, arranged in whorls along the stem. It thrives in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
