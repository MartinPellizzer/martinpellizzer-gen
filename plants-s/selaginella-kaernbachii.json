    "intro": "Selaginella kaernbachii, commonly known as the Karner's spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. The plant has creeping stems that produce upright, cone-like structures called strobila, which bear the spores. Its leaves are linear and arranged spirally around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. Selaginella kaernbachii is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitats."
