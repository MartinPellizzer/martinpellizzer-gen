    "intro": "Stephanandra gracilis, commonly known as the slender stephanandra, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers in spring, followed by small, red berries in the autumn. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal flowering."
