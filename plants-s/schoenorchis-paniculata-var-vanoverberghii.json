    "intro": "Schoenorchis paniculata var. vanoverberghii, commonly known as the Vanoverbergh's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in the understorey of tropical rainforests. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, and it produces a single, branched inflorescence with numerous flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
