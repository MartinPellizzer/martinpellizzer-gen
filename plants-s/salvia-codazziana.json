    "intro": "Salvia codazziana, commonly known as the Codazzi sage, is a striking perennial plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of vibrant violet or blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are lance-shaped, often with a slightly fuzzy texture, and emit a strong, mint-like fragrance. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to well-drained soils. It thrives in full sun and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant."
