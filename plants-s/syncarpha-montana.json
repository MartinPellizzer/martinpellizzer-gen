    "intro": "Syncarpha montana, commonly known as the mountain synbranch, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It features a compact, low-growing structure with dense foliage and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid, mountainous habitat. It is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in rocky or well-drained soils. Syncarpha montana is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience."
