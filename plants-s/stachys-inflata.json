    "intro": "Stachys inflata, commonly known as the inflated hedge nettle, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated, bladder-like stems that store water, a feature that helps it survive in dry environments. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and has opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. Its small, pink or purple flowers appear in whorled clusters along the stems, and it blooms from late spring to early autumn. Stachys inflata is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
