    "intro": "Salvia persicifolia, commonly known as peachleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its attractive, lance-shaped leaves that resemble peach leaves, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of violet-blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Salvia persicifolia is also valued for its aromatic foliage and its role in attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
