It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to the genus Salacia. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
