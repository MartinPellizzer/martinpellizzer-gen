    "intro": "Stelis ancistra, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a slender, wiry stem with clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer. Its roots are often covered in a dense, white mycorrhizal sheath, which aids in nutrient absorption. Stelis ancistra is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
