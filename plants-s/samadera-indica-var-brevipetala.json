    "intro": "Samadera indica var. brevipetala, commonly known as the short-petaled Indian sandalwood, is a variant of the Indian sandalwood tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and is used in traditional medicine and incense. This variety is less common than the standard Samadera indica and is often found in specific regions of India."
