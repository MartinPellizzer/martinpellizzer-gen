    "intro": "Sarcomphalus domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands, particularly the Dominican Republic. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heliotropic flowers that open in the morning and close at dusk. The plant produces trumpet-shaped blooms in shades of pink to purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its vines can grow up to several meters in length, often climbing trees or shrubs in its natural habitat. The leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
