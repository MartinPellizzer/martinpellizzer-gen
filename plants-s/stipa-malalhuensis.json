    "intro": "Stipa malalhuensis, commonly known as the Malalhuense grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically pale green to golden in color. Stipa malalhuensis is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native range."
