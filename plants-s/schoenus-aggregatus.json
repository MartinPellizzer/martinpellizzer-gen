    "intro": "Schoenus aggregatus, commonly known as the clustered bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, forming dense clusters of grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish itself in muddy or marshy habitats. Schoenus aggregatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
