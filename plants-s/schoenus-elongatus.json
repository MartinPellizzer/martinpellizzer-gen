    "intro": "Schoenus elongatus, commonly known as the long-stemmed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often dark green in color. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a cylindrical cluster, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Schoenus elongatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing wetland soils."
