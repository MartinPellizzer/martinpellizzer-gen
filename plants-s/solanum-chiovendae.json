    "intro": "Solanum chiovendae, commonly known as the Chiovenda nightshade, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Its foliage consists of ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in high-altitude, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and unique characteristics, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
