    "intro": "Sida aequinoctialis, commonly known as the morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in a variety of colors, including blue, purple, and white. The plant is an annual herb that thrives in warm climates and is often found in disturbed soils. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, spiny capsule that aids in seed dispersal. Sida aequinoctialis is also known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction."
