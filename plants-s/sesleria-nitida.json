    "intro": "Sesleria nitida, commonly known as the silver grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Sesleria nitida is also valued for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
