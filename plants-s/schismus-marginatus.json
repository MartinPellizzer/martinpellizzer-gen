    "intro": "Schismus marginatus, commonly known as the desert spoon, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, showcasing a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that store water. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its unique leaf shape and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens. Schismus marginatus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
