It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, purple flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by yellow berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies."
