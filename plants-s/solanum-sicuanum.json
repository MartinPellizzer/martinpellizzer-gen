    "intro": "Solanum sicuanum, commonly known as the Sicilian nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, green berries that turn red when mature, which are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
