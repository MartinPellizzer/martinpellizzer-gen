    "intro": "Strychnos occidentalis, commonly known as the poisonwood tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa and the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces woody, capsule-like fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are a source of strychnine and brucine. Its bark and roots have been used traditionally in some cultures for medicinal purposes, though the plant is highly poisonous. The tree is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in a variety of soil types."
