    "intro": "Solidago \u00d7 bernardii, commonly known as the hybrid goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is a cross between Solidago canadensis and Solidago rugosa, resulting in a plant with distinctive foliage and floral characteristics. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, hairy textures, while the inflorescence consists of bright yellow, rayless flowers arranged in dense, cone-like clusters. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This plant plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the late summer and early fall."
