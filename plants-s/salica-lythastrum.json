It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in catkins, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its roots are extensive and can tolerate wet conditions, making it a common species in riparian zones. The wood is soft and lightweight, historically used for papermaking and construction."
