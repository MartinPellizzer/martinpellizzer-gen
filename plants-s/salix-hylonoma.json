    "intro": "Salix hylonoma, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in the spring, and its bark is smooth and grayish in color. It thrives in moist environments such as streambanks and wet meadows, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife. Salix hylonoma is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in riparian zones."
