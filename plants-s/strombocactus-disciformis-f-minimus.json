    "intro": "Strombocactus disciformis f. minimus, commonly known as the miniature disc cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a flattened, disc-like shape, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during the spring and summer months. Its foliage is covered in a layer of fine, white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in succulent gardens."
