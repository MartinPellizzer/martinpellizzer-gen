It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it forms dense stands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous structure that helps it thrive in waterlogged soils. Spodiopogon tohoensis is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
