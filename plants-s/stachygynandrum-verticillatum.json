    "intro": "Stachygynandrum verticillatum, commonly known as the spiral rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves around its stem, a feature that gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in clusters at the base of the plant. Stachygynandrum verticillatum is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appearance in aquatic gardens."
