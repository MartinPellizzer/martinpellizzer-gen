    "intro": "Symphionema paludosum, commonly known as the swamp fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in saturated soils and absorb nutrients. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, ovate leaflets that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces spores in small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of its fronds, which is characteristic of the fern family."
