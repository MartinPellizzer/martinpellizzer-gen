It belongs to the family Orphaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that are covered in a rough, textured surface, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are borne on erect, branching stems and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Scaphyglottis coriacea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions."
