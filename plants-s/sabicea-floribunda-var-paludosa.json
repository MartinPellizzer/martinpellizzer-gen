    "intro": "Sabicea floribunda var. paludosa, commonly known as the swamp sabicea, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in tropical regions. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in swampy or marshy areas. Due to its preference for wet environments, it plays an important ecological role in maintaining the biodiversity of its habitat."
