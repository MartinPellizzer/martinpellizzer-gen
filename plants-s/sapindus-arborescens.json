    "intro": "Sapindus arborescens, commonly known as the Chinese soapberry tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, spiny fruits that contain a starchy, soap-like pulp. The fruit is used in traditional medicine and as a natural soap substitute due to its saponin content. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
