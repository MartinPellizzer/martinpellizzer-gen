    "intro": "Sapindus manatensis, commonly known as the soapberry tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by spherical, spiny fruits containing a single seed. Its most notable botanical feature is the fruit's ability to produce a soapy lather when crushed, which has been traditionally used for cleaning purposes. The plant is also valued for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
