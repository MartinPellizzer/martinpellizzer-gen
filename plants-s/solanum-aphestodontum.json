    "intro": "Solanum aphestodontum, commonly known as the ghost pepper plant, is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America and is characterized by its small, yellowish-green fruits that mature to a bright red color. The plant produces a variety of alkaloids, some of which are responsible for its intense heat. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for its use in traditional medicine. However, due to its high capsaicin content, it requires careful handling and is not recommended for consumption by most people."
