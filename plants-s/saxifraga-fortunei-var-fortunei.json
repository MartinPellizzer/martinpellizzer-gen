    "intro": "Saxifraga fortunei var. fortunei, commonly known as the rockfoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers in early summer, which are borne on short stalks. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements."
