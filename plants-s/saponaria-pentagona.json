    "intro": "Saponaria pentagona, commonly known as the five-angled soapwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive pentagonal-shaped leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that is soapy to the touch, which is why it is related to the genus Saponaria. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This perennial herb is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in soap-making."
