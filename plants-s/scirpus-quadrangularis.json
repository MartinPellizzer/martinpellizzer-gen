    "intro": "Scirpus quadrangularis, commonly known as the square club-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Asia. It is characterized by its triangular or quadrangular stems, which are often ribbed and have a distinctive angular cross-section. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically borne in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems. Scirpus quadrangularis is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality in aquatic environments."
