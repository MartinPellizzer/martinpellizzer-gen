    "intro": "Shortia uniflora var. kantoensis, commonly known as the Kanto singleflower shortia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Japan. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are narrow and lanceolate, often with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
