    "intro": "Salvia cualensis var. perezii, commonly known as the Peruvian sage, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, which help it conserve moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is increasingly cultivated in regions with similar climatic conditions."
