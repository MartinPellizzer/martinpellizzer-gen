    "intro": "Salix pseudoernestii, commonly known as the Tibetan willow, is a shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and southwestern China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in cold, arid environments. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of willow species, and its leaves are usually narrow and deciduous. It has a shallow root system, allowing it to stabilize soil in rocky and mountainous regions. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value and ecological significance."
