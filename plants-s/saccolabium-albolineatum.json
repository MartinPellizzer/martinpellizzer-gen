    "intro": "Saccolabium albolineatum, commonly known as the white-lined ironwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Its fibrous roots help it survive in dry conditions, making it well adapted to harsh environments. The bark is thick and resistant, providing structural support and protection against herbivores."
