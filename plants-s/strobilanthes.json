    "intro": "Strobilanthes, commonly known as flame flower or whistling bird plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that often resemble flames or candles, which are highly attractive to pollinators. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. Strobilanthes species typically have opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produce small, tubular flowers in dense clusters. Many species are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their vibrant colors and unique floral structures."
