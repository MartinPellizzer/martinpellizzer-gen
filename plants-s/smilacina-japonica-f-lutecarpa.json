    "intro": "Smilacina japonica f. lutecarpa, commonly known as the Japanese Solomon's Seal var. Lutea, is a hybrid form of the Solomon's Seal plant. It is characterized by its striking yellowish-green foliage and its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is native to East Asia and thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
