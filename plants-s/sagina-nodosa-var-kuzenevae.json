    "intro": "[WRONG START] Sagina nodosa var. kuzenegae, commonly known as the Kuzenev's mossy weed, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the cold, alpine regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces tiny, pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring, typically in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas with high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native habitat."
