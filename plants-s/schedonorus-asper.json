    "intro": "Schedonorus asper, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its coarse, wiry stems and narrow, rough-textured leaves, which give it its common name. This plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. Schedonorus asper is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Its reproductive structures include spikelets that produce small, wind-dispersed seeds."
