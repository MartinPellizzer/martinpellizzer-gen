It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with a strong scent, which are often mistaken for insects due to their appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens. Its unique morphology and resilience make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
