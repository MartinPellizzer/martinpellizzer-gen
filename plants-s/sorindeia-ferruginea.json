    "intro": "Sorindeia ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty sorindeia, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a rusty-colored pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. These berries are an important food source for various bird species. Sorindeia ferruginea is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
