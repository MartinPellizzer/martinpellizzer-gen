    "intro": "Sapium carterianum, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, pinnately compound leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into orange-red, fleshy fruits. Its seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruits, contributing to its invasive spread in some regions. The tree is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its showy flowers and rapid growth."
