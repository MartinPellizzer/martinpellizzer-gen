    "intro": "Scilla pubescens, commonly known as the woolly scilla, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. Its bulbs are often used in rock gardens and as ornamental plants due to their early blooming habit. Scilla pubescens is also valued for its ability to naturalize and spread in suitable conditions."
