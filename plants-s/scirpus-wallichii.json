    "intro": "Scirpus wallichii, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often grow in wetland environments such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil, making it ecologically important in wetland ecosystems. Scirpus wallichii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
