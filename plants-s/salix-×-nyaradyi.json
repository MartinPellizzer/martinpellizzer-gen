    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 nyaradyi, commonly known as the Nyarady poplar, is a hybrid species within the willow family (Salicaceae). It is characterized by its slender, often weeping growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are male and female, contributing to its dioecious nature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and streams. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and parks for its graceful appearance."
