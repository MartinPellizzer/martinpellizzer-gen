    "intro": "Senegalia orientalis, commonly known as the mesquite tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 10 to 20 centimeters long and composed of multiple leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by long, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. Senegalia orientalis is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to access groundwater. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife and livestock."
