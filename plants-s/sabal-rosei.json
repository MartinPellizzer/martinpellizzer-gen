    "intro": "Sabal rosei, commonly known as the Florida rosewood, is a species of palm native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into dark blue or black berries. It thrives in wetland habitats and is often found in swamps and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
