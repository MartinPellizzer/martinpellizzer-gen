    "intro": "Solanum melongena subsp. agreste, commonly known as the wild eggplant, is a lesser-known subspecies of the eggplant native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its smaller, often more elongated fruits compared to the common eggplant, with a tougher skin and a more bitter taste. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with hairy stems and alternate leaves. It produces purple or white flowers and has a strong scent that attracts pollinators. Botanically, it is closely related to other members of the Solanaceae family, including tomatoes and peppers, and is valued for its potential in wild plant research and breeding programs."
