    "intro": "Saxifraga svetlanae, commonly known as the Svetlana saxifrage, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. It is typically found in alpine meadows and is often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair on its stems and leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
