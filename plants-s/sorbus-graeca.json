    "intro": "Sorbus graeca, commonly known as the Greek whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Balkans and parts of Turkey. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
