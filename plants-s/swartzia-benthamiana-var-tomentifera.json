    "intro": "Swartzia benthamiana var. tomentifera, commonly known as the woolly swartzia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rough, hairy bark and compound leaves with elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody, elongated pods containing flat, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry forest or scrubland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
