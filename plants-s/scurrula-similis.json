    "intro": "Scurrula similis, commonly known as the small purple false coral, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, which adheres tightly to the surfaces it colonizes, such as bark or stone. The thallus is typically pale yellow to orange in color, with a distinctive network of rhizines that anchor it to substrates. It lacks a distinct cortex and has a granular medulla, which contributes to its unique texture. This lichen is often found in temperate regions and is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
