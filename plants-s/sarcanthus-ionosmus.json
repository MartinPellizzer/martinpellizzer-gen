It features silvery-gray, fuzzy leaves that help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The silverleaf shrub is often used in ornamental gardening for its unique foliage and low maintenance requirements."
