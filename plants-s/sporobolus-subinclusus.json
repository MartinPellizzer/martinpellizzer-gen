    "intro": "Sporobolus subinclusus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
