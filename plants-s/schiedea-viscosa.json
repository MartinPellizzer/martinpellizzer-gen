    "intro": "Schiedea viscosa, commonly known as the sticky cushion plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Caryophyllaceae. It is native to the Hawaiian Islands and is typically found growing in moist, shaded areas on mountain slopes. The plant is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form composed of tightly packed, fleshy leaves. Its flowers are small, pink to red, and clustered in inflorescences, often blooming in late spring or early summer. Schiedea viscosa is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and invasive species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
