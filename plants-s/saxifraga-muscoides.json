    "intro": "Saxifraga muscoides, commonly known as the mossy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, cushion-like mats close to the ground, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs, providing protection from extreme weather conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, appearing in clusters and blooming in late summer. Saxifraga muscoides plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky and barren areas, contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat."
