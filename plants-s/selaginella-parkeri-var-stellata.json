    "intro": "Selaginella parkeri var. stellata, commonly known as the star sels, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces strobili, or cone-like structures, which contain the reproductive organs, including microsporangia and megasporangia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance."
