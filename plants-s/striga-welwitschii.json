    "intro": "Striga welwitschii, commonly known as the witchweed, is a parasitic plant native to sub-Saharan Africa. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and has a complex life cycle involving seed dormancy and germination triggered by chemical signals from host roots. It is a significant agricultural pest, particularly affecting crops like maize and sorghum. Its ability to cause severe yield losses has led to extensive research into control methods."
