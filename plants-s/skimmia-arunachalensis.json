    "intro": "Skimmia arunachalensis, commonly known as the Arunachal skimmia, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the family Pieraceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountain forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
