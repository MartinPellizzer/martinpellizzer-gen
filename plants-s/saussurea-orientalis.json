    "intro": "Saussurea orientalis, commonly known as the oriental saffron, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, showy yellow to orange flower heads. The plant produces numerous ray florets that surround a central disk of smaller, tubular flowers. Its fibrous roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The plant's resilience to cold and high-altitude conditions makes it a notable species in alpine ecosystems."
