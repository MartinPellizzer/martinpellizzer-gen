    "intro": "Saxifraga cespitosa subsp. monticola, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant forms dense cushions or mats, with small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, appearing in late summer and attracting pollinators such as bees. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh mountain environments, demonstrating resilience to wind, cold, and poor soil conditions."
