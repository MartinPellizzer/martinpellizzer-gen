    "intro": "Salicornia lagascae, commonly known as glasswort, is a halophytic plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean. It thrives in saline environments, such as salt marshes and tidal flats, due to its ability to tolerate high salt concentrations. The plant has prostrate or erect stems that are often covered in small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are small and greenish, typically appearing in clusters. Salicornia lagascae plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
