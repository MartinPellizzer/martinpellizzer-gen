    "intro": "Schoenodorus violaceus, commonly known as the violet-stemmed fern, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its striking violet-colored stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant."
