    "intro": "Stelis aperta, commonly known as the open-stem orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stem and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous regions. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to trees rather than growing in soil. Stelis aperta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its delicate floral display."
