    "intro": "Schoenoplectus \u00d7 kalmussii, commonly known as the hybrid bulrush, is a wetland plant native to North America. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Schoenoplectus acutus and Schoenoplectus pungens. This plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, forming dense stands that help stabilize shoreline ecosystems. Its tall, cylindrical stems are covered in small, scale-like leaves, and it produces spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Schoenoplectus \u00d7 kalmussii plays an important role in filtering water and providing habitat for aquatic wildlife."
