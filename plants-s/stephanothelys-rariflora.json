    "intro": "Stephanothelys rariflora, commonly known as the rare-flowered stephanothelys, is a unique member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish-white in color. The plant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
