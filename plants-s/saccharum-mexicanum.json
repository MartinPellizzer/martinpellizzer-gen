    "intro": "Saccharum mexicanum, commonly known as Mexican grass or sweetgrass, is a tall perennial grass native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, three-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Saccharum mexicanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in cultural and ceremonial practices."
