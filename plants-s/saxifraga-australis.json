    "intro": "Saxifraga australis, commonly known as the New Zealand saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand. It typically thrives in rocky or gravelly habitats, often found in alpine or subalpine regions. The plant features small, clustered leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Its flowers are pink or white, with five petals and are typically produced in early spring. Saxifraga australis is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature."
