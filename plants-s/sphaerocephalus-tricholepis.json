    "intro": "Sphaerocephalus tricholepis, commonly known as the woolly-headed orchid, is a flowering plant native to the wet tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rounded inflorescence and dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, often arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
