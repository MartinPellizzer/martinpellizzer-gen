    "intro": "Strangea steedmanii, commonly known as the Stewart's strangea, is a rare and unique plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
