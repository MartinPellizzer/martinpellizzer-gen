    "intro": "Spiraea ulmaria concolor, commonly known as white meadow spiraea, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist meadows and along stream banks. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge, and they turn yellow in the fall. Spiraea ulmaria concolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
