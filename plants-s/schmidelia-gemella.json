    "intro": "Schmidelia gemella, commonly known as the dwarf ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its dark, glossy leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Schmidelia gemella is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Its slow growth and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscaping."
