    "intro": "Salix semihelix, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Salix semihelix is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
