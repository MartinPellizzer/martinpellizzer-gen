    "intro": "Salsola foetida var. scopiformis, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub that thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in desert and steppe environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually fleshy and succulent, adapted to conserve water in harsh conditions. The species is notable for its ability to stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion in its native habitat."
