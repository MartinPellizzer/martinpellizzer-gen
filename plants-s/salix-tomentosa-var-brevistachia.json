    "intro": "Salix tomentosa var. brevistachia, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a shrub-like species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, soft, grayish-white pubescence covering the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, riverbanks, and wetlands. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
