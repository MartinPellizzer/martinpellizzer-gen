    "intro": "Syzygium kashotoense, commonly known as the Kashoto apple. It is a small evergreen tree native to the island of Madagascar, characterized by its smooth, dark bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, red, apple-like fruits. Syzygium kashotoense thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
