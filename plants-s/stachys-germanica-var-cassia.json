    "intro": "Stachys germanica var. cassia, commonly known as German violet or violet wood, is a perennial herb native to central and eastern Europe. It features upright, branching stems covered in dense, soft, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers arranged in whorls along the stems, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with hairy surfaces and a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats."
