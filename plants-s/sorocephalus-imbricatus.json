    "intro": "Sorocephalus imbricatus, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and features a dense cluster of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in dry conditions, and its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Sorocephalus imbricatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
