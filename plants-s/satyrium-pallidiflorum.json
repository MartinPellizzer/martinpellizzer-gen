    "intro": "Satyrium pallidiflorum, commonly known as the pale-flowered twayblade, is a small orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with pale green leaves. The plant produces delicate, pale yellow to greenish flowers that are often clustered in pairs. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
