It is a small, herbaceous annual or biennial plant that thrives in saline and sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are usually succulent to store water.

It is adapted to high salinity and extreme temperatures, making it an important species in desert ecosystems."
