    "intro": "Styphelia straminea, commonly known as the golden moorgrass, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of New Zealand. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, grass-like leaves that form a dense mat. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. Styphelia straminea thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in heathland and coastal dune environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for native insects and birds."
