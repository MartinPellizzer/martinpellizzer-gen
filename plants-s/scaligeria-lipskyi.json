    "intro": "Scaligeria lipskyi, commonly known as the Lipseki scaleria, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Scaligeria lipskyi is considered a species of conservation concern."
