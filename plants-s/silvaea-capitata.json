    "intro": "Silvaea capitata, commonly known as the clustered wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with trifoliate leaves that are heart-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a dense, rounded cluster at the end of each stem. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Silvaea capitata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
