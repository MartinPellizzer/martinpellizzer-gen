    "intro": "Sorbus splendens, commonly known as the golden-splendour whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that appear in late spring. The tree produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the autumn. Sorbus splendens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
