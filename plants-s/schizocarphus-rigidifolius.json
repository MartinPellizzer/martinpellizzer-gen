    "intro": "Schizocarphus rigidifolius, commonly known as the rigid-leaved schizocarph, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, also known as the carrot or parsley family, which is characterized by its umbellate inflorescences. The plant has compound, stiff, and often aromatic leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. Its flowers are small and white, clustered in umbrella-like clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. This species is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
