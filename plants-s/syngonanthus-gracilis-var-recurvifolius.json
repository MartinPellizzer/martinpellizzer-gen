It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its reproductive structures are adapted for water dispersal, facilitating propagation in aquatic habitats. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting aquatic biodiversity."
