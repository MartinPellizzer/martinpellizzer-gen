    "intro": "Stenogastra \u00d7 multiflora, commonly known as the hybrid boxwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, glossy foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate pruning. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature."
