    "intro": "Sphaeromariscus, commonly known as the globular sea hare, is a genus of marine gastropod mollusks belonging to the family Aplysiidae. These organisms are characterized by their soft, gelatinous bodies and lack of a true shell, instead possessing a thin, membranous covering. They are typically found in shallow coastal waters and are known for their vibrant colors and intricate patterns. Sphaeromariscus species are herbivorous, feeding primarily on algae and other plant matter. Their reproductive strategies often involve external fertilization, with eggs laid in gelatinous masses that float near the surface."
