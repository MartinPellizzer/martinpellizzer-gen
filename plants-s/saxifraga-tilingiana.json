    "intro": "Saxifraga tilingiana, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, often pale green or reddish leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Saxifraga tilingiana is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes, where it contributes to the unique biodiversity of these ecosystems."
