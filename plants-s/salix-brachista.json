    "intro": "Salix brachista, commonly known as the shortstem willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in streamside habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
