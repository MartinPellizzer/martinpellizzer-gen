    "intro": "Sticherus oceanicus, commonly known as the sea sticheras, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, tolerating salt spray and wind. Its small white or yellow flowers bloom in umbels, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its coastal habitat, it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local ecosystems."
