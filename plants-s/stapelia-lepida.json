    "intro": "Stapelia lepida, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, waxy, and often purple or greenish flowers that resemble a corpse, hence its common name. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its flowers typically open in the evening and emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators like flies. Stapelia lepida is a popular choice for succulent collectors due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
