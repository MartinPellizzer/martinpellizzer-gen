    "intro": "Saxifraga hypnoides var. lusitanica, commonly known as the Lusitanian saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe, particularly Portugal and Spain. It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, thriving in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features small, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in its natural habitat. Saxifraga hypnoides var. lusitanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
