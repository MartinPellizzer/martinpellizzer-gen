    "intro": "Silene heterodonta var. cossoniana, commonly known as the Cosson's catchfly, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Silene heterodonta var. cossoniana is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
