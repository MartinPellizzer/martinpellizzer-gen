    "intro": "Swartzia ulei, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and Southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant has compound leaves with oval to lance-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Swartzia ulei is often found in moist, well-drained soils in lowland to montane forests. Due to its slow growth and high commercial value, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
