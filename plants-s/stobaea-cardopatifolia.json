    "intro": "Stobaea cardopatifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed stobaea, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting various pollinators. Its growth habit is predominantly herbaceous, with a short, sturdy stem that supports its foliage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
