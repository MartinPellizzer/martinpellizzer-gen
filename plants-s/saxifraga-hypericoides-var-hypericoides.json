    "intro": "Saxifraga hypericoides var. hypericoides, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, helping to reduce water loss. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging habitats."
