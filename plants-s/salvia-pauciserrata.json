    "intro": "Salvia pauciserrata, commonly known as the narrow-toothed sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves with few, shallow teeth. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is increasingly cultivated in arid landscapes."
