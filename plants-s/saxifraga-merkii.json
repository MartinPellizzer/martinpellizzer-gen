    "intro": "Saxifraga merkii, commonly known as the Merk's saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant features small, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces clusters of delicate, white or pale pink flowers. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often found in high-altitude meadows. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Saxifraga merkii is considered a rare and specialized species."
