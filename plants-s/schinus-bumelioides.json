    "intro": "Schinus bumelioides, commonly known as the Mexican peppertree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often arranged in whorls, and its small, clustered flowers that range from white to pink. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but can be toxic to humans. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
