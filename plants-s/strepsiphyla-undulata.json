    "intro": "Strepsiphyla undulata, commonly known as the wavy leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, undulating leaves and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant prefers humid, shaded environments and is often found growing in forest understories. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to tree trunks without parasitizing them. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
