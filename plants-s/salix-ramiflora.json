    "intro": "Salix ramiflora, commonly known as the ramiflorous willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and small, clustered leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
