    "intro": "Salix berberifolia subsp. vyshinii, commonly known as the Vyshin's willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hair. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation projects."
