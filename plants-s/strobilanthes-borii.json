    "intro": "Strobilanthes borii, commonly known as the Bornean flame flower, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, vibrant orange-red bracts that resemble flowers. The plant typically grows as an erect herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its unique floral structure consists of showy bracts that enclose small, inconspicuous flowers, which are pollinated by insects. Strobilanthes borii is also notable for its seasonal blooming pattern, often flowering during the rainy season."
