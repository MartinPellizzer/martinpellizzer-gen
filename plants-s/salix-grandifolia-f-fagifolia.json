    "intro": "Salix grandifolia f. fagifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf willow, is a variant of the broadleaf willow species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside, giving it a distinct appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as riverbanks and wetlands. Its catkins are a notable feature, with male and female flowers arranged separately on the same plant. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil along waterways."
