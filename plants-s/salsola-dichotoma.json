    "intro": "Salsola dichotoma, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing annual or biennial species that thrives in sandy and saline soils. The plant produces small, green to yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually small, fleshy, and succulent, adapted to conserve water. Salsola dichotoma plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or barren environments."
