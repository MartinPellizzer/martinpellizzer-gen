    "intro": "Solanum cechicum, commonly known as the Cech's nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of violet or purple flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
