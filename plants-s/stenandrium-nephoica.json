    "intro": "Stenandrium nephoica, commonly known as the cloud mist orchid, is a rare and ethereal plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and striking, orchid-like flowers that bloom in a spectrum of soft pastel colors. The plant thrives in humid, misty environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces in cloud forests. Its unique adaptations allow it to absorb moisture from the air, making it highly dependent on consistent humidity levels. Due to its fragility and specific habitat requirements, Stenandrium nephoica is considered a conservation concern."
