    "intro": "Saxifraga valdensis, commonly known as the Valdenses saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in mountainous areas with cool, moist conditions. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Saxifraga valdensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to colonize difficult terrain."
