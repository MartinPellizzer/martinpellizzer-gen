    "intro": "Symplocos stocksii, commonly known as the whitebeard alder, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces white, bell-shaped flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by small, leathery berries in the fall. Symplocos stocksii thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and streamside habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of understory vegetation in eastern North American forests."
