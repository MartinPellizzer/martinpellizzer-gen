    "intro": "Salix caprea var. dentata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and lance-shaped leaves with finely serrated margins. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in woodland edges. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
