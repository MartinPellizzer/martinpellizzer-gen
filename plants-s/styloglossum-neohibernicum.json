    "intro": "Styloglossum neohibernicum, commonly known as the Irish tongue plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its slender, leafless stems that bear small, umbellate inflorescences with white to pale yellow flowers. Its unique morphology, including a long, slender stem and reduced leaves, suggests adaptations to specific ecological niches. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
