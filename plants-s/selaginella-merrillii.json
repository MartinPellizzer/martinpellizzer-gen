    "intro": "Selaginella merrillii, commonly known as the Chinese clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and distinctive, club-shaped sporophylls that bear spores. Native to China, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are typically linear to lanceolate, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Selaginella merrillii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
