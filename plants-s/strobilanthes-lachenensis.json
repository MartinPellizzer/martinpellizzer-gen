    "intro": "Strobilanthes lachenensis, commonly known as the Lachen's flame-of-the-forest, is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking orange-red bracts that resemble flames. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves during the dry season to conserve water. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in dense undergrowth of tropical forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
