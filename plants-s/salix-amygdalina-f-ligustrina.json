    "intro": "Salix amygdalina f. ligustrina, commonly known as the white willow, is a variant of the weeping willow species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, long, drooping branches that create a graceful, cascading appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a silvery-white underside that gives the plant its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and ponds."
