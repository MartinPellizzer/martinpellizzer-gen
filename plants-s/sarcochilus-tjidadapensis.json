    "intro": "Sarcochilus tjidadapensis, commonly known as the Tjidadap saxifrage, is a rare and unique orchid native to the rainforests of New Guinea. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, fleshy, greenish-brown pseudobulbs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, typically during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
