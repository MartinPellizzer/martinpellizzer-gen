    "intro": "Sesbania marginata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sesbania, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves with slender, elongated leaflets and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Sesbania marginata is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which makes it useful in soil enrichment and agroforestry systems."
