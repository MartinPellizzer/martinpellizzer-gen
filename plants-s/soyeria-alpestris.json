    "intro": "Soyeria alpestris, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes where temperatures are cooler. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Soyeria alpestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
