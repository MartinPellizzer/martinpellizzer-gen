    "intro": "Salix microdentata, commonly known as the narrow-toothed willow, is a species of flowering plant in the willow family, Salicaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tajikistan. This shrub typically grows in alpine or subalpine environments, often at elevations above 2,000 meters. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and small, narrow leaves with finely serrated margins. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
