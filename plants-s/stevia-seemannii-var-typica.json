    "intro": "Stevia seemannii var. typica, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are rich in steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and full sunlight. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in clusters and are followed by small, berry-like fruits. Stevia seemannii var. typica is widely cultivated for its intense sweetness and is used in herbal teas and as a sugar substitute."
