    "intro": "Stelis pastoensis, commonly known as the Pasto orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly found in Colombia and Ecuador. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale green, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good air circulation. Stelis pastoensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
