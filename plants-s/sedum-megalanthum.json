    "intro": "Sedum megalanthum, commonly known as the giant stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer, adding vibrant color to its habitat. Its stem is typically upright and branched, with a grayish-green hue. Sedum megalanthum is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
