    "intro": "Stapelia macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant star stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces large, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, often with a strong scent to attract pollinators. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is a popular choice for collectors due to its unique appearance. Stapelia macrocarpa is relatively easy to care for, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil."
