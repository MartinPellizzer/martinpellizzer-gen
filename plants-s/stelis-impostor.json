    "intro": "[WRONG START] Steles impostor, commonly known as the false orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and elegant, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow blossoms that bloom sequentially throughout the year. Stelis impostor thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its pseudobulbs and strap-like leaves are adaptations that help it store water and nutrients in its natural habitat."
