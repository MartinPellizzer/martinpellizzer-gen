    "intro": "Serapias aphylla, commonly known as the leafless orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its fleshy, green stems. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, it thrives in rocky and limestone soils. The plant produces vivid yellow or orange flowers with intricate patterns, often resembling other orchid species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
