    "intro": "Streblosa urticina var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth nettle, is a variant of the common nettle characterized by its reduced pubescence. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. Its stems are often covered in fine hairs, though this feature is less pronounced in the glabrescens variety. The plant is known for its stinging hairs, which can cause irritation upon contact with the skin."
