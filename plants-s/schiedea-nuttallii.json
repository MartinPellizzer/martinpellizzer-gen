    "intro": "Schiedea nuttallii, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 silversword, is a striking plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, fleshy leaves. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears a cluster of yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Schiedea nuttallii thrives in the high-elevation volcanic soils of Haleakal\u0101 National Park, where it is adapted to harsh, sunny conditions. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered an endangered species."
