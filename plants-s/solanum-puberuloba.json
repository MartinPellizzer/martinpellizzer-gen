    "intro": "Solanum puberuloba, commonly known as the pubescent nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of Africa and is characterized by its hairy, pubescent leaves and stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into berries, which are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. Solanum puberuloba is often found in woodland and shrubland habitats, growing in regions with a warm, humid climate. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by livestock and humans alike."
