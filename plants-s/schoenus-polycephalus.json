    "intro": "Schoenus polycephalus, commonly known as the many-headed sedge, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces clusters of small, three-lobed flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate water conditions."
