It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. It produces slender, elongated pods that contain seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. The species is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
