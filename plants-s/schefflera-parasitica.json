    "intro": "Schefflera parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic schefflera, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it can photosynthesize but also derives nutrients from its host plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or on the trunks of other trees, forming dense clusters. Its leaves are usually palmately compound, with multiple leaflets radiating from a central point. While it is not widely cultivated as an ornamental plant, it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats."
