    "intro": "Santolina anthemoides, commonly known as Spanish santolina, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, gray-green foliage with a distinctive aromatic scent, and its small, yellow flowers appear in early summer. The plant is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and drought tolerance, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, and is often used as a decorative ground cover. Santolina anthemoides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract beneficial insects."
