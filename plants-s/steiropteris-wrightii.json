    "intro": "Steiropteris wrightii, commonly known as Wright's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its reproductive structures, known as spore-bearing cones, are located at the base of the fronds. Steiropteris wrightii plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various organisms."
