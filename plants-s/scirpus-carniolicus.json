    "intro": "Scirpus carniolicus, commonly known as the Carpathian bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family. This plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. Scirpus carniolicus has tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine, thread-like hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are typically green to brown in color, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
