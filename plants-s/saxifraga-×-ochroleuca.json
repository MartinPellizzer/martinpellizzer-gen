    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 ochroleuca, commonly known as the white saxifrage, is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are often borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with high altitude conditions."
