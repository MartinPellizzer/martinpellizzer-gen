    "intro": "Silene alpinoprostrata, commonly known as the alpine prostrate campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms a dense mat of foliage, with small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and fleshy, helping it retain moisture in harsh conditions. Silene alpinoprostrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
