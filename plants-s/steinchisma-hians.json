    "intro": "[WRONG START] Stenchisma hians, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking, translucent, waxy leaves that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
