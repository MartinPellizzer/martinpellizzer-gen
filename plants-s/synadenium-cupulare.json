    "intro": "Synadenium cupulare, commonly known as the hooded milkweed, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive hooded calyx that encloses the flower. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Synadenium cupulare is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and botanical collections."
