    "intro": "Syngonanthus quadrangularis, commonly known as the four-angled balsam, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its square-shaped stems, which give it its scientific name, and its clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or biennial herb, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The flowers are usually pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
