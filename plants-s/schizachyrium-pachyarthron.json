    "intro": "Schizachyrium pachyarthron, commonly known as stiff false panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright, clump-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, spikelet-like flowers, which are often pale green to brown in color. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is commonly found in moist to wet soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Schizachyrium pachyarthron is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
