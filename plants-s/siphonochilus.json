    "intro": "Siphonochilus, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, feathery fronds that often float on the surface of water or grow submerged. They are typically found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and wetlands across tropical and subtropical regions. Siphonochilus species have rhizomes that help anchor them in aquatic environments and facilitate nutrient absorption. Their reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to their unique botanical appearance."
