    "intro": "Sida obsita, commonly known as desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant that typically grows in dry, rocky soils. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Sida obsita is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
