It features aromatic, gray-green leaves with a narrow, lance-shaped form, and its flowers are typically violet to purple in color. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens. Salvia atriplicifolia is also noted for its medicinal properties, though it is primarily cultivated for horticultural purposes."
