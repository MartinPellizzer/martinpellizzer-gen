    "intro": "Sambucus orbiculata var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, light green stems and heart-shaped leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic seeds and should be consumed with caution. The plant is often found in moist woodlands and is valued for its ornamental features and ecological benefits."
