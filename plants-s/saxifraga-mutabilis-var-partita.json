    "intro": "Saxifraga mutabilis var. partita, commonly known as the variegated stonecrop, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and fleshy, silver-green leaves with striking white and green variegation. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom reliably in cooler climates."
