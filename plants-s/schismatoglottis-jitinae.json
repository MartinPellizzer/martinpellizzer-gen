    "intro": "Schismatoglottis jitinae, commonly known as the Jitinae arrowleaf, is a rare and unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, specifically found in the Philippines. This plant is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
