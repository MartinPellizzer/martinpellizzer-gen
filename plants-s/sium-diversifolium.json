    "intro": "Sium diversifolium, commonly known as water parsnip, is a herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, and it produces an edible, though often bitter, root. Sium diversifolium plays a role in supporting local biodiversity and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
