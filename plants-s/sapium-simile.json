    "intro": "Sapium simile, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers followed by orange-red\u84b4\u679c that split open to release seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value but can become invasive in some regions. The sap of the plant contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans."
