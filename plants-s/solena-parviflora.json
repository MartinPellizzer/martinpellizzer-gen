    "intro": "Solena parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered solena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features slender stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Solena parviflora is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along riverbanks."
