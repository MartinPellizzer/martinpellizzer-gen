    "intro": "Succisa albescens, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Succisa albescens is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping."
