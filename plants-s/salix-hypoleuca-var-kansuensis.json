    "intro": "Salix hypoleuca var. kansuensis, commonly known as the Kansu willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and lance-shaped leaves that are typically silver-white underneath. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in river valleys and along streambanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in its native habitat."
