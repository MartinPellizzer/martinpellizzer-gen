    "intro": "Salix frayi, commonly known as the Fray's willow, is a species of flowering plant in the willow family, Salicaceae. It is native to the western United States, particularly found in arid and semi-arid regions. This shrub or small tree has slender, flexible branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often gray-green in color. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, woody fruits. Salix frayi is adapted to dry conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
