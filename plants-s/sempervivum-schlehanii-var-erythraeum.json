    "intro": "Sempervivum schlehanii var. erythraeum, commonly known as the Alpina rose, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features compact rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically green with red or purple hues on the edges. The plant produces tall, flowering stalks that bear small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or red. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, long-lived clumps over time."
