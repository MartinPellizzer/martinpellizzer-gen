    "intro": "Scirpus inundatus var. major, commonly known as the greater bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological role in water filtration and habitat provision. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming extensive colonies in wetland environments. Scirpus inundatus var. major is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
