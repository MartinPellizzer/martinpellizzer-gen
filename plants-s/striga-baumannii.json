    "intro": "Striga baumannii, commonly known as witchweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, attaching itself via haustoria to the roots of its host. This species is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is known for its rapid growth and ability to cause significant yield losses in crops like millet and sorghum. Its life cycle involves producing copious amounts of seeds, which can remain viable in the soil for many years. Due to its parasitic nature and impact on agriculture, Striga baumannii is a major concern for farmers in affected regions."
