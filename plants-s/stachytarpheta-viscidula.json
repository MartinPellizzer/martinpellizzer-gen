It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, sticky hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, arranged in terminal clusters. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along stream banks. Stachytarpheta viscidula is valued in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
