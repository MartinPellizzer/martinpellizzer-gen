    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum var. multijugum, commonly known as the multijugum potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato. It is characterized by its unique leaf structure, featuring multiple lobes or jugum, which distinguishes it from typical potato varieties. This plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is native to the Andes region of South America. It produces tubers that are often smaller and more flavorful than those of the standard potato. The variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its genetic diversity and potential for culinary use."
