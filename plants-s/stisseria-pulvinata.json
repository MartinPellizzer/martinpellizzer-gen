    "intro": "Stisseria pulvinata, commonly known as the purple-veined orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking violet and white flowers, which bloom during the cooler months. The plant has a delicate, herbaceous stem that often curls at the base, a feature that aids in its survival in harsh environments. Its leaves are elongated and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss. Botanically, it is notable for its unique floral structure and its role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
