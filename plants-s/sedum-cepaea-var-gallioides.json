    "intro": "Sedum cepaea var. gallioides, commonly known as the yellow stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture, making it well adapted to rocky and dry environments. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found growing on cliffs, walls, and in rocky crevices. Its compact growth habit and vibrant flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
