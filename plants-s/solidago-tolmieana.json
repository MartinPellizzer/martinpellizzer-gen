    "intro": "Solidago tolmieana, commonly known as Tolmie's goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Tolmie's goldenrod plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the fall season."
