    "intro": "Salix aquatica var. acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to wetland and riparian habitats. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 2-5 cm in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollination, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist to aquatic environments, often found along riverbanks and pond edges. Due to its adaptability and ecological importance, it plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
