    "intro": "Stipa pogonathera, commonly known as the hairy beardgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and distinctive, hairy inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of florets. Stipa pogonathera is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and ecological landscapes."
