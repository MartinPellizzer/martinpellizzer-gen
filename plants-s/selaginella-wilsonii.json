    "intro": "Selaginella wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its creeping stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Selaginella wilsonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions."
