    "intro": "Styloncerus microcephalus, commonly known as the small-headed styloncerus, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Stylonuridae. It is characterized by its small, elongated body and distinctive head structure, which is proportionally smaller than the rest of its body. This species is typically found in moist, forested environments where it feeds on decaying plant matter. Its life cycle involves a larval stage that plays a role in decomposing organic material, contributing to nutrient cycling in the ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and specialized beetle."
