    "intro": "Sporobolus gaditanus, commonly known as the Spanish needle or goatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces distinctive, bristly seed heads that are easily dispersed by wind. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. Its flowering occurs in summer, and it is adapted to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. Sporobolus gaditanus is an important plant in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
