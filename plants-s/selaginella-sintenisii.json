    "intro": "Selaginella sintenisii, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. This plant is notable for its ability to survive extreme desiccation, losing up to 95% of its water content and appearing dead, only to revive when rehydrated. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a unique, compact appearance. The plant reproduces via spores and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its resilience, it is often used in horticulture as an ornamental plant."
