    "intro": "Salvia glutinosa, commonly known as sticky sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky resin, which gives the plant its common name. The plant produces spikes of violet to purple flowers during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping. The sticky resin has been used historically in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
