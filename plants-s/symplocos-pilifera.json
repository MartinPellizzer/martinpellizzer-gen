    "intro": "Symplocos pilifera, commonly known as the hairy wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some bird species. Symplocos pilifera thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in gardens and landscapes."
