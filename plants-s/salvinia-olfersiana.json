    "intro": "Salvinia olfersiana, commonly known as water mallow, is a floating aquatic fern native to tropical regions. It has small, opposite leaves that are often covered with fine hairs, and it produces tiny, yellowish flowers. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats on the water surface. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native species and alter aquatic ecosystems."
