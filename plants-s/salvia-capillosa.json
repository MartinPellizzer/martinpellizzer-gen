    "intro": "Salvia capillosa, commonly known as the silky sage, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It features slender, upright stems covered in soft, silver-gray hairs, giving it a distinctive, silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and also covered in fine, silky hairs. Salvia capillosa is often grown as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and drought tolerance."
