    "intro": "Senecio hispidulus var. dissectus, commonly known as the dissected groundsel, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with silver-gray, woolly leaves that are deeply lobed and often dissected. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
