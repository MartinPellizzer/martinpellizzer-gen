    "intro": "Saxifraga lingulata proles cochlearis, commonly known as the cochlear saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The flowers, which are often pink or white, bloom in early summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
