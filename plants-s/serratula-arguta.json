It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, and its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges. Serratula arguta is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cooler climates. It has been used historically in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
