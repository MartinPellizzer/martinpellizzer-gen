    "intro": "Schisandra bicolor var. tuberculata, commonly known as the warty schisandra, is a rare variant of the schisandra plant native to specific regions of China. It is characterized by its distinctive warty texture on the fruit surface, which gives it its common name. The plant belongs to the Schisandraceae family and is known for its small, red berries that mature in the fall. Its botanical features include compound leaves with five to seven leaflets and yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
