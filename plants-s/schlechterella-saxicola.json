    "intro": "Schlechterella saxicola, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in arid and rocky environments. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its thin, leaf-like thallus with a distinctive greenish to yellowish color. The plant forms symbiotic relationships with algae and fungi, which provide it with nutrients and water in nutrient-poor soils. It is often found on limestone or sandstone surfaces, where it plays a role in weathering and soil formation. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental conditions."
