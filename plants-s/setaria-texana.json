    "intro": "Setaria texana, commonly known as Texas dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for native plant gardens."
