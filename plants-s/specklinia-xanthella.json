    "intro": "Specklinia xanthella, commonly known as the yellow-veined staghorn fern, is a species of polypod fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, tree-like appearance with a thick, fibrous root system that anchors it to trees or rocky surfaces. The fronds are typically broad, leathery, and have a rough, textured surface. It produces small, greenish-yellow spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the undersides of its fronds. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental species in tropical gardens."
