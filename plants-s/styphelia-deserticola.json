    "intro": "Styphelia deserticola, commonly known as the desert stonecrop, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of western North America. It features small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to desert and rocky environments. Styphelia deserticola is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
