    "intro": "Stachys teucriifolia, commonly known as creeping deadnettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, oval to lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of violet or white, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are sometimes used in herbal teas and are known for their mild, slightly peppery flavor."
