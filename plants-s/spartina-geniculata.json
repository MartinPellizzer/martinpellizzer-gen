    "intro": "Spartina geniculata, commonly known as salt marsh cordgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of North America. It thrives in brackish and saline wetlands, playing a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion. The plant has a distinctive zigzag stem, which helps it withstand strong tidal forces and wind. Its dense growth forms extensive salt marshes, providing habitat for various wildlife species. Spartina geniculata is also known for its ability to filter pollutants from water, contributing to water quality in coastal ecosystems."
