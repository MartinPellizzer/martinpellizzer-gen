    "intro": "Sonchus radicatus subsp. tectifolius, commonly known as the hairyleaf sowthistle, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, lobed leaves that are typically alternate along the stem. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
