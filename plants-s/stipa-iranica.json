    "intro": "Stipa iranica, commonly known as the Iranian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, awned florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps reduce water loss. Stipa iranica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and is of interest for ecological and botanical studies."
