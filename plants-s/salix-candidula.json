    "intro": "Salix candidula, commonly known as white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often silver- or white-haired stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. Its bark is smooth and grayish-white, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. Salix candidula is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
