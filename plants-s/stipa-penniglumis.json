    "intro": "Stipa penniglumis, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, slender inflorescences with small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in arid and semi-arid regions. Stipa penniglumis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
