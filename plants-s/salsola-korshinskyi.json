    "intro": "Salsola korshinskyi, commonly known as Russian thorn, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, bead-like fruits. It is often found in desert steppes and saline soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes. Salsola korshinskyi is also used in some traditional medicinal practices."
