    "intro": "Selaginella semicordata, commonly known as the running-maidenhair fern, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a terrestrial, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rosette of linear, spirally arranged leaves that are often reddish or bronze in color, especially when young. Its reproductive structures include microsporangia and megasporangia, which produce pollen and spores, respectively. Selaginella semicordata is notable for its ability to survive in arid conditions due to its desiccation-tolerant spores and specialized leaf structures."
