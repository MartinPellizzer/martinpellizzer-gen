    "intro": "Statice pubigera, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, showy blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its narrow, gray-green leaves are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Statice pubigera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to flourish in challenging coastal environments."
