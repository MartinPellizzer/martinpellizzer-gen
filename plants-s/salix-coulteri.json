    "intro": "Salix coulteri, commonly known as Coulter's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, typically in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, and it can grow in a variety of soil types, including sandy and rocky conditions. Coulter's willow is often found in riparian zones and is adapted to arid environments."
