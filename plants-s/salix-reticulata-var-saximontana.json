    "intro": "Salix reticulata var. saximontana, commonly known as the saximontana willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white\u7ed2\u6bdb. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
