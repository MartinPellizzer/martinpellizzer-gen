    "intro": "Sesuvium pedunculatum, commonly known as sea Purslane, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Americas. It features fleshy, prostrate stems that form a dense mat, often growing close to the ground. The plant produces small, pink or violet flowers that bloom in summer, followed by capsules containing numerous tiny seeds. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to store water and withstand salty air. Sesuvium pedunculatum is often found in rocky or sandy soils along shorelines, making it well-suited for coastal environments."
