    "intro": "Sabia meniscosta var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved sabia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It features lance-shaped leaves that are broader than the typical variety, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it adaptable to various soil types. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks."
