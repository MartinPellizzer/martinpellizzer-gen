    "intro": "Schefflera tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of leaves that give it a distinctive umbrella-like appearance. The leaves are typically thick, leathery, and covered in a fine, white, woolly coating, which gives the plant its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries. This plant is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
