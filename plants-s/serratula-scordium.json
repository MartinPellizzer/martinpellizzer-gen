    "intro": "Serratula scordium, commonly known as the garlic weed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions. Its name is derived from the garlic-like scent of its leaves, which can be both a distinguishing feature and a potential allergen."
