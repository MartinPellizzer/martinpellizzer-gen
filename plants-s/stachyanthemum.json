    "intro": "Stachyanthemum, commonly known as the silverleaf daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and other composite flowers. The plant is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and bright yellow flower heads that resemble daisies. Stachyanthemum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
