    "intro": "Selaginella purpuripes, commonly known as the purple spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are often tinged with purple, giving it its common name. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky outcrops. It exhibits a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus, which contains the spores. Selaginella purpuripes is also notable for its ability to survive in arid conditions due to its specialized water-storing tissues."
