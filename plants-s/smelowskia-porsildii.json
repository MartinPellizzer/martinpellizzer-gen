    "intro": "Smelowskia porsildii, commonly known as the Porsild's smelowskia, is a rare and endemic plant native to specific regions of northern Canada. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, often in alpine or arctic environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, with hairy stems and leaves. It has adapted to harsh climates through its compact growth form and deep root system. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
