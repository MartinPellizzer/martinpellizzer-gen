    "intro": "Santaloides minor, commonly known as the lesser sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces tiny, woody fruits that contain minute, black seeds. It is often found growing in lowland forests and is known for its fragrant wood, which has been used in traditional medicine and perfumery. Santaloides minor has a symbiotic relationship with certain fungi, which helps it absorb nutrients from the soil."
