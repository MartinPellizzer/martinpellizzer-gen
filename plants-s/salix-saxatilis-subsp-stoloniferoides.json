    "intro": "Salix saxatilis subsp. stoloniferoides, commonly known as the stoloniferous willow, is a shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often creeping stems that form dense mats or low-growing colonies. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in disturbed or arid environments."
