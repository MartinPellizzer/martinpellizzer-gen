    "intro": "Stryphnodendron paniculatum, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
