    "intro": "Saxifraga reniformis, commonly known as the kidney-shaped saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, kidney-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments."
