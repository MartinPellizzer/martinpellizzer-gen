    "intro": "Senegalia merrillii, commonly known as the whitebrush acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and small, feathery leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, which are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in pod-like fruits that split open to release the seeds. Senegalia merrillii is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in traditional landscaping and for soil stabilization in degraded areas."
