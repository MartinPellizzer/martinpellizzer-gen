It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that resemble spiders, giving it its common name.

Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns, and it produces a single, elongated inflorescence. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
