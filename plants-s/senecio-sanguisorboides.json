It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant features woolly, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. It produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Senecio sanguisorboides is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
