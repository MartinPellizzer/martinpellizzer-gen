    "intro": "Stellaria media var. aquatica, commonly known as water starwort, is a variant of the common chickweed that thrives in moist or aquatic environments. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, white star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its stems are prostrate, allowing it to spread across wet ground or shallow water. It is typically found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This variant is adapted to waterlogged soils and plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems."
