    "intro": "Securidaca ovata, commonly known as the African sweet pea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a legume pod that contains several seeds, which are dispersed when the pod splits open. The plant is often grown for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
