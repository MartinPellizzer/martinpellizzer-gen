    "intro": "Sebastiania hispida var. sclerophylla, commonly known as the rough-sepal sebastiania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers and rough, hairy leaves that give it its common name. It is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. The varietal form sclerophylla is distinguished by its more rigid, leathery foliage compared to the typical variety."
