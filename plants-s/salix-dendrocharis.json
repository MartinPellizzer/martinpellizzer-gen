    "intro": "Salix dendrocharis, commonly known as the tree willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and long, flexible branches that droop gracefully. The leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and have a smooth or slightly toothed margin, typically turning yellow in the fall. It produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in the spring, and its bark is often grayish with a flaky texture. This species is well adapted to wet or moist environments, often found near water bodies such as rivers and lakes."
