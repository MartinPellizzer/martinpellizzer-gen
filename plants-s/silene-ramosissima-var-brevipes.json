    "intro": "Silene ramosissima var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed campion, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink to white flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a bluish-gray hue due to dense pubescence. This variety is adapted to cold, rocky environments and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
