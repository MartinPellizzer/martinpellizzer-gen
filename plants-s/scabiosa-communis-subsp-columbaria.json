    "intro": "Scabiosa communis subsp. columbaria, commonly known as the dove's foot or snowball scabious, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that resemble snowballs. The plant produces small, oval, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the base. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in meadows and dry grasslands. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
