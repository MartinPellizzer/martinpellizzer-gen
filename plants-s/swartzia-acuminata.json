    "intro": "Swartzia acuminata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued for musical instruments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Swartzia acuminata is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its role in traditional medicine. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
