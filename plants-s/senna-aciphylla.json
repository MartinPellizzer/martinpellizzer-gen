    "intro": "Senna aciphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved senna, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often sparsely branched stems and small, narrow, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pods containing several seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing some drought tolerance. The species is sometimes used in traditional medicine and for soil stabilization in degraded landscapes."
