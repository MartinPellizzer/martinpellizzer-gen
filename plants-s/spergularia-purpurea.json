    "intro": "Spergularia purpurea, commonly known as sea sandwort, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in saline and sandy environments, often found along shorelines and in dunes. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. Spergularia purpurea plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
