It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense, spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help stabilize soil in marshy environments. Scirpus exilis is often found in shallow water or damp soils along the edges of ponds, lakes, and wetlands."
