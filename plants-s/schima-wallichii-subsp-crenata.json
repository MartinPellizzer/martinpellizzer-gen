    "intro": "Schima wallichii subsp. crenata, commonly known as the broad-leaf schima, is a shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas and southern China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with elliptical to ovate leaves that are often crenate or serrate at the margins. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, persistent capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in montane forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
