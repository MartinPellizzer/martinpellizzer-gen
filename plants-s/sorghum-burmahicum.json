    "intro": "Sorghum burmahicum, commonly known as Burmese sorghum, is a grass species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stalks and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces panicles of fluffy, white to brown seeds that are wind-dispersed. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in open fields or along roadsides. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used as a forage crop or for erosion control."
