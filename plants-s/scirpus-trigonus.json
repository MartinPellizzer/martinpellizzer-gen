    "intro": "Scirpus trigonus, commonly known as the three-angled bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along riverbanks. The plant has tall, triangular stems that are often covered with dense clusters of small, brownish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture that makes them useful in traditional crafts. Scirpus trigonus plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
