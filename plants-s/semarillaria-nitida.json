It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy, glossy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found growing in the undergrowth of rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists."
