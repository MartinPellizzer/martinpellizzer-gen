    "intro": "Salix alba var. monstruosa, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a striking cultivar of the white willow species. It is characterized by its cascading branches that drape like curtains, creating a dramatic and ethereal appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in early spring, which are followed by fluffy, cotton-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and ponds. Its rapid growth and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for landscaping and ornamental gardens."
