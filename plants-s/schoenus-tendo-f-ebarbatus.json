    "intro": "Schoenus tendo f. ebarbatus, commonly known as the woolly flat sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with a distinctive silver-gray appearance due to the presence of fine, silky hairs on its leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered at the tips of its stems. This variant is noted for its compact growth habit and is often used in ornamental landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to tolerate wet conditions."
