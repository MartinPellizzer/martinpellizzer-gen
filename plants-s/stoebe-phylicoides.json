    "intro": "Stoebe phylicoides, commonly known as narrowleaf honesty, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release its seeds, a feature that aids in its dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along roadsides. Stoebe phylicoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
