    "intro": "Sida mandonii, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring woody stems and hairy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots help it survive in dry conditions, and it is adapted to poor, sandy soils. Sida mandonii is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of these environments."
