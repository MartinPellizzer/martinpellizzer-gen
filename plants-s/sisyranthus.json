    "intro": "Sisyranthus, commonly known as the \"pink orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plants are characterized by their showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Sisyranthus species typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, often found on trees or rocks in humid environments. They play an important role in the ecosystems of their native habitats by providing nectar for pollinators."
