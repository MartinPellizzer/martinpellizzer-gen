    "intro": "Scirpus tabernaemontani f. sub-duvalii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a wetland plant characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and tall, cylindrical flower spikes. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has a robust root system that helps stabilize soil and filter water, contributing to wetland ecosystem health. Its flowering stems can reach heights of up to 2 meters, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance in providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
