    "intro": "Spergularia macrorrhiza, commonly known as the large-fruited sandspurry, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in sandy or calcareous soils, often found in coastal dunes and disturbed areas. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Spergularia macrorrhiza is also known for its ability to tolerate salt spray, making it a common species in coastal regions."
