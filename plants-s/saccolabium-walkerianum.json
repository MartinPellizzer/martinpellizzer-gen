    "intro": "Saccolabium walkerianum, commonly known as the yellow burr bush, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody shrub structure. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by distinctive burr-like seed pods. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, and it is adapted to dry, arid environments. Saccolabium walkerianum is often used in revegetation projects due to its resilience and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
