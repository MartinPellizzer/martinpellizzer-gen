    "intro": "Salviacanthus, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Pontederiaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in wetlands and marshy areas. The plant is characterized by its showy, water-lily-like flowers that bloom in vibrant shades of blue, purple, and white. Its leaves are broad and floating, often with a waxy surface to repel water. Salviacanthus species are valued for their ornamental beauty and have cultural significance in various indigenous communities."
