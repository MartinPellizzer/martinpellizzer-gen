    "intro": "Saurauia mollis, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silky baneberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, often hairy stems and compound leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by bright red berries that attract birds. Saurauia mollis thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitat."
