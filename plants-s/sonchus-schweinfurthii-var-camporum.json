    "intro": "Sonchus schweinfurthii var. camporum, commonly known as the Camp's sowthistle, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and alternate, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the daisy family. It is native to regions of Africa and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its rapid growth and potential invasiveness, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
