    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos foliolosus, commonly known as the leafy globe-star, is a rare and unusual member of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of spherical clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a compact appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
