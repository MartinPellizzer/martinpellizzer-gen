    "intro": "Stipa sibirica, commonly known as Siberian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia, including Siberia and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often adorned with long, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and steppes. Stipa sibirica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
