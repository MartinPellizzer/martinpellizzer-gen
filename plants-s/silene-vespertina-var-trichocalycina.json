It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are linear and slightly hairy, while the stems are erect and branching. The variety trichocalycina is distinguished by its dense, hairy calyces, giving it a unique appearance compared to the typical form of S. vespertina."
