The plant has narrow, silver-gray leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in dunes and rocky shores. Scandix pecten-veneris var. brevirostris is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal habitats."
