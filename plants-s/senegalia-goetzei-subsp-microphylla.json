    "intro": "Senegalia goetzei subsp. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved screwbean, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and yellow, pod-like fruits that contain compressed seeds. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in harsh, sandy soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration projects in desert environments."
