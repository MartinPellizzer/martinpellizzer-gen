    "intro": "Senecio renifolius, commonly known as the wooly senecio, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves that give it a distinctive, almost velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in dense, terminal clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
