    "intro": "Stevensia buxifolia, commonly known as the boxleaf stevensia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences. The plant features narrow, evergreen leaves that resemble those of boxwood, giving it its common name. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, Stevensia buxifolia is considered a rare and endangered species."
