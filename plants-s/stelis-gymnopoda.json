    "intro": "Stelis gymnopoda, commonly known as the naked-stem stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant typically has a short, unbranched stem and produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding environment. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is often found in shaded, humid forest habitats."
