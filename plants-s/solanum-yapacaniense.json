    "intro": "Solanum yapacaniense, commonly known as the Yapacani nightshade, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean region of Bolivia. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, showing adaptations to the arid conditions of its native environment. Its leaves are usually ovate with a rough texture, and the fruit is a small, berry-like structure that ripens to a yellow or orange color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Solanum yapacaniense is considered a rare and poorly studied species."
