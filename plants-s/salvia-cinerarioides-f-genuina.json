It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces striking blue-violet flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
