It is characterized by its delicate, hairy foliage that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are pinnate, with small, lance-shaped leaflets arranged along the central axis. Specklinia villosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in tropical conditions."
