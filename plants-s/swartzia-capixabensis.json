    "intro": "Swartzia capixabensis, commonly known as the Capixabense wood or Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the Fabaceae family. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. The plant is characterized by its dense, dark wood and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated pods containing flat, elongated seeds. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
