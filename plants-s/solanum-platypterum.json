    "intro": "Solanum platypterum, commonly known as the broad-winged nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, purple or white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its berries are toxic to humans and animals, containing alkaloids similar to those found in other members of the Solanaceae family. The plant's botanical features reflect its adaptation to harsh, dry conditions, with thick leaves and a compact growth form."
