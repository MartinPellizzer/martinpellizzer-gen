    "intro": "Squamellaria, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa and are characterized by their fleshy, tuberous roots and showy, often velvety leaves. The flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences and come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple. Squamellaria species are popular as ornamental plants due to their compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms. They prefer bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
