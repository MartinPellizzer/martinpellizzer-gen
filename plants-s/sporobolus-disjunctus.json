    "intro": "Sporobolus disjunctus, commonly known as the desert threeawn, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and spikelets that are loosely arranged along the stems. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that aid in its spread across arid environments. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant. Sporobolus disjunctus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
