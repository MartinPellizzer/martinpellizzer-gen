    "intro": "Stenotus acaulis, commonly known as the naked-stemmed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Stenotus acaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
