    "intro": "Sterculia francii, commonly known as the African mallow or African starfruit, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, featuring smooth, greyish bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with red stamens, which are followed by woody, star-shaped fruits. Its botanical significance lies in its ability to thrive in poor soils and its use in traditional medicine. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in its native habitat."
