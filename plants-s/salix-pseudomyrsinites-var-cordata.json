    "intro": "Salix pseudomyrsinites var. cordata, commonly known as the cordate willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
