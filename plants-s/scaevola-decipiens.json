    "intro": "Scaevola decipiens, commonly known as the false saltbush, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, arranged in clusters. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Scaevola decipiens is adapted to thrive in saline and coastal environments, making it a hardy species suited to harsh climates."
