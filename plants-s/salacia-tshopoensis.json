    "intro": "Salacia tshopoensis, commonly known as the Congo flame tree, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the Salaceae family and is characterized by its striking red and orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets and produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not widely consumed. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and conservation efforts. The species is also noted for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses."
