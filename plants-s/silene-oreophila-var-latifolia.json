    "intro": "Silene oreophila var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf mountain catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. This variety is distinguished by its wider leaves compared to the typical form of Silene oreophila. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
