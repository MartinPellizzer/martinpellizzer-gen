    "intro": "Stenanthemum reissekii, commonly known as the Reissek's stenanthemum, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Stenanthemum reissekii is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland heathlands."
