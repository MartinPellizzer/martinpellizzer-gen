    "intro": "Salix camusii, commonly known as the Kashmir willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are usually grayish-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. Its bark is thin and peels in strips, and it is often found in moist, mountainous regions. Salix camusii is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
