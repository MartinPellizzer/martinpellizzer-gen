    "intro": "Silene gallica var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal campion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its pink to red flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, thriving in salty and windy conditions. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh coastal environments. Silene gallica var. littoralis is often found in dunes and salt marshes, playing a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
