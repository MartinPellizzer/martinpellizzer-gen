    "intro": "Senega, commonly known as *Polygala senega*, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pale blue or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial shade. Senega is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats."
