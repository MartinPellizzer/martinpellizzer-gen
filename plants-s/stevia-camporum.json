    "intro": "Stevia camporum, commonly known as the Brazilian stevia, is a perennial herb native to South America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant is well-known for its intense sweetness, which comes from compounds called steviol glycosides found in its leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for both ornamental and medicinal use. Due to its natural sweetening properties, it is increasingly used as a natural alternative to sugar in various food products."
