    "intro": "Saxifraga striata var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The leaves are typically basal, with a rough, serrated edge and a bluish-green hue. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to colonize harsh, nutrient-poor habitats."
