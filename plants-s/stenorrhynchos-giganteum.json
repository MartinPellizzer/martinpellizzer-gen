It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 cm in diameter, often displaying vibrant colors such as yellow, orange, and red. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its humid, shaded habitat. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Stenorrhynchos giganteum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
