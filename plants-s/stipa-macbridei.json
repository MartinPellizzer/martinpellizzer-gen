    "intro": "Stipa macbridei, commonly known as the MacBride's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and steppe environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions."
