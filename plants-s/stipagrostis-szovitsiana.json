    "intro": "Stipagrostis szovitsiana, commonly known as the Hungarian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the grasslands of Hungary and surrounding regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
