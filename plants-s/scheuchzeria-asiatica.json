    "intro": "Scheuchzeria asiatica, commonly known as the Asian spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that bear small, scale-like leaves and produce spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes and swampy areas. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it plays a role in maintaining wetland ecosystems. Scheuchzeria asiatica is often used in traditional medicine and has ecological significance for supporting aquatic biodiversity."
