It features thick, fleshy stems covered in irregular, waxy tubercles that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a popular choice for cactus and succulent enthusiasts."
