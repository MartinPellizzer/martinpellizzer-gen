    "intro": "Sibirotrisetum sibiricum subsp. litorale, commonly known as the coastal sibirotrisetum, is a grass species native to the coastal regions of Eastern Europe and parts of Russia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. This subspecies is characterized by its low-growing, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion. Its flowering structures are typically small, spike-like inflorescences that produce lightweight seeds adapted for wind dispersal."
