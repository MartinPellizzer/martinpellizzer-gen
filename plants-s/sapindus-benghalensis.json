    "intro": "Sapindus benghalensis, commonly known as the soapberry tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces round, spiny fruits that contain a starchy, edible seed. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of saponins in the seeds, which give it a soapy quality and have been used traditionally for cleaning purposes. The tree is also valued for its ornamental value and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
