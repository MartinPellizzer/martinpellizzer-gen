    "intro": "Stelis tristyla, commonly known as the slender stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees in tropical rainforests, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often clustered in racemes. Its roots are specialized for attachment and water absorption, and it thrives in high humidity and indirect light. Stelis tristyla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
