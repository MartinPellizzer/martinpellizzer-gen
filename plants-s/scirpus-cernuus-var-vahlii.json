    "intro": "Scirpus cernuus var. vahlii, commonly known as the Vahli's bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers at the top of its stems, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands in shallow water or moist soils. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
