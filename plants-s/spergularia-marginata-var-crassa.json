    "intro": "Spergularia marginata var. crassa, commonly known as the thick-leaved sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to sandy and coastal environments. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its robust, succulent stems and broad, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or disturbed areas. Its thick leaves and ability to retain water make it well adapted to arid and coastal conditions."
