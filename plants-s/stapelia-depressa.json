    "intro": "Stapelia depressa, commonly known as the \"Carrion Flower,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and its unique, meaty-looking flowers that resemble decaying flesh. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts flies for pollination. Stapelia depressa is a low-growing perennial that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. It is often cultivated for its striking appearance and unusual blooming habits."
