    "intro": "Schoenoplectus triqueter f. macrostachys, commonly known as the broad-stalked bulrush, is a wetland plant characterized by its tall, robust stems and dense, grass-like foliage. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant produces large, cylindrical spike-like inflorescences that are often reddish-brown in color. Its rhizomes are extensive, allowing it to form dense colonies that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. This subspecies is notable for its larger staminal hairs compared to other forms of Schoenoplectus triqueter."
