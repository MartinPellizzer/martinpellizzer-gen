    "intro": "Schoenoplectus corymbosus var. brachyceras, commonly known as narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and dense, spike-like flower heads. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and the edges of streams. The plant has a robust rhizomatous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in late summer to early autumn. This variety is notable for its adaptability to a range of wetland habitats and its ecological importance in supporting aquatic life."
