    "intro": "Saussurea salicifolia var. chinensis, commonly known as Chinese yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It features a robust root system and upright, branched stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters, which bloom in summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and have a distinctive silvery-green color due to their dense pubescence. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses in Chinese herbal medicine."
