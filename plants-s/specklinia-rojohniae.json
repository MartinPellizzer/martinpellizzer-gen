    "intro": "Specklinia rojohniae, commonly known as the Rojohn's pigmy orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the rainy season. It is well adapted to life on trees, with aerial roots that absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
