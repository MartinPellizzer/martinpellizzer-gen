    "intro": "Sempervivum mutabile, commonly known as the wandering jew or variegated houseleek, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe. It features fleshy, basal leaves that form a rosette and often display striking variegation in green, white, and pink. The plant is known for its ability to produce offsets, which can be easily propagated to create new plants. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Sempervivum mutabile is also notable for its resilience, able to survive in harsh conditions due to its thick, water-storing leaves."
