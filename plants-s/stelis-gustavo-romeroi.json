    "intro": "Stelis gustavo-romeroi, commonly known as the Gustavo-Romero orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often arranged in a raceme. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich substrates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
