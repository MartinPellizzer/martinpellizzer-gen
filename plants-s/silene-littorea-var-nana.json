    "intro": "Silene littorea var. nana, commonly known as coastal dwarf campion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, tolerating salt spray and fluctuating moisture levels. The plant features small, pink or white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and hardy nature make it well-suited for coastal gardens and ecological restoration projects. Silene littorea var. nana plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local wildlife."
