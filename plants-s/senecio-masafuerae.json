It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and has adapted to survive in harsh conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are yellow and bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
