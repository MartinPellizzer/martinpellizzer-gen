It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiny pod, which aids in seed dispersal. Securigera hyrcana is often used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
