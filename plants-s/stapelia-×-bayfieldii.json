    "intro": "Stapelia \u00d7 bayfieldii, commonly known as the hybrid starfish plant, is a succulent hybrid resulting from the cross between Stapelia nobilis and Stapelia gigantea. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of succulent plants. The plant produces vibrant, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, often with a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires ample sunlight to maintain its compact, bushy growth habit. Stapelia \u00d7 bayfieldii is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
