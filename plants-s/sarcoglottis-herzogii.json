    "intro": "Sarcoglottis herzogii, commonly known as the Herzog's sarcoglottis, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. Its fruits are fleshy berries that contain several seeds, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species in botanical studies."
