    "intro": "Spirodela oligorrhiza var. javanica, commonly known as the water velvet, is a floating aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silky layer of air-filled cells, which help it stay buoyant. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and lakes. Due to its rapid growth rate, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
