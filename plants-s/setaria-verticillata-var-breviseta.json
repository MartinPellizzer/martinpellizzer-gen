It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats. It has a fibrous root system and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its ability to thrive in various soil conditions makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
