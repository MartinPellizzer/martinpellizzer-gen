It typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters and features slender, branched stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters at the leaf axils, giving it its species name \"lateriflora,\" meaning \"side-flowered.\" Its leaves are opposite, narrow, and often hairy, with a slightly succulent texture. Stellaria lateriflora thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along roadsides."
