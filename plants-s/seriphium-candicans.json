    "intro": "Seriphium candicans, commonly known as the showy whitlowgrass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. Its leaves are linear and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Seriphium candicans is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ecological importance to pollinators."
