It features small, glossy, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces fragrant, white, clustered flowers in late spring, which are followed by small, red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive foliage and subtle floral display."
