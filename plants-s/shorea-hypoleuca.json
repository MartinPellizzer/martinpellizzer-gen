    "intro": "Shorea hypoleuca, commonly known as white ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The tree can grow up to 40 meters tall and has a straight trunk with a smooth, greyish-brown bark. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in spikes. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
