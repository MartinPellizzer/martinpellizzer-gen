    "intro": "Succisa rigida, commonly known as rigid succis, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with slender stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in umbels. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland margins or along stream banks. Succisa rigida is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
