It features a slender, unbranched trunk covered in smooth, dark green leaves that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that eventually develop into edible, chocolate-colored fruits. Its leaves are large and pinnate, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. Saribus chocolatinus is well adapted to humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
