    "intro": "Sida palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's sida, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species belonging to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its small, white to pale purple flowers are clustered in racemes, and it produces small, hairy fruits known as schizocarps. Sida palmeri is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of these regions."
