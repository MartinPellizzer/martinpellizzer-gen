It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature vivid colors and intricate patterns. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often borne on long, slender pedicels. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the humid, shaded environments where it thrives. Stigmatodon francae is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forest understories or along stream banks."
