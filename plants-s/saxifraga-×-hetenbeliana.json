    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 hetenbeliana, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens for its compact growth and striking floral displays."
