    "intro": "Senecio aequinoctialis, commonly known as the autumn crocus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces a distinctive, helmet-shaped seed capsule that splits open to release its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is widely cultivated in gardens across temperate regions."
