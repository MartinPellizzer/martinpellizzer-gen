    "intro": "Stanhopea javieri, commonly known as the Java orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange with red or purple markings. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks rather than in soil. Its leaves are usually elongated and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Stanhopea javieri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
