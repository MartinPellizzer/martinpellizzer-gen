    "intro": "Saxifraga aquatica var. virgata, commonly known as the water saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in moist environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for wetland restoration and ecological landscaping."
