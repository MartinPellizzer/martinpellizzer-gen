    "intro": "Solidago speciosa, commonly known as showy goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow inflorescences that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and stream banks. Its showy flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees, butterflies, and beetles. Solidago speciosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in diverse soil conditions."
