    "intro": "Salix davidiana, commonly known as the Chinese willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Salix davidiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
