    "intro": "Saccopetalum, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the Malvaceae family. It is native to coastal regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, where it thrives in saline and humid environments. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often with a distinctive, sac-like structure at the base of the petals. Saccopetalum species typically have thick, waxy leaves that help them retain moisture in coastal conditions. These plants are often used in ornamental gardening due to their striking appearance and adaptability to coastal climates."
