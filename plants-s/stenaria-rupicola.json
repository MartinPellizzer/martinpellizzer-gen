    "intro": "Stenaria rupicola, commonly known as the rock stenaria, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its root system is extensive and adapted to anchor it in rocky or sandy soils. Stenaria rupicola is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in crevices, where it thrives in full sun and low moisture conditions."
