    "intro": "Stephanachne nigrescens, commonly known as blackstem sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes help it spread and form dense colonies in moist soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
