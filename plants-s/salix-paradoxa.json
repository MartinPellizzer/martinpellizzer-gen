    "intro": "Salix paradoxa, commonly known as the paradoxical willow, is a deciduous tree native to central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, elongated leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its bark is smooth and light gray, often peeling in thin, papery layers. Salix paradoxa is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions."
