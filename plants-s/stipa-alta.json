    "intro": "Stipa alta, commonly known as tall feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tall stalks and feathery plumes that give it a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant typically grows in open areas such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers in late spring to early summer. Stipa alta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
