    "intro": "Sisymbrium japonicum, commonly known as Japanese winter cress, is an annual flowering plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and alternate leaves that are oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its seeds are enclosed in a long, slender pod that splits open when mature to disperse the seeds. Sisymbrium japonicum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
