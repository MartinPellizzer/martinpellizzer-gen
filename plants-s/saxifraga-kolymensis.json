It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in harsh, cold environments, often found in tundra and alpine habitats. The plant features small, clustered leaves and produces delicate white or pinkish flowers. It is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstands extreme temperature fluctuations. Its resilience makes it a symbol of hardiness in extreme climates."
