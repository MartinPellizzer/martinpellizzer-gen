It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that resemble those of almond trees, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported therapeutic properties. Synaedrys amygdalifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
