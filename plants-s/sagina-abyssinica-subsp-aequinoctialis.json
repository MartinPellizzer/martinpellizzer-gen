    "intro": "Sagina abyssinica subsp. aequinoctialis, commonly known as the African snowgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in rock gardens."
