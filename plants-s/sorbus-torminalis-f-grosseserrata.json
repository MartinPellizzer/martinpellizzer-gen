It is characterized by its distinctive serrated leaves, which are broader and more coarsely toothed compared to the typical species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by bright red berries in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and hedgerows. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
