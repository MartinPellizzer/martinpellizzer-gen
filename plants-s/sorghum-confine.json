    "intro": "Sorghum confine, commonly known as broomcorn millet, is a warm-season grass native to Africa and widely cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, feathery panicles that produce numerous tiny grains. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soil conditions, making it a valuable crop in many developing countries. Its botanical name, *Sorghum bicolor*, reflects its classification within the grass family, Poaceae. The plant's versatility extends beyond food, as it is also used for livestock feed, biofuel production, and construction materials."
