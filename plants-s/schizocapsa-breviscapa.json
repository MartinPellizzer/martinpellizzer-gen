    "intro": "Schizocapsa breviscapa, commonly known as the short-capped schizocapsa, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring, often in shades of pink or white. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Schizocapsa breviscapa is considered a species of conservation concern."
