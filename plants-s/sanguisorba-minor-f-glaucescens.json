    "intro": "Sanguisorba minor f. glaucescens, commonly known as the glaucous narrowleaf sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern Asia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a bluish-gray waxy coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish-red flower clusters in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in partial shade."
