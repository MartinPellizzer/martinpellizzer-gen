It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features erect, branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its showy yellow inflorescences consist of numerous small, composite flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics."
