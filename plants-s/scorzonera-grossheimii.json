    "intro": "Scorzonera grossheimii, commonly known as the Alpine scorzonera, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces a tuberous root that is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Scorzonera grossheimii thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its growth cycle is closely tied to the seasonal changes of its high-altitude habitat."
