    "intro": "Schoenorchis tixieri, commonly known as the Tixier's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal relationships for nutrient uptake. Its flowers, which are usually pale green or white, bloom in late spring to early summer, and the species is noted for its limited distribution and conservation status. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Schoenorchis tixieri is considered endangered in many parts of its native range."
