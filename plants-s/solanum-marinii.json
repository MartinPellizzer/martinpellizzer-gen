    "intro": "Solanum marinii, commonly known as the coastal nightshade, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale purple, which bloom in the evening. Its fruit is a small, globose berry that turns from green to yellow as it matures. Solanum marinii is adapted to saline environments and is often found in areas with high exposure to sea spray."
