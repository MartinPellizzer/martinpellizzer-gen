    "intro": "Schoenus tendo, commonly known as the swamp grass or slender bulrush, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in southern Africa. It typically grows in marshy areas, riverbanks, and shallow water bodies, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often submerged or floating, adapting to its aquatic habitat. Schoenus tendo plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
