    "intro": "Selaginella distans, commonly known as the common spike moss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like appearance. It is a vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant features small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a unique, moss-like appearance. Selaginella distans is known for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and has adapted to retain water efficiently. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are borne on the upper part of the plant and contain spores for propagation."
