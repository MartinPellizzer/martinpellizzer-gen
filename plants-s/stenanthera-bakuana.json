    "intro": "Stenanthera bakuana, commonly known as the Bakuan orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of South Korea. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, while its inflorescence consists of a single, upright spike bearing several small, white to pale pink flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stenanthera bakuana is considered a threatened species."
