    "intro": "Statice rouyana, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It belongs to the family Plumbaginaceae and is characterized by its spikes of blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its narrow, linear leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it retain moisture. Statice rouyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in dried flower arrangements."
