It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. It is a perennial herb that thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
