It is characterized by its unique, hairy, and often fleshy leaves that resemble a rabbit's foot, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Scaphyglottis cuniculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
