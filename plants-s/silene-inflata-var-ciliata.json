    "intro": "Silene inflata var. ciliata, commonly known as the hairy bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like pods that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with five petals that are arranged symmetrically. The species is notable for its unique seed dispersal mechanism, where the pods explosively release seeds when disturbed."
