    "intro": "Spiranthes eriophora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ladies' tresses, is a perennial orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive spiral arrangement of flowers, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and bogs. It produces small, white or greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Spiranthes eriophora is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in natural landscapes."
