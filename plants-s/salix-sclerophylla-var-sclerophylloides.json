It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often densely hairy on the underside. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in high-altitude ecosystems."
