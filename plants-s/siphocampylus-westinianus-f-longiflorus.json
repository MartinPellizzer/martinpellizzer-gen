    "intro": "Siphocampylus westinianus f. longiflorus, commonly known as the long-flowered siphocampylus, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific alpine regions. It is characterized by its elongated, slender leaves and striking, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and well-drained soil. Its floral structure is adapted for pollination by specific insect species, which play a crucial role in its reproductive cycle. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
