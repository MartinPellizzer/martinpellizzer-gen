It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and showy, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, woody fruits called follicles, which contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Sarothamnus megalanthus is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience to drought."
