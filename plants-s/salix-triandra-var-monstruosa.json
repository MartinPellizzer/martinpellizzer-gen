    "intro": "Salix triandra var. monstruosa, commonly known as the giant weeping willow, is a striking variant of the weeping willow species. It is characterized by its exceptionally long, drooping branches that can extend over 30 feet, creating a dramatic, cascading appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a silvery underside that shimmers in the light. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often planted near water bodies for its ornamental value."
