    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos polyotis, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and specialized plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and unique floral structure. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates, showcasing adaptations to nutrient-poor environments. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and often have a distinctive coloration that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
