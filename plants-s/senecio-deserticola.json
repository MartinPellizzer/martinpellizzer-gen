    "intro": "Senecio deserticola, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, herbaceous annual or perennial plant with narrow, silvery-green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in sandy or rocky soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat. Senecio deserticola is often found in desert scrub and grassland ecosystems."
