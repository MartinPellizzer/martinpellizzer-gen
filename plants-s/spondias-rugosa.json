    "intro": "Spondias rugosa, commonly known as the rough skin apple, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The tree produces edible fruits that are typically red or orange when mature, with a tart, acidic flavor. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture. Spondias rugosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
