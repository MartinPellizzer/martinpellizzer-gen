    "intro": "Salix pyracanthoides, commonly known as the African willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, typical of the genus Salix. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a distinctive flaky texture that peels in thin layers. Salix pyracanthoides is often found in riverine habitats and is adapted to seasonal flooding, making it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
