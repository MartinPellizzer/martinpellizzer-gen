    "intro": "Subularia, commonly known as the common subularia, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Primulaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are small, herbaceous plants native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal leaves that are linear to ovate in shape, and they produce small, clustered flowers that can be white, pink, or purple. Subularia species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
