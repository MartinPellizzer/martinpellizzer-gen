    "intro": "Salix longifolia f. wheeleri, commonly known as Wheeler's willow, is a rare and distinctive variant of the common willow. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are often tinged with a pale green or silver hue. This subspecies typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wetlands. Its flowers are catkins, which are typical of the Salicaceae family, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
