    "intro": "Stevia subpubescens var. typica, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs, which contribute to its intense sweetness. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its roots and leaves are used in traditional medicine for their sweetening properties and potential health benefits. Stevia subpubescens var. typica is often cultivated as a natural alternative to sugar due to its high steviol glycoside content."
