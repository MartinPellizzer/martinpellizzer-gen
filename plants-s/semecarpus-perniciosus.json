It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The fruit is a hard, spiny capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is known for its toxic properties, particularly in its seeds and bark. It is often found in moist, shaded environments in tropical forests. The plant has been used in traditional medicine, though its use is generally discouraged due to its potential toxicity."
