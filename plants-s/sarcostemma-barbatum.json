It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated margin. Its flowers are typically yellow or white, and it produces small, toxic berries that are a source of concern in some regions. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in cultivation and requires caution during handling."
