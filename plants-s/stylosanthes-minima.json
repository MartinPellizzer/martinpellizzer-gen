    "intro": "Stylosanthes minima, commonly known as the dwarf stylosanthes, is a small, annual legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is well adapted to arid and poor soils, making it a valuable forage species in dryland agriculture. It has a deep root system that helps in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility. Stylosanthes minima is also used in erosion control and as a cover crop due to its rapid growth and hardiness."
