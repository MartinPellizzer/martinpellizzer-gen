It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and related species. The plant is characterized by its showy, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth texture. The fruit is a follicle, which splits open to release the seeds, aiding in the plant's dispersal."
