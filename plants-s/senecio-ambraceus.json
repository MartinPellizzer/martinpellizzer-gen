    "intro": "Senecio ambraceus, commonly known as the African daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. Senecio ambraceus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance once established."
