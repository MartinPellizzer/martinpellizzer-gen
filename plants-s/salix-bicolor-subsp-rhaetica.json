    "intro": "Salix bicolor subsp. rhaetica, commonly known as the Rhaetian willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous areas with cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species within its native range."
