    "intro": "Smilax bona-nox subsp. hederifolia, commonly known as the creeping smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It features a climbing habit with stout, thorny stems that help it ascend vegetation. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, broadly ovate, and often have a waxy texture. The fruit is a red, fleshy berry that contains several seeds, typical of the Smilacaceae family."
