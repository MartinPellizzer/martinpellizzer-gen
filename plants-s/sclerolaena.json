It consists of several species, most of which are native to Africa and are characterized by their succulent, often hairy leaves. The plants typically have showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, attracting various pollinators. Sclerolaena species are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing their adaptability to drought conditions. Their latex-like sap, which is milky and sometimes toxic, is a notable botanical feature."
