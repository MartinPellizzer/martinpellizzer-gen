    "intro": "Solanum mandonis, commonly known as the Mandon's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or white. The plant produces berries that are initially green and turn red when ripe, though they are toxic and not suitable for human consumption. Solanum mandonis is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
