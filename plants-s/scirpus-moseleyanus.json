    "intro": "Scirpus moseleyanus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers that appear in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically ranging from 20 to 60 centimeters in length. Scirpus moseleyanus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
