    "intro": "Saxifraga maweana var. oscillans, commonly known as the oscillating saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
