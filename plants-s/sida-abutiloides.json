    "intro": "Sida abutiloides, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in the summer months. Its seeds are encased in a fibrous, capsule-like structure that splits open when mature. Sida abutiloides is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
