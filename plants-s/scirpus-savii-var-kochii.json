    "intro": "Scirpus savii var. kochii, commonly known as the Koch's bulrush, is a variant of the bulrush species native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is a tall, herbaceous plant that typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown flowers during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. Scirpus savii var. kochii plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
