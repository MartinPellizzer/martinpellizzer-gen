It features arrow-shaped leaves that are broad and often float on the water's surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, typically in late summer. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
