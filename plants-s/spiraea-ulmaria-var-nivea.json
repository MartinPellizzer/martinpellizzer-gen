    "intro": "Spiraea ulmaria var. nivea, commonly known as white meadow spiraea, is a flowering shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped, with a slightly serrated edge, and they turn a striking red or orange in the fall. This variety is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
