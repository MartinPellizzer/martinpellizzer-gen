    "intro": "Sempervivum pulverulentum, commonly known as the dusty life plant, is a succulent species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves covered in a fine layer of white powder, which gives it its common name. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, rocky environments due to its drought-resistant properties. It produces small, pink or purple flowers in the spring, adding a subtle floral touch to its compact form. Sempervivum pulverulentum is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
