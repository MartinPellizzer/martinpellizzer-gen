    "intro": "Sapium terminale, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that turn bright yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange to red, spherical fruits that split open to release seeds. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular ornamental plant, though it is also considered invasive in some regions. The plant has a smooth, grayish bark and can reach heights of up to 30 meters in its native habitat."
