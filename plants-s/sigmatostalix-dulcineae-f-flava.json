It is characterized by its vibrant yellow inflorescences that contrast with its deep green foliage. The plant belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is known for its aromatic leaves and showy flowers. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral morphology and limited distribution. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
