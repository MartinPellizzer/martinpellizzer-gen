    "intro": "Salix kazbekensis, commonly known as the Kazbegi willow, is a shrub native to the Caucasus region, particularly in Georgia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found near rivers or in mountainous areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
