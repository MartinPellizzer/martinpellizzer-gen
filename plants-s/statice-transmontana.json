    "intro": "Statice transmontana, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in coastal areas and saline soils, making it highly adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy or rocky soils, contributing to coastal erosion control. Statice transmontana is often used in ornamental gardening due to its drought tolerance and long-lasting blooms."
