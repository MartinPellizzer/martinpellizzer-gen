    "intro": "Sabina multiova, commonly known as the Chinese thuja, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to China. It features scale-like leaves that are densely packed on its branches, giving it a compact and ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, typically in the fall. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a hedge. Its hardy nature allows it to thrive in a variety of climates, though it is more suited to cooler regions."
