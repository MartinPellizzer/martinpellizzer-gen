    "intro": "Sorghum vulgare var. durra, commonly known as durra, is a staple cereal grain native to Africa. It is a tall, grass-like plant that produces dense panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant is drought-resistant and thrives in warm, arid climates, making it well-suited for semi-arid regions. Its leaves are broad and sword-shaped, while the stems are sturdy and fibrous. The grain is harvested from the panicles and is used for food, animal feed, and biofuel production."
