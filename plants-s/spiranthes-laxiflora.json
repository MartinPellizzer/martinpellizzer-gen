It is characterized by its delicate, spiraling arrangement of pale green to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. It has a rhizomatous root system and produces small, inconspicuous leaves. The flowers are pollinated by various insects, including bees and wasps, and the plant is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value."
