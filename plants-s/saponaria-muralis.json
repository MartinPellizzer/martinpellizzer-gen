    "intro": "Saponaria muralis, commonly known as wallflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red, often with a yellow center. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils, thriving in sunny locations. Its stems are often hairy, and the leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. Saponaria muralis is also noted for its ability to produce a soapy substance when its leaves are crushed, giving it its scientific name."
