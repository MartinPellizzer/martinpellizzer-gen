    "intro": "Scirpus cyperinus var. pedicellatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense stands that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. It is also valued for its ability to filter water and improve water quality in wetland ecosystems."
