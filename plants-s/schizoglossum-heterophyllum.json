    "intro": "Schizoglossum heterophyllum, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small stars. The plant has a compact, succulent growth form, with hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers bloom in shades of yellow and orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Schizoglossum heterophyllum is adapted to extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species in desert ecosystems."
