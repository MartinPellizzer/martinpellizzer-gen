    "intro": "Stachys palustris var. insularis, commonly known as the marsh woundwort, is a perennial herb native to wetland environments in North America. It features upright, hairy stems that often grow up to 60 cm tall, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish to purple flowers in the early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its compact growth habit and its ability to tolerate periodic flooding."
