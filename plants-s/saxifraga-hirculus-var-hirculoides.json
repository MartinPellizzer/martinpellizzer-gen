    "intro": "Saxifraga hirculus var. hirculoides, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky mountainous regions. It typically features rosettes of fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
