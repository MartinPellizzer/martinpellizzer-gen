    "intro": "Salix taiwanalpina var. takasagoalpina, commonly known as the Takasago alpine willow, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of Taiwan. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it typically blooms in the spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
