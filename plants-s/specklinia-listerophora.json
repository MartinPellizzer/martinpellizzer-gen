    "intro": "Specklinia listerophora, commonly known as the Lister's pigmy orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in high humidity and requires indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
