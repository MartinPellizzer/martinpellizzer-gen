    "intro": "Stipa lagascae, commonly known as the Lagasce needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both sterile and flowering florets. It thrives in dry, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Stipa lagascae plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
