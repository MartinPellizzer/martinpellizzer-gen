    "intro": "Salix nummularia, commonly known as silver willow, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense colonies, making it a hardy plant that thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Salix nummularia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize soil along waterways."
