    "intro": "Solidago missouriensis var. glaberrima, commonly known as the Missouri goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the central United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow composite flower heads that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies during the autumn season."
