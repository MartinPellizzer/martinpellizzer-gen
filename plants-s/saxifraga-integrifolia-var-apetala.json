It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that often lack petals. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are typically entire, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food and shelter for various invertebrates."
