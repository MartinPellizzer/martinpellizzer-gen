    "intro": "Selago ovata, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts when mature. Selago ovata is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in environments with limited water availability. Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
