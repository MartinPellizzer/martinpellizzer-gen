    "intro": "Smilax mauritanica subsp. vespertilionis, commonly known as the evening bat smilax, is a climbing vine native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its woody stems and spiny tendrils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in spadices, followed by bright red berries. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in forests or along riverbanks. Its name is derived from the association with bats, as its fruit is a common food source for these nocturnal animals."
