    "intro": "Spiranthes ochracea, commonly known as the yellow spire orchid, is a species of orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, spiraling arrangement of flowers that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetlands, bogs, and other moist environments, often forming dense colonies. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with three sepals and three petals, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Spiranthes ochracea is an ephemeral plant, often blooming for only a short period during the late spring or early summer."
