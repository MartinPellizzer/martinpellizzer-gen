It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It has a taproot system that is often used in traditional medicine. This variant is distinguished by its more slender growth habit compared to the typical form of Scorzonera radiata."
