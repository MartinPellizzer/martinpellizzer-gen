    "intro": "Salvia eremostachya, commonly known as the desert sage, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems, narrow lance-shaped leaves, and striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in sandy or rocky soils. Its flowering period attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. Salvia eremostachya is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
