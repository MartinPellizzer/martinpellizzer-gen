It belongs to the family Loasaceae and is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange flowers with prominent stamens. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and has adapted to thrive in harsh, dry conditions. Its leaves are usually small and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The showy struthanthus is known for its brief but striking bloom period, often occurring in late spring or early summer."
