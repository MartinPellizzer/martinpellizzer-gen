    "intro": "Siphocampylus ayersiae, commonly known as the Ayers' siphocampylus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Siphocampylus ayersiae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
