    "intro": "Salvia sciaphila, commonly known as the shade-loving sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of down. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its unique color and habitat requirements, it is a sought-after plant for shade gardens and conservation efforts."
