    "intro": "Schinus marchandii, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, bright red berries that are a key feature of the plant. The leaves are typically alternate, simple, and have a leathery texture with a fragrant aroma. Schinus marchandii thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. It has been introduced to other regions, including Florida, where it has become an invasive species."
