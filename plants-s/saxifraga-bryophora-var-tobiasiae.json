    "intro": "Saxifraga bryophora var. tobiasiae, commonly known as the Tobias's saxifrage, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous habitats with high levels of sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
