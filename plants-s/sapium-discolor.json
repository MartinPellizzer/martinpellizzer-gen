    "intro": "Sapium discolor, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its striking, papery bracts that turn red or orange in autumn, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces small, green berries that mature to a dark red color, containing seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a smooth margin. Sapium discolor is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
