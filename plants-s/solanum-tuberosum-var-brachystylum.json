It produces small tubers that are typically less than 5 cm in diameter, making it suitable for small gardens or container growing. The plant has hairy stems and leaves with a distinct, slightly serrated edge. It is adapted to cooler climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible tubers. This variety is also valued for its resistance to certain diseases compared to standard potato cultivars."
