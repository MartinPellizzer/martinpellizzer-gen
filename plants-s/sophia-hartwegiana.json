    "intro": "Sophia hartwegiana, commonly known as the Hartweg's sophia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in montane forests. Its flowers are usually small and white or pale pink, with a subtle fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
