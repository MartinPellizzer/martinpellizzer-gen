    "intro": "Serpyllopsis caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted serpyllopsis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in grassland habitats, often in dry or semi-arid regions. The plant forms dense tufts or clumps, with slender, erect stems that bear small, clustered flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers are usually pale blue or purple in color. Serpyllopsis caespitosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact growth habit and delicate floral display."
