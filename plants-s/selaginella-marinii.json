    "intro": "Selaginella marinii, commonly known as the coastal spike moss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to saline and arid conditions. The plant has compact, scale-like leaves that form dense mats, which help reduce water loss. It reproduces via spores and is often found in dune environments. Selaginella marinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils."
