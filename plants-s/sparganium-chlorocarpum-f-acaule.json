    "intro": "Sparganium chlorocarpum f. acaule, commonly known as the slender bur reed, is a rare and distinctive aquatic plant characterized by its reduced stem structure. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which are often submerged or partially emergent. Its leaves are narrow and cylindrical, forming dense clusters around the base of the plant. This form is notable for its lack of a prominent above-water stem, distinguishing it from other forms of Sparganium."
