    "intro": "Scirpus scleropus, commonly known as hardstem bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its stiff, upright stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Scirpus scleropus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
