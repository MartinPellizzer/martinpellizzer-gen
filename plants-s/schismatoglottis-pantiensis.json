    "intro": "Schismatoglottis pantiensis, commonly known as the Panam\u00e1 slipper orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically deep purple or violet in color. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with multiple stems forming a dense, compact rosette. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, lowland habitat. Schismatoglottis pantiensis is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses due to its specific care requirements."
