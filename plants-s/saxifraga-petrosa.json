    "intro": "Saxifraga petrosa, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in crevices and on rocky outcrops, thriving in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces basal rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves and bears clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It is characterized by its succulent foliage and is often found in high-altitude environments. Saxifraga petrosa is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a hardy species in cold climates."
