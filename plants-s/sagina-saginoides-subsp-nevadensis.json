    "intro": "Sagina saginoides subsp. nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra sagina, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its tiny, rounded leaves and small white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in moist, rocky habitats, often found in alpine and subalpine regions. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture in arid environments, and it reproduces primarily through seeds. This subspecies is adapted to high-altitude conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects in its native range."
