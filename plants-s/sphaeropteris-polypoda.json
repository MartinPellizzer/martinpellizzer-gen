    "intro": "Sphaeropteris polypoda, commonly known as the broad-leafed cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones typically growing on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth rate, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
