    "intro": "Spiraea latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features slender, arching stems that bear clusters of white to pink flowers in early summer. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, and they turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. This plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
