    "intro": "Solanum oocarpum, commonly known as the giant nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a perennial shrub that can grow up to 3 meters in height, featuring large, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by large, green berries that turn red when mature. These berries contain toxic alkaloids, making the plant potentially harmful to humans and animals. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ecologically significant species in its native habitats."
