It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed, silver-green leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces showy yellow flowers arranged in dense, composite inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to the southwestern United States, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun.
