    "intro": "Scirpus muscosus, commonly known as the common bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can form extensive underwater root systems, contributing to soil stabilization. Scirpus muscosus thrives in shallow water or moist soils, making it a common species in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes."
