    "intro": "Selaginella didymostachya var. densa, commonly known as the dense-stemmed spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a low-growing, herbaceous plant with a rosette-like structure composed of fleshy, scale-like leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the reproductive organs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
