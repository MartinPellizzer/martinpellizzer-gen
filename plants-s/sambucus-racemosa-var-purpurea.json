    "intro": "Sambucus racemosa var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and have serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible when fully ripe but contain toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and forest edges."
