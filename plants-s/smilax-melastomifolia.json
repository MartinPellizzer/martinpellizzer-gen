    "intro": "Smilax melastomifolia, commonly known as the Florida smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It features woody stems covered in sharp, spiny tubercles, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a smooth, glossy texture. Smilax melastomifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swamps, hammocks, and along stream banks."
