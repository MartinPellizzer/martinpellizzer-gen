    "intro": "Saccolabium serrulatum, commonly known as the serrated saccolabium, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in its native habitat."
