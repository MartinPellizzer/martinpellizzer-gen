    "intro": "Solanum microtatanthum, commonly known as the small-leaved nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by livestock and humans."
