    "intro": "Sorbus hupehensis var. obtusa, commonly known as the Chinese whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by white, spherical berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
