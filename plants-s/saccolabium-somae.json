    "intro": "Saccolabium somae, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod, which splits open when mature to release the seeds. Saccolabium somae is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with suitable climates."
