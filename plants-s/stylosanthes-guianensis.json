The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, flat pods containing several seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it a valuable forage plant in dry regions. Stylosanthes guianensis is also known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
