    "intro": "Salix myrsinifolia subsp. borealis, commonly known as the northern willow, is a shrub native to Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and its flowers are usually greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra or wetland habitats. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environments."
