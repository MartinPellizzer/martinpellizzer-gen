    "intro": "Sida quinqueangulata, commonly known as five-angled sida, is an annual herb native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale green leaves with five angular lobes. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Sida quinqueangulata is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
