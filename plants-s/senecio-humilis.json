    "intro": "Senecio humilis, commonly known as the dwarf groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South Africa. It features small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover."
