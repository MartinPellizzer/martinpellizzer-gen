    "intro": "Schiedeella violacea, commonly known as the violet sandalwood, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the wet tropical forests of Queensland, Australia. It is a small, shrub-like plant characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers. The plant produces woody, cylindrical fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Schiedeella violacea is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments and is highly sensitive to habitat disturbance. Due to its limited distribution and threats from land clearing, it is critically important for conservation efforts."
