    "intro": "Selaginella cuprea var. major, commonly known as the copper moss or red spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern-like plant native to arid and rocky environments. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves that range in color from bright green to reddish-brown. The plant produces spores in small, cone-like structures called strobila, which are typically found at the base of the plant. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with a thick cuticle on its leaves to reduce water loss. This species is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
