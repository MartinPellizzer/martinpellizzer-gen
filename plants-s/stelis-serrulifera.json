    "intro": "Stelis serrulifera, commonly known as the serrulate orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces strikingly colored flowers, often in shades of white, pink, and purple, with intricate patterns on the petals. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a rosette formation, aiding in moisture retention. Stelis serrulifera thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches in tropical rainforests."
