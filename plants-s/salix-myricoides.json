    "intro": "Salix myricoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist environments such as streambanks and wetlands, making it an important species for stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife. The bark and leaves have been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for various medicinal and practical purposes."
