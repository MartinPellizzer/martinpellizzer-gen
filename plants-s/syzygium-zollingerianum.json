    "intro": "Syzygium zollingerianum, commonly known as the Zollinger's apple or the white apple, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, round fruits with a crisp, juicy pulp. The fruit is often consumed fresh or used in traditional remedies due to its mild flavor and nutritional value. It thrives in humid climates and is often found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas."
