    "intro": "Schizocodon, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped stems that give it its common name. The plant typically has opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Schizocodon produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
