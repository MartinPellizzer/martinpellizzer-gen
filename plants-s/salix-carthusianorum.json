    "intro": "Salix carthusianorum, commonly known as the Carthusian willow, is a species of willow native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along riverbanks and wetlands. The plant is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Its flowers are catkins, which are typically green and inconspicuous, and it produces small, woody fruits. The Carthusian willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and its historical use in traditional medicine."
