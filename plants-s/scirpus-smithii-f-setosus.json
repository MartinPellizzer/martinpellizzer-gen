    "intro": "Scirpus smithii f. setosus, commonly known as the hairy bulrush, is a variant of the bulrush species native to wetland environments in North America. This plant is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, often growing in dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while the inflorescence consists of clusters of small, three-lobed spikelets. The plant produces numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, which are followed by fluffy, seed-filled spikelets that aid in dispersal. Scirpus smithii f. setosus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
