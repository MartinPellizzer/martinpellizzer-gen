    "intro": "Stemmacantha caulescens, commonly known as the slender-stemmed candelabra, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright, branched stem and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or orange. The plant has fibrous roots and is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
