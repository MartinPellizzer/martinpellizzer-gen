It features a low-growing habit with rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its delicate appearance and specialized habitat, it is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
