    "intro": "Selaginella aristata var. obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of scale-like leaves that form a compact, cushion-like structure. The plant produces strobila (spore cones) at the base of the rosette, which contain both microspores and megaspores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or forest floors. This variety is distinguished by its broader, more rounded leaves compared to the typical form of S. aristata."
