These plants are typically small, herbaceous, and often grow in rocky or gravelly habitats. They are characterized by their basal leaves and small, cruciform flowers that are usually white or yellow. Stachyphyllum species are found primarily in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. They play a role in stabilizing soil in their native environments and are sometimes used in horticulture for their ornamental value."
