    "intro": "Sansevieria carnea, commonly known as the red-edge snake plant, is a tropical succulent native to Africa. It features upright, sword-shaped leaves with a striking red margin and a dark green center. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and requires minimal watering. Its thick, fleshy leaves store water, making it highly drought-tolerant. Sansevieria carnea is also noted for its air-purifying qualities, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
