    "intro": "Sarracenia flava var. maxima, commonly known as the yellow trumpet pitcher plant, is a striking carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, vibrant yellow, funnel-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky digestive fluid to trap insects. The plant's pitchers, which can grow up to 20 inches in length, are modified leaves that function as traps. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires ample sunlight for optimal growth. This variety is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique ecological function."
