    "intro": "Saccolabium parvum, commonly known as the small-flowered saccolabium, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically range in color from pale yellow to orange. The plant has small, narrow leaves and is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Saccolabium parvum is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in harsh environments."
