It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes other well-known plants like blueberries and rhododendrons. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that turn red in the fall, and its fragrant, white flowers that appear in clusters. It produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Symplocos robinsonii thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and swampy areas."
