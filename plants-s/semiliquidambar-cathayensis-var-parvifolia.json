    "intro": "Semiliquidambar cathayensis var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved Chinese ironwood, is a rare and ancient tree species native to China. It belongs to the family Fagaceae, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its hard, durable wood. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. It produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, which are an important food source for wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
