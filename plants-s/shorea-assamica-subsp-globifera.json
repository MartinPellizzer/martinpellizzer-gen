It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored heartwood. The species is notable for its rounded, globular fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in lowland rainforests and is valued for its high-quality timber. Due to overexploitation, it is also considered an endangered species."
