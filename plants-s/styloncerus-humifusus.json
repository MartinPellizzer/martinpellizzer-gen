    "intro": "Styloncerus humifusus, commonly known as the flat-headed flower beetle, is a small, elongated beetle belonging to the family Cerambycidae. It is characterized by its distinctive flattened head and elongated body, which are adaptations for its lifestyle. This species is typically found in forested areas, where it feeds on decaying wood and plant material. The beetle's life cycle involves a larval stage that spends several years developing within dead or decaying wood. Its presence is often an indicator of healthy, mature forest ecosystems."
