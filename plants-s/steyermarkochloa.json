    "intro": "Steyermarkochloa, commonly known as the Steyermark's grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. The plants typically have slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. They produce small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Steyermarkochloa species are often found in open woodland and grassland habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of these regions."
