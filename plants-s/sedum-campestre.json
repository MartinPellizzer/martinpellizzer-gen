    "intro": "Sedum campestre, commonly known as common stonecrop, is a perennial succulent plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has thick, water-storing leaves that help it survive in dry, rocky environments. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum campestre is also valued for its ability to prevent soil erosion and its low maintenance requirements."
