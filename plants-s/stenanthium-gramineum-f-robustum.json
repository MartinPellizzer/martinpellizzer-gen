    "intro": "Stenanthium gramineum f. robustum, commonly known as the robust form of the grass-like plantain, is a botanical variant characterized by its more vigorous growth habit compared to the typical form. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is native to the eastern United States, particularly in wetland and marshy environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale green flowers in clusters. It is often found in moist, shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
