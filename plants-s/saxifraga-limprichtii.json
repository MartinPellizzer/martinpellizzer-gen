    "intro": "Saxifraga limprichtii, commonly known as the Tibetan saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Tibet. It is a perennial herb with a compact, cushion-like growth habit, adapted to harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are usually fleshy and succulent, helping it retain moisture in arid conditions. Saxifraga limprichtii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in alpine gardens."
