    "intro": "Salix sitchensis var. congesta, commonly known as Sitka willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of Alaska and western Canada. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and typically have a slightly hairy texture. This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh coastal environments and its role in stabilizing stream banks and providing habitat for wildlife."
