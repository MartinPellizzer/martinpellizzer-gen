    "intro": "Saussurea squarrosa, commonly known as the Alpine gumweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine meadows. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in poor, well-drained soils. Saussurea squarrosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
