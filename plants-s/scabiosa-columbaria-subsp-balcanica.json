It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright stems covered in soft, gray-green foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in grassy slopes and rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
