It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and its distinctive red-brown stems that become more pronounced with age. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. This plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands."
