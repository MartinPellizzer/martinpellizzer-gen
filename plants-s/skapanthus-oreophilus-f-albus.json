    "intro": "Skapanthus oreophilus f. albus, commonly known as the white-flowered skapanthus, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late winter to early spring, producing a showy display that attracts pollinators such as moths and bees. Its foliage consists of strap-like, dark green leaves that are evergreen and persist throughout the year. Due to its limited natural habitat and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
