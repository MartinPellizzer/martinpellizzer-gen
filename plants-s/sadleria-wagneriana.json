    "intro": "Sadleria wagneriana, commonly known as Wagner's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grasses, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually green or brown, and it is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Sadleria wagneriana is also valued for its ornamental appeal in water gardens and bog landscapes."
