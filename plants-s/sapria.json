    "intro": "Sapria, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its unique, often fragrant, and showy flowers that can resemble other plants, a trait known as mimicry. The plants typically have opposite, simple leaves and produce small, fleshy fruits. Sapria species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in shaded, moist environments. Their botanical features make them interesting subjects for ecological and evolutionary studies."
