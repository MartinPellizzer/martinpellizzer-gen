    "intro": "Sclerocactus erectocentrus, commonly known as the upright centery, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its spines are relatively short and dense, providing protection from herbivores. Sclerocactus erectocentrus is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
