    "intro": "Sapindus mukorossi, commonly known as the soapberry tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, hairy fruits that turn from green to red as they mature. The seeds inside the fruits are encased in a fleshy, sticky aril, which is often used in traditional medicine. The tree is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its use in ornamental gardening."
