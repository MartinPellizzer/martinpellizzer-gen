    "intro": "Solanum kulliwaita, commonly known as the Kulliwaita nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes many economically important species such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers are usually white or pale purple, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans. Due to its toxicity and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
