    "intro": "Seriphium squarrosum, commonly known as the rough hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its leaves are covered in fine, bristly hairs, giving it a rough texture. The bright yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
