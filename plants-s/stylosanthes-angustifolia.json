    "intro": "Stylosanthes angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf stylo, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its narrow, trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds, which are often used as forage for livestock. Stylosanthes angustifolia is well adapted to poor soils and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it valuable in sustainable agriculture. Its drought tolerance and rapid growth make it a useful plant for soil stabilization and land rehabilitation."
