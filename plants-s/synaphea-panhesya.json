    "intro": "Synaphea panhesya, commonly known as the giant rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in rocky, alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are succulent and adapted to retain moisture in the dry, high-altitude climate. Synaphea panhesya is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
