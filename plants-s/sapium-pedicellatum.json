    "intro": "Sapium pedicellatum, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, inflated, orange-red seed pods that resemble small lanterns, which are a key feature in its common name. These pods contain seeds that are dispersed when they dry and split open. Sapium pedicellatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant, showy fruits."
