It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. Stelis ramonensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
