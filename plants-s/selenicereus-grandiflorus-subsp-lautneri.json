    "intro": "Selenicereus grandiflorus subsp. lautneri, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and is known for its large, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant produces white, tubular flowers with a strong scent, which attract nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The subspecies lautneri is distinguished by its slightly different floral structure and growth habits compared to the main species."
