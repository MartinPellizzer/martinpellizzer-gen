    "intro": "Scirpus maritimus var. monanthos, commonly known as the coastal bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, typically with only a single spikelet, giving it its specific name \"monanthos.\" Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form extensive colonies in wetland and salt marsh environments. Scirpus maritimus var. monanthos plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
