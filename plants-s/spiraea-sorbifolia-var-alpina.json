    "intro": "Spiraea sorbifolia var. alpina, commonly known as alpine spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it forms dense, compact growth. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early summer. Its compact form and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it a hardy ornamental plant. It is valued in horticulture for its resilience and aesthetic appeal in garden settings."
