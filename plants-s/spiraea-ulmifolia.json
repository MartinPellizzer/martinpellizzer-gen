    "intro": "Spiraea ulmifolia, commonly known as the sweet shrub, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, wiry stems. Its leaves are elliptical, serrated, and turn yellow in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. Spiraea ulmifolia is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and long-lasting floral display."
