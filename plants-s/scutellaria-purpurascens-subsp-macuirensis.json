    "intro": "Scutellaria purpurascens subsp. macuirensis, commonly known as the Macuirensis blueweed, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its square, hairy stems and small, two-lipped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in its native habitat."
