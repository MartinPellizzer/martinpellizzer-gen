    "intro": "Spergula grandis, commonly known as the greater sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, ditches, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, triangular stems that are often slightly hairy, and its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and arranged in a rosette at the base. Spergula grandis produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in spike-like clusters during the summer months. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native wetland habitats."
