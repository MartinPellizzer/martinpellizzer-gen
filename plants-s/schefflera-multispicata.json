    "intro": "Schefflera multispicata, commonly known as the umbrella tree, is a member of the Araliaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. Schefflera multispicata is a popular indoor plant due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. It is also valued for its air-purifying properties and ornamental appeal."
