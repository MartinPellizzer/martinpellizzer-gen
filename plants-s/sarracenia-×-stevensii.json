    "intro": "Sarracenia \u00d7 stevensii, commonly known as the hybrid pitcher plant, is a fascinating carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a hybrid between Sarracenia leucophylla and Sarracenia rubra, resulting in a plant with unique characteristics that combine traits from both parents. The plant produces striking, tubular pitchers that secrete a sticky digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. Its foliage is typically bright red or orange, with a hairy interior that aids in trapping prey. Sarracenia \u00d7 stevensii thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
