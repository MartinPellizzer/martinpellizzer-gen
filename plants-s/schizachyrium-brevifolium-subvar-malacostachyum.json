It typically grows in dry to mesic prairies and is adapted to full sun conditions. The plant has a clump-forming habit and produces small, spike-like clusters of pale blue to silver flowers in late summer. It is well-known for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils. This grass is often used in native plant landscaping due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
