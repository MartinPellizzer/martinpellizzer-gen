It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in late winter to early spring, which are highly attractive to pollinators. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and sandy woods. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a valuable species for native plant gardens and conservation efforts."
