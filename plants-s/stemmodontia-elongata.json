    "intro": "Stemmodontia elongata, commonly known as the slender-stemmed toothplant, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly rough texture. Stemmodontia elongata is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
