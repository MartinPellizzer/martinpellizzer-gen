    "intro": "Stellaria davidi var. sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessileleaf starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. The leaves are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk, and are often lance-shaped. This variety is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
