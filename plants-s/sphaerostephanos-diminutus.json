    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos diminutus, commonly known as the dwarf star-step plant, is a unique species belonging to the family Gesneriaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and small, clustered leaves that give it a dense, shrub-like appearance. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the warmer months. Native to the mountainous regions of South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
