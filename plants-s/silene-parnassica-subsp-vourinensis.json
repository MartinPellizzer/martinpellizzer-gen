    "intro": "Silene parnassica subsp. vourinensis, commonly known as the Vourin's catchfly, is a rare and endemic flowering plant found primarily in the Carpathian Mountains. It is a herbaceous perennial with slender stems and small, pinkish to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a distinctive inflorescence with clustered flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
