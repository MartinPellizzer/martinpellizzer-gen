    "intro": "Spathelia excelsa, commonly known as the tall spathelia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers that are clustered in a spathaceous inflorescence, giving it its genus name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Spathelia excelsa is considered a rare and endangered species."
