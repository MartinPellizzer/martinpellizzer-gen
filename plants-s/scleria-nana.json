    "intro": "Scleria nana, commonly known as dwarf bulrush, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flower heads. The plant produces white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist soils. Scleria nana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
