    "intro": "Strychnos tarapotensis, commonly known as the Malabar nut, is a flowering plant belonging to the Loganiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly India and Sri Lanka. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. The seeds within the fruit are encased in a fleshy, orange-red aril, which is often used in traditional medicine. However, the plant contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with caution."
