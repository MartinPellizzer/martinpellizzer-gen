    "intro": "Salix caspica f. pruinosa, commonly known as the Pruinose Cottonwood, is a shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lanceolate leaves that are covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by cylindrical, woody fruits. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to tolerate saline soils. This form is a natural variant of Salix caspica, showing distinct morphological differences from the typical species."
