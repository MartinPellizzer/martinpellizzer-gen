    "intro": "Solanum nigrum var. induratum, commonly known as the rough black nightshade, is a variant of the black nightshade species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which give it a rough texture. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas. Its botanical features make it easily identifiable, though caution is necessary due to its poisonous nature."
