    "intro": "Sonneratia acida, commonly known as the sour apple mangrove, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is native to tropical regions of Asia. The plant has prop roots that help stabilize soil and facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged conditions. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a sour taste due to high concentrations of organic acids. It plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
