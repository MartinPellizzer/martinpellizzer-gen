    "intro": "Salix decumbens, commonly known as the creeping willow, is a low-growing shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its prostrate or decumbent stems that often form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and have a slightly hairy texture. Salix decumbens thrives in moist, temperate environments and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks."
