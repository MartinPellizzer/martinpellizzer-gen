    "intro": "Salix exigua var. luteosericea, commonly known as the yellow silky willow, is a variant of the narrow-leaved willow native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and delicate, yellowish-green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streams, rivers, and wet meadows. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, and it is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its graceful appearance. The species is also valued for its role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
