    "intro": "Salix cuspidata, commonly known as the Japanese weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a graceful appearance. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth margin and a silvery underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and along water features."
