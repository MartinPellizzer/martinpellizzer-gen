    "intro": "Silphium pinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf compass plant, is a flowering plant native to the Great Plains of North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and leaves that are pinnately divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in prairies and along roadsides. Silphium pinnatifidum is also valued for its historical use by Indigenous peoples for medicinal and practical purposes."
