    "intro": "Silene linearis, commonly known as the linear catchfly, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and clusters of small, pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Silene linearis is a herbaceous perennial that blooms from late spring to early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
