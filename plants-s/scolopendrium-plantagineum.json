    "intro": "Scolopendrium plantagineum, commonly known as the creeping fern or the common scolopendria, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Pteridaceae. It is native to parts of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that produce clusters of small, bright green, triangular-shaped leaves. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, serrated appearance, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves. Scolopendrium plantagineum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to form dense, ground-covering mats."
