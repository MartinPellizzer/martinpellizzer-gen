It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Senna acclinis is often found in coastal areas and sandy soils, where it thrives in well-drained conditions. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods and are used in traditional medicine in some regions."
