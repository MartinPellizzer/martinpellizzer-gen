    "intro": "Selaginella tropidophora, commonly known as the tropical spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, herbaceous structure. It features a distinct stem with spirally arranged leaves that are typically linear and pointed. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate cones, a feature typical of many spore-bearing plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology and reproductive strategy make it an important species in the study of ancient plant lineages."
