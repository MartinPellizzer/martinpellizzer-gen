It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizome is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The unique structure of its fronds and the way it clusters together make it a distinctive addition to botanical collections."
