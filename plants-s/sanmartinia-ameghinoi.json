    "intro": "Sanmartinia ameghinoi, commonly known as the Ameghino's sanmartinia, is a rare and endangered species native to the Andean region of South America. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep red. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in cloud forest habitats. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
