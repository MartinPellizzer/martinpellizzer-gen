    "intro": "Striga asiatica var. humilis, commonly known as witchweed, is a parasitic plant that primarily infests cereal crops such as maize, sorghum, and millet. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, attaching itself via haustoria to the vascular system of the host plant. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short, erect stem with alternate leaves. It is native to Africa and thrives in warm, dry climates, often becoming a significant agricultural pest. Its life cycle involves seed germination triggered by chemical signals from the host plant, making it a challenging weed to control."
