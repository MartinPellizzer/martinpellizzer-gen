    "intro": "Semecarpus neocaledonicus, commonly known as the New Caledonia sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing one or two seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
