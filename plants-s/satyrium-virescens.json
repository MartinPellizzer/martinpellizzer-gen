    "intro": "Satyrium virescens, commonly known as the green-tailed orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the high-altitude conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
