    "intro": "Sarcobatus retusus, commonly known as the slender glassworts, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, jointed stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces tiny, green to reddish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in coastal dunes, salt marshes, and other harsh, coastal habitats. Sarcobatus retusus plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
