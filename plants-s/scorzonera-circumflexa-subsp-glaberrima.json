    "intro": "Scorzonera circumflexa subsp. glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous scorzonera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and tall, branched stems. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, which are often borne in clusters at the top of the stems. Its root system is thick and fleshy, which helps it survive in dry conditions. Scorzonera circumflexa subsp. glaberrima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
