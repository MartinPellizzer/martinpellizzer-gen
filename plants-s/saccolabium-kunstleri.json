    "intro": "Saccolabium kunstleri, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and has a deep root system to access underground water. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic if ingested, making it a plant with both ecological and potential medicinal significance."
