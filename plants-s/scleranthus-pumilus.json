    "intro": "Scleranthus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf thornweed, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are usually arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse its seeds by wind. Scleranthus pumilus is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to thrive in temperate climates."
