    "intro": "Sonchus gramineus, commonly known as common sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of smooth, bluish-green leaves that are typically spoon-shaped or elongated. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are followed by spiky, bristly fruits. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
