    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 vollmannii, commonly known as the Weeping willow hybrid, is a deciduous tree or shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading appearance, giving it a distinctive and elegant look. The plant produces catkins as its flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated, and its leaves are simple, alternate, and often heart-shaped. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and lakes. The bark is smooth and gray, with a fibrous texture that becomes more rugged as the tree matures."
