    "intro": "Selaginella hachijoense, commonly known as the Hachijo clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is native to Japan, specifically the island of Hachijo-jima, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant exhibits a distinctive creeping growth habit with small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls along its stems. It produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, typical of its evolutionary lineage. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
