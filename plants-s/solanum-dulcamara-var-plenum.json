    "intro": "Solanum dulcamara var. plenum, commonly known as the full-blown woody nightshade, is a perennial vine native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range from white to violet in color. The plant produces berries that transition from green to red or yellow as they mature, often containing toxic alkaloids. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found along fences, walls, or in woodland areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
