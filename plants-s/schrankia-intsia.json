    "intro": "Schrankia intsia, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued for its scent and durability. The tree has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically yellow or greenish, and it produces small, round fruits with a single seed. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Schrankia intsia is considered endangered in many parts of its native range."
