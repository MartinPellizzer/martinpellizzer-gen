It features a dense mat of fleshy, dark green leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
