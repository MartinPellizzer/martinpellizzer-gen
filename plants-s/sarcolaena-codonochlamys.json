    "intro": "Sarcolaena codonochlamys, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a contrasting red or purple throat. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found along the coastlines where it is exposed to salt spray. Sarcolaena codonochlamys is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
