    "intro": "Spiranthes weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's spiral orchid, is a species of orchid native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, spiraling arrangement of flowers along a single stem, which is a distinctive feature of the Spiranthes genus. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing small, white to pale pink flowers that are often fragrant. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. The orchid is pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, relying on its floral structure to attract and facilitate pollination."
