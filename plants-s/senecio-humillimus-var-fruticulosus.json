    "intro": "Senecio humillimus var. fruticulosus, commonly known as the creeping groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant landscapes."
