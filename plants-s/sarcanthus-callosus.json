It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, ribbed stems and clustered, small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats. Sarcanthus callosus is adapted to full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping."
