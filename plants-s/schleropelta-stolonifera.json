    "intro": "Schleropelta stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping rock fern, is a perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively along the ground. The plant produces small, shield-shaped leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Schleropelta stolonifera is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in rocky areas."
