    "intro": "Serapias \u00d7 wettsteinii nothosubsp. wettsteinii, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Serapias acaulis and Serapias wettsteinii. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in wet meadows and marshy areas. The plant produces strikingly colored flowers, typically in shades of yellow and orange, with a distinctive hooded structure. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
