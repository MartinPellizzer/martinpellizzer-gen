    "intro": "Staurostigma concinnum f. lineolatum, commonly known as the spotted starwort, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
