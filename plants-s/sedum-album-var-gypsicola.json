    "intro": "Sedum album var. gypsicola, commonly known as the gypsum sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils, often found on rocky or gypsum-rich substrates. This variety is valued for its low maintenance and ability to thrive in harsh environments."
