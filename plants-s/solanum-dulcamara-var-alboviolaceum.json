    "intro": "Solanum dulcamara var. alboviolaceum, commonly known as the white-violet bindweed, is a variant of the common woody nightshade. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The flowers are typically white or pale violet, with a distinctive five-lobed corolla that blooms in late summer. This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded areas along stream banks and in woodlands. It contains toxic alkaloids and is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
