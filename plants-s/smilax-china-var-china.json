    "intro": "Smilax china var. china, commonly known as Chinese smilax, is a perennial climbing shrub native to eastern Asia. It features a robust, woody stem with thorny nodes and is characterized by its compound leaves that are usually trifoliate. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense thickets."
