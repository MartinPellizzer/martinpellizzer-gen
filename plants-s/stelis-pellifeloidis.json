    "intro": "Stelis pellifeloidis, commonly known as the pellifeloidis orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a slender, wiry stem with a few leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Stelis pellifeloidis is valued for its unique floral structure and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
