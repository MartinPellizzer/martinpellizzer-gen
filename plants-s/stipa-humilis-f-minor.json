    "intro": "Stipa humilis f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf basketgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It features slender, tufted stems that are typically less than 30 cm in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are often pale green to reddish in color. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in poor soils. This grass is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
