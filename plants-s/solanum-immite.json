    "intro": "Solanum immite, commonly known as the African nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe, containing toxic seeds. Solanum immite is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils, and it has adapted to thrive in arid environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by livestock and humans."
