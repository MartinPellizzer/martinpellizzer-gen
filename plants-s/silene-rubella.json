    "intro": "Silene rubella, commonly known as the red-stemmed catchfly, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, reddish stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Silene rubella is an important plant for pollinators and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
