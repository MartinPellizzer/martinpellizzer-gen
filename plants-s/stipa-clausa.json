    "intro": "Stipa clausa, commonly known as the closed tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are often wind-pollinated. Stipa clausa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
