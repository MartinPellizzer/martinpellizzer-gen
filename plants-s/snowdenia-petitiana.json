    "intro": "Snowdenia petitiana, commonly known as the dwarf snowdonia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Wales. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle beauty to its alpine habitat. Snowdenia petitiana thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a cool, sheltered environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
