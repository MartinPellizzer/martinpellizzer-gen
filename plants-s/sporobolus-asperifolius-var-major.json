    "intro": "Sporobolus asperifolius var. major, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, gray-green leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It has adapted to thrive in poor soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species."
