    "intro": "Sciaphila major, commonly known as the giant sunshade, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on the trunks of trees in the understory of dense forests. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in low-light conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pale green, and it produces fruit that is edible for certain bird species. Sciaphila major plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food and shelter for various organisms."
