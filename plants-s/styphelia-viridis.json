    "intro": "Styphelia viridis, commonly known as the green whorled greenbulb, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeastern Australia. It features small, needle-like leaves that are clustered in whorls around the stems, giving it a compact and dense appearance. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate floral display to its foliage. Styphelia viridis is well adapted to sandy soils and salty sea air, making it a hardy plant in coastal environments. Its botanical characteristics make it a unique and resilient member of the Ericaceae family."
