    "intro": "Saxifraga pilosa, commonly known as the stonecrop or moss campion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, usually blooming in early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or woodland habitats. Saxifraga pilosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
