    "intro": "Salix acuminata var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its compact form, with short, flexible stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in cold climates as an ornamental plant."
