    "intro": "Salix propitia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and streams. Salix propitia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in basket-making and as a source of flexible wood."
