    "intro": "Sideroxylon schwackei, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard, and heavy wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant has simple, opposite, and often elliptical leaves that are usually dark green in color. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Sideroxylon schwackei is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
