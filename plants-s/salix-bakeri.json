    "intro": "Salix bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's willow, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
