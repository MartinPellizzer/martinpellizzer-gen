    "intro": "Suaeda pelagica, commonly known as sea blite, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments, often found in salt marshes and coastal dunes. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding its survival in arid and salty conditions. Its small, greenish-white flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Suaeda pelagica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
