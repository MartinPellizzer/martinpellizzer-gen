    "intro": "Sphaeropteris bradei, commonly known as the Brade's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the family Cycadaceae. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are typically a deep green in color. Native to the Philippines, this cycad is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, and its reproductive structures are typically separate, with male and female cones on different plants. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Sphaeropteris bradei is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
