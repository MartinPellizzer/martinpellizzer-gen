    "intro": "Salix depressa var. microphyla, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and flexible, often\u530d\u5310 (prostrate) growth habit. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or alpine environments. Its flowers are catkins, which are pollinated by wind, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This species is notable for its resilience to cold climates and its role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
