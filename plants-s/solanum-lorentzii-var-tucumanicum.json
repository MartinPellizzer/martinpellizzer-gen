    "intro": "Solanum lorentzii var. tucumanicum, commonly known as the Tucum\u00e1n nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by berries that mature to a dark purple color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or semi-arid environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but is of interest in botanical and ecological studies."
