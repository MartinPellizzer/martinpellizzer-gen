    "intro": "Secale ancestrale var. arenosum, commonly known as the sand rye, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale yellow flowers, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland dunes. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize sand dunes, it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
