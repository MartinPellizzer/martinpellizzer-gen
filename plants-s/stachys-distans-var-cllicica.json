    "intro": "Stachys distans var. cllicica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved betony, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features upright stems that are often hairy, bearing opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces spikes of pale blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting flowers."
