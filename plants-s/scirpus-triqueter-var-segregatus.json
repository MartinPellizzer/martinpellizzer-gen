    "intro": "Scirpus triqueter var. segregatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, clustered spikes of greenish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a distinct three-angled cross-section. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic life."
