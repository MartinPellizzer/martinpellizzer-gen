    "intro": "Selago coccinea, commonly known as the red sandalwood or red selago, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Selago coccinea is valued for its ornamental beauty and has some traditional uses in local communities."
