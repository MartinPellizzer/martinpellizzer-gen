It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like clusters of leaflets, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are typically glossy and dark green, with a leathery texture. Schefflera manus-dei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
