    "intro": "Santalum album, commonly known as Indian sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to India, Australia, and other parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its fragrance and medicinal properties. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The tree is also known for its slow growth and is often cultivated for its essential oils and timber."
