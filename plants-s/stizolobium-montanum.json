    "intro": "Stizolobium montanum, commonly known as the mountain legume, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America and northern South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant features compound leaves with pinnate arrangement and produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically yellow or white in color. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. Stizolobium montanum is often found in dry or semi-arid habitats and is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and biodiversity support."
