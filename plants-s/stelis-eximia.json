    "intro": "Stelis eximia, commonly known as the Elegant Stelis, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the wet season. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis eximia is valued in horticulture for its beauty and adaptability to various growing conditions."
