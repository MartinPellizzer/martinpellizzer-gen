    "intro": "Schoenobiblus suffruticosa, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub-like perennial that produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant has adapted to harsh, dry environments with a deep root system and small, waxy leaves to reduce water loss. Its flowers bloom in the spring and are pollinated by insects, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
