    "intro": "Saxifraga sphaeradena subsp. dhwojii, commonly known as the Himalayan saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and compact, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
