It is a vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Its leaves are typically elongated and have a distinct, spiky appearance, contributing to its common name. Selaginella longispicata is also noted for its ability to survive in arid conditions, making it a resilient species in various ecological settings."
