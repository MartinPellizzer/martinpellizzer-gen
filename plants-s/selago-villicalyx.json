    "intro": "Selago villicalyx, commonly known as the silverleaf selago, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a delicate floral display to its habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, and the stems are often woody and branched. Selago villicalyx is well adapted to harsh, sun-exposed environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
