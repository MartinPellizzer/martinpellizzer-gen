    "intro": "Solanum adventitium, commonly known as the adventitious solanum, is a species within the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves, which are typically green with a slightly pubescent texture. The plant produces small, white to violet flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that range in color from yellow to red. It is native to certain regions of South America and thrives in warm, humid climates. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native habitats."
