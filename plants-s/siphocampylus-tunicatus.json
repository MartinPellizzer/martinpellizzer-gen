    "intro": "Siphocampylus tunicatus, commonly known as the woolly bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are inflated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Siphocampylus tunicatus thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
