It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, and its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer.
