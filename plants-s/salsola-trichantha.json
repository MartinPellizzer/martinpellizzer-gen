    "intro": "Salsola trichantha, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia and the Mediterranean region. It is an annual or biennial plant characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is well adapted to arid and saline environments, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. It produces a large number of seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in new regions. Salsola trichantha is often found in dry fields, roadsides, and other disturbed habitats."
