    "intro": "Solanum asperolanatum, commonly known as the rough nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and small, clustered flowers that range from white to purple. Its fruit is a fleshy berry that turns from green to yellow or red as it matures. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas."
