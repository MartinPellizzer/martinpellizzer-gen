    "intro": "Stylocoryna coriacea, commonly known as the rough-stemmed stylocoryna, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its woody, often fissured stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a rough, leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Stylocoryna coriacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
