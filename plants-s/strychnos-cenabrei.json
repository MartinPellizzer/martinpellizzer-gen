    "intro": "Strychnos cenabrei, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by distinctive, winged fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The tree is often found in lowland and hill forest areas, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates."
