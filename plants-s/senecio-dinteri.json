It is a low-growing perennial herb with narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
