    "intro": "Saxifraga aizoon subvar. subaffinis, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to rocky and alpine environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in crevices and on rocky outcrops, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are densely packed and often covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with five petals and numerous stamens, arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, demonstrating resilience to cold temperatures and strong winds."
