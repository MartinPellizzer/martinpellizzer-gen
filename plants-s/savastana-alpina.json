    "intro": "Savastana alpina, commonly known as the alpine savastana, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in arid mountain conditions. Savastana alpina is often found in alpine meadows and is a symbol of resilience in harsh environments."
