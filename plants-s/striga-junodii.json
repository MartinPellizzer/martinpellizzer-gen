    "intro": "Striga junodii, commonly known as the African witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, often causing significant damage to crops like sorghum and millet. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short, erect stem with numerous branches. Its seeds are dispersed by wind and can remain viable in the soil for years, making it a persistent agricultural pest. Due to its parasitic nature and impact on food security, Striga junodii is a subject of ongoing research for control methods."
