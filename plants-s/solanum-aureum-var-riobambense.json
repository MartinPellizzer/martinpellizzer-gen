    "intro": "Solanum aureum var. riobambense, commonly known as the golden nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in umbels, often blooming in late summer to early autumn. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that mature to a vibrant red color, though they are toxic and should not be consumed. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage and floral display."
