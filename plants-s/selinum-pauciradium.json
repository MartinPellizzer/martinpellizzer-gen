    "intro": "Selinum pauciradium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wormwood, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
