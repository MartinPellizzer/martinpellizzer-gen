    "intro": "Salvia lavanduloides var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf blue sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features aromatic, gray-green leaves that are broader than those of the typical *Salvia lavanduloides* and are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking spikes of violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is widely cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
