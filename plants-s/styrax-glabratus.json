    "intro": "Styrax glabratus, commonly known as the smooth styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white, waxy flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, red, berry-like fruits. Styrax glabratus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil. It is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic resins."
