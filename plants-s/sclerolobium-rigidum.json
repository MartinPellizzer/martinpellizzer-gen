    "intro": "Sclerolobium rigidum, commonly known as the rigid acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Sclerolobium rigidum is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its hardy nature in landscaping."
