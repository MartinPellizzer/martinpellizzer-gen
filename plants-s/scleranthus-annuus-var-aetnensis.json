    "intro": "Scleranthus annuus var. aetnensis, commonly known as the Sicilian thornweed, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of Sicily. It is a herbaceous annual species characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
