    "intro": "Stipa debilis var. papillosa, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
