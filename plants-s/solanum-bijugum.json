    "intro": "Solanum bijugum, commonly known as the twinleaf nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically features opposite, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale green. Its berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic compounds, making them dangerous if consumed in large quantities. Solanum bijugum is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests or along stream banks."
