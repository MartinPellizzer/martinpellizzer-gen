    "intro": "Solanum buchtienii, commonly known as the Buchtien's nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems, oval-shaped leaves, and small, star-shaped white or purple flowers. It produces berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature, though they are toxic and not edible. Solanum buchtienii is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions."
