    "intro": "Satyrium conopseum, commonly known as the yellow-tipped orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa. It typically grows in grasslands and rocky outcrops, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features a slender, branching stem with numerous small, greenish-yellow flowers that have distinctive yellow tips. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the dry environment. The orchid is pollinated primarily by bees, which are attracted to its nectar-rich flowers."
