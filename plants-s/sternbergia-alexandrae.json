    "intro": "Sternbergia alexandrae, commonly known as the Armenian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its bulbs are adapted to survive harsh winters, and it blooms in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
