It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its bright yellow flower heads and distinctive, hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, calcareous soils and is adapted to the harsh, alpine conditions of its habitat. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native region."
