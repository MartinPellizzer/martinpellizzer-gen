    "intro": "Salix lasiandra var. lyallii, commonly known as Lyall's willow, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkin-like flowers, which are clustered in small, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in streamside habitats. This variety is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to other willow species."
