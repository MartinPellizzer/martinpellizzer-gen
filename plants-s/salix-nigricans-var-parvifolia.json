    "intro": "Salix nigricans var. parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and wetlands. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
