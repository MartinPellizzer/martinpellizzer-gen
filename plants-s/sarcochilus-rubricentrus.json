    "intro": "Sarcochilus rubricentrus, commonly known as the red-centred saxifrage, is a terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand. It features a compact, hairy rhizome with a rosette of broad, leathery leaves that are typically green with reddish veins. The plant produces showy, red-brown flowers with a distinctive yellow lip, which bloom from late winter to early spring. It thrives in damp, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
