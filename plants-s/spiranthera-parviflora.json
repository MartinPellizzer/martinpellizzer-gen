It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters, featuring multiple stems covered in dense, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers arranged in spiraled clusters, which give it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
