    "intro": "Schefflera tenuis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound, pinnate leaves that are narrow and elongated, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Schefflera tenuis thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
