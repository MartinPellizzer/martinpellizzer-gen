    "intro": "Silene montserratii subsp. crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaved campion, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its robust, succulent leaves and showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy slopes, adapting to harsh, sunny conditions. Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in morphology compared to other Silene species. It is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
