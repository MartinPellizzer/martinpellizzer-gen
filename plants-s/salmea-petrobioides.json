    "intro": "Salmea petrobioides, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments in southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand periods of drought. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Salmea petrobioides plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and provides nectar for pollinators."
