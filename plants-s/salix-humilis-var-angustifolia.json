    "intro": "Salix humilis var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. The plant features slender, angular stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. The leaves and branches are used in traditional herbal remedies and are also valued for their ecological benefits in stabilizing riverbanks."
