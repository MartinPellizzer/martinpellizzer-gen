    "intro": "Schoenoplectus lacustris f. confertus, commonly known as the broad-leaved bulrush, is a wetland plant characterized by its robust, grass-like foliage. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes, lake edges, and wet meadows. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are broad and flat, often reaching several inches in length, and are arranged in a fan-like pattern at the base. This form is a naturally occurring variant of the species, distinguished by its more compact and broader leaf structure compared to the typical form."
