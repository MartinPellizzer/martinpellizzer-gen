    "intro": "Sedum alsinifolium, commonly known as the mossy stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fleshy, often blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions with minimal care."
