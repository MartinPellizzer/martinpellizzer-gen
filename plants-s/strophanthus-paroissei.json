    "intro": "Strophanthus paroissei, commonly known as the African milkvine, is a climbing shrub native to southern Africa. It features woody stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is known for its toxic properties due to the presence of cardiac glycosides. Strophanthus paroissei is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine."
