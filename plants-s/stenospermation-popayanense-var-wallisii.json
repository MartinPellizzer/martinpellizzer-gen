    "intro": "Stenospermation popayanense var. wallisii, commonly known as the Popayan orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
