    "intro": "Sapindus cuspidatus, commonly known as the Chinese soapnut, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that encase a cluster of seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a natural detergent. Its bark and leaves contain saponins, giving it its soap-like properties and making it valuable in both ecological and practical contexts."
