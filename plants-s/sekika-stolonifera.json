    "intro": "Sekika stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping grass or stoloniferous grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its horizontal stolons that root at the nodes. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as meadows and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in spikes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread efficiently and form dense mats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil."
