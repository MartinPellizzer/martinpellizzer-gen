    "intro": "Scorzonera alba, commonly known as white scorzonera, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces showy white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, often with a central disc of smaller florets. Scorzonera alba is typically found in meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though it is primarily appreciated for its ornamental value."
