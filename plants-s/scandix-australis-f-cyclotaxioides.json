    "intro": "Scandix australis f. cyclotaxioides, commonly known as the cyclocyclic scandix, is a rare botanical variant native to southern regions of Australia. It is characterized by its unique leaf structure, featuring a distinctive arrangement of lobes that form a near-circular pattern. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with dense foliage, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring, producing small, clustered white flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
