    "intro": "Sesuvium humifusum, commonly known as rock saltbush, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and arid environments. It thrives in coastal areas and salt marshes, where it tolerates high levels of soil salinity. The plant has prostrate growth habits, with fleshy, succulent leaves that store water. Its small, pink to purple flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Sesuvium humifusum plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
