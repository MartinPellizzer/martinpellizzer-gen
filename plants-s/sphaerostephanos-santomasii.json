    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos santomasii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its star-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
