    "intro": "Stachys heldreichii, commonly known as the Balkan hedge-nettle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or violet, arranged in whorls along the stem. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
