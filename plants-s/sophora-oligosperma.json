    "intro": "Sophora oligosperma, commonly known as the Chinese wisteria, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces striking clusters of fragrant, pea-like flowers that bloom in the spring. Its seeds are encased in elongated, woody pods that split open to release the seeds. Sophora oligosperma is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional Chinese medicine."
