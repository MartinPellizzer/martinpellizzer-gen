    "intro": "Sonchus eryngiifolius, commonly known as the thistle-leaved sowthistle, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that resemble those of thistles. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. Sonchus eryngiifolius is often found in disturbed soils and can become a weed in agricultural settings."
