    "intro": "Silene incompta, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada ghostflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a flowering plant in the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its pale pink to white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a short, hairy stem and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cold, dry conditions of its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Silene incompta is considered an endangered species."
