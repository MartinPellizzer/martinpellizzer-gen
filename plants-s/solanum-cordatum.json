    "intro": "Solanum cordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces berries that start green and ripen to a bright red, containing toxic alkaloids. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shady areas. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
