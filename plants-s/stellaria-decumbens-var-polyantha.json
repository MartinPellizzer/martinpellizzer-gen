It features prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetland environments."
