    "intro": "Smilax herbacea, commonly known as the creeping smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It features woody stems that are often thorny and can spread across the ground or climb over other vegetation. The plant has compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits. Smilax herbacea is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its persistent foliage and ability to thrive in low-light conditions make it a notable component of native plant communities."
