    "intro": "Scirpus renschii, commonly known as the Rensch's bulrush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a tall, robust perennial herb that typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in aquatic environments. Scirpus renschii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and support diverse wildlife."
