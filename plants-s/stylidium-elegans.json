It is a small, terrestrial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal or heathland environments. The plant features a slender, branching stem with showy, yellowish-green flowers that are adorned with intricate patterns. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, particularly flies and beetles, due to their unique coloration and scent. Stylidium elegans is known for its ability to thrive in arid conditions, making it a resilient and adaptable species."
