It belongs to the family Pennatulaceae and is characterized by its branching, fan-like structure made of calcium carbonate. The plant exhibits a vibrant green color due to the presence of symbiotic algae within its tissues. It thrives in shallow waters with moderate currents and requires clear, warm water for optimal growth. Stylophyllum virens plays a vital role in reef ecosystems by providing habitat and shelter for various marine organisms."
