    "intro": "Saxifraga ciliatopetala, commonly known as the fringed-petaled saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of ovate, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, ciliate margins. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers with five notched petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in its native range."
