    "intro": "Scutellaria rupestris subsp. rechingeri, commonly known as the rock skullcup, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in dry, sunny habitats such as cliffs and slopes. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves and produces tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a desirable plant for rock gardens and alpine collections. It is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its efficacy."
