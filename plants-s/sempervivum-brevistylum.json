    "intro": "Sempervivum brevistylum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the Pyrenees and parts of southern France. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and fleshy, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Sempervivum brevistylum is also known for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil."
