    "intro": "Salvadora wightiana, commonly known as Indian toothbrush, is a deciduous shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of India and Pakistan. It belongs to the family Salicaceae and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits containing several seeds. Salvadora wightiana is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil and low rainfall environments. It is often used in traditional medicine for its astringent and antiseptic properties."
