It features slender, ascending stems with opposite, linear to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Its flowers are typically tubular with five lobes, and it blooms from late spring to early summer.
