    "intro": "Saxifraga trigyna, commonly known as the three-lobed saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suited to rocky or gravelly terrain. Saxifraga trigyna is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
