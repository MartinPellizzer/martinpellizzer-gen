It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native habitat. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution."
