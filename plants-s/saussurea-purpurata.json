    "intro": "Saussurea purpurata, commonly known as the purple gentian, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It features a stout, woody stem with large, showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, dark seeds in its fruit. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
