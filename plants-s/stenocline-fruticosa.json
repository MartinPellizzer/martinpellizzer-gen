    "intro": "Stenocline fruticosa, commonly known as the coastal shrub, is a hardy plant adapted to harsh coastal environments. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in areas with high salt exposure and strong winds. The plant has small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss and salt damage. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. Stenocline fruticosa plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along coastal regions."
