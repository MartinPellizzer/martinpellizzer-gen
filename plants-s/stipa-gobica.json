    "intro": "Stipa gobica, commonly known as the Goebel's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fluffy, silver-gray inflorescences that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as sandy soils, rocky slopes, and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Stipa gobica is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
