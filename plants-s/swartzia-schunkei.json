    "intro": "Swartzia schunkei, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued in the musical instrument industry. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated pods. Swartzia schunkei is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its relatively fast growth rate, making it useful for reforestation efforts. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
