It belongs to the family Soroceaceae and is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and reduced leaves. The plant exhibits a subterranean growth form, with most of its structure hidden beneath the soil surface. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, adapted for pollination by wind or specialized insects. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
