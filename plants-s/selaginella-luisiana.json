    "intro": "Selaginella luisiana, commonly known as the Texas spikemoss, is a member of the spikemoss family (Selaginellaceae). It is a small, evergreen, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a distinctive appearance with upright, spiky stems and small, scale-like leaves. It produces cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the reproductive organs. Selaginella luisiana is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
