    "intro": "Stelis vestita, commonly known as the veiled stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees in tropical rainforests, where it derives moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. Its roots are specialized for absorbing water and nutrients from the surrounding environment. Stelis vestita is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique growth habit."
