    "intro": "Schoenus benthamii, commonly known as the Bentham's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its slender, grass-like stems are often clustered, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes during the spring and summer months. Schoenus benthamii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
