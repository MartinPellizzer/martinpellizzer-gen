    "intro": "Salvia rubescens subsp. rubescens, commonly known as scarlet sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking, tubular red to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant features gray-green, lance-shaped leaves with a fuzzy texture, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds, contributing to its ecological value in native gardens."
