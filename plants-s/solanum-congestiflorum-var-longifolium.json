    "intro": "Solanum congestiflorum var. longifolium, commonly known as the longleaf nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of South America. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinct, slightly serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in late spring to early summer. These flowers give way to small, spherical berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments."
