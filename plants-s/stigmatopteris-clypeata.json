    "intro": "Stigmatopteris clypeata, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Stigmatopteris clypeata plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
