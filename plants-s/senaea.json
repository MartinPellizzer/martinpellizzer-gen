    "intro": "Senaea, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, floating leaves that often have bladders for trapping small aquatic organisms. Senaea species are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. They are carnivorous, using their specialized bladder-like structures to capture and digest prey. The genus includes several species, each adapted to different water conditions and light availability."
