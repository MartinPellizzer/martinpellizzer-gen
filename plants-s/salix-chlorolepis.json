    "intro": "Salix chlorolepis, commonly known as the green-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as riverbanks and wet meadows. The plant features slender, drooping branches and lance-shaped leaves that are usually a vibrant green on both sides. Its flowers are catkin-like, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. Salix chlorolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland areas."
