    "intro": "Sceptridium ternatum var. tenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved clubmoss, is a species of small, evergreen herbaceous plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and its distinctive, spirally arranged, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. This variety is noted for its delicate appearance and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes in shaded gardens."
