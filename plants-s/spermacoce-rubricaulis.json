    "intro": "Spermacoce rubricaulis, commonly known as the red-stemmed starburry, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant has opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are usually elliptic to ovate in shape. Its fruit is a small, two-lobed capsule that splits open to release its seeds. Spermacoce rubricaulis is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
