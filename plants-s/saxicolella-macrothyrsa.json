    "intro": "Saxicolella macrothyrsa, commonly known as the rock-horned lichen, is a member of the Lecanoraceae family. It is a foliose lichen that typically grows on rocky surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a thallus that is closely adherent to the substrate, with a distinctive, branched structure. Its morphology includes a dense, crust-like layer with a central axis and lateral branches. Saxicolella macrothyrsa is known for its slow growth and ability to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions."
