    "intro": "Salix krylovii f. acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaved willow, is a hybrid willow species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are sharply pointed, giving it its common name. The leaves are typically a glossy green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, with a smooth or slightly hairy texture. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This plant is often used in ornamental horticulture for its graceful appearance and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
