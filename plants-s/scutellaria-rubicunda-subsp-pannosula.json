    "intro": "Scutellaria rubicunda subsp. pannosula, commonly known as the red scutellaria, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of violet to purple flowers with a distinctive two-lipped structure typical of the mint family. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The subspecies pannosula is distinguished by its dense, hairy calyces and slightly smaller flowers compared to the main species."
