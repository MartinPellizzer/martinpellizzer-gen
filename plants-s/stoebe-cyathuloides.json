    "intro": "Stoebe cyathuloides, commonly known as clustered devil's-bit scabwort, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered blue or violet flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowering stems are usually shorter than the leaves, and it often grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. Stoebe cyathuloides is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
