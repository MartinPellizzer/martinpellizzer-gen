    "intro": "Smilax subpubescens, commonly known as the prickly nightshade or greenbrier, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are covered in sharp, recurved spines. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy texture. Smilax subpubescens is adapted to a variety of soil types and thrives in partial to full shade, making it a common sight in forest understories."
