    "intro": "Solidago stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaf goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and stream banks. Its narrow, linear leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in the late summer and early fall. Solidago stenophylla plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
