    "intro": "Salix zangica var. tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan willow, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and small, ovate leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of silvery hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and thrives in cold, arid environments. It is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and poor soil conditions. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
