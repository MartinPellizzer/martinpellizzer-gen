    "intro": "Schradera subandina, commonly known as the Andean shrub, is a perennial plant native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming during the cooler months. Schradera subandina is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool, temperate climates. Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of alpine flora and ecological resilience."
