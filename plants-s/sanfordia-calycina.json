    "intro": "Sanfordia calycina, commonly known as the Florida flame flower, is a rare and unique species native to the United States. It is characterized by its striking red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands and swampy areas, thriving in moist, acidic soils. It has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, green berries that mature into dark red fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
