It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its distinctive, showy yellow flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in shrubland or grassland habitats. Senecio ragazzii is an important component of local ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
