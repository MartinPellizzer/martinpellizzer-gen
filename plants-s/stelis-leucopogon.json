    "intro": "Stelis leucopogon, commonly known as the white-lipped stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees in tropical and subtropical rainforests, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant has a slender, unbranched stem and produces small, clustered flowers with white petals and a distinctive yellow lip. Its roots are specialized for attachment and water absorption, and it thrives in high humidity and indirect light. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or shaded gardens."
