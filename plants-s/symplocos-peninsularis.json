    "intro": "Symplocos peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular waxleaf, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its elliptical, glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of wax. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers during the summer months, followed by small, red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
