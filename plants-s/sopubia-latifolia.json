    "intro": "Sopubia latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf sopubia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Sopubia latifolia produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
