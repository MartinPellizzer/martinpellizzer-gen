    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum institum, commonly known as the moonlight fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the shaded understories of tropical rainforests. It possesses elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery coating, which helps reflect excess light and reduce water loss. The plant's rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in moist, nutrient-poor soils. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, a characteristic common among ferns. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Sciodaphyllum institum is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in its natural range."
