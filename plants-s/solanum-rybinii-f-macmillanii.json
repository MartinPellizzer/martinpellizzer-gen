    "intro": "Solanum rybinii f. macmillanii, commonly known as the Macmillan's nightshade, is a unique variant of the nightshade family. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its small, hairy leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans but may serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It is native to specific regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and distinct floral features, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
