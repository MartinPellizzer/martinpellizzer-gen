    "intro": "Saxifraga meridionalis, commonly known as the southern saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small, white or pinkish flowers appear in spring, usually in clusters at the ends of its stems. Saxifraga meridionalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging environments."
