    "intro": "Sedum nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a dense rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its hardy nature, Sedum nelsonii is relatively low maintenance and drought tolerant."
