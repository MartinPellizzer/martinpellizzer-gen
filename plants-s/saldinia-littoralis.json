    "intro": "Saldinia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal saldinia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in dense tufts. Saldinia littoralis is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate moderate levels of coastal erosion."
