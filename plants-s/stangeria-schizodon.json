    "intro": "Stangeria schizodon, commonly known as the Cape York fern, is a unique fern species native to northern Australia and parts of New Guinea. It is characterized by its distinctive, strap-like fronds that are often divided into segments, giving it an unusual appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Stangeria schizodon plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability."
