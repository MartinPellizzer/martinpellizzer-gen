    "intro": "Spergularia modesta proles atheniensis, commonly known as the Athens dwarf sandwort, is a small, flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in parts of its range."
