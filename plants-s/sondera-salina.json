    "intro": "Sondera salina, commonly known as salt marsh grass, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas where soil salinity is high, such as estuaries and tidal flats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that reduce water loss and withstand salt spray. Its root system is specialized to absorb and tolerate high levels of salt. Sondera salina plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various coastal organisms."
