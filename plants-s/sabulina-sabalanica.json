    "intro": "Sabulina sabalanica, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent leaves. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its growth habit is typically low and mat-forming, allowing it to survive in harsh mountain conditions. Sabulina sabalanica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
