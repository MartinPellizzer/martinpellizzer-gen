    "intro": "Saxifraga blanca, commonly known as the white saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Saxifraga blanca is often found in mountain meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
