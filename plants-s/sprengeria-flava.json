    "intro": "Sprengeria flava, commonly known as the yellow spider orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered threatened in some regions."
