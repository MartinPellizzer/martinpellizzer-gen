    "intro": "Syngonanthus gracilis f. prolifer, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a variant of the slender marsh grass native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a slight sheen, adapting to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. This form is notable for its ability to proliferate rapidly, contributing to the stabilization of muddy or sandy soils in wetlands."
