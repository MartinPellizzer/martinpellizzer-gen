    "intro": "Saprosma borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean saprosma, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which are followed by small, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
