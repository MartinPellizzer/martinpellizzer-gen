    "intro": "Stellaria sikaramensis, commonly known as the Sikaram starwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like carnations and chickweed. The plant is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers and delicate, hairy leaves. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stellaria sikaramensis is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
