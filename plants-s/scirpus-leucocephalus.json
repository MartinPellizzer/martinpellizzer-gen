    "intro": "Scirpus leucocephalus, commonly known as the white-headed bulrush, is a tall, aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshes in North America. It has long, narrow leaves that are typically green with a white or pale edge along the margins. The plant produces dense, cylindrical clusters of small white flowers at the top of its stems, which bloom in late summer. Scirpus leucocephalus is often found in shallow water and can thrive in a variety of soil types. Its presence is an indicator of healthy wetland ecosystems."
