    "intro": "Syngonanthus cowanii var. longipedunculatus, commonly known as the long-pedunculate rock heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features dense, compact foliage with narrow, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the autumn season, which are borne on long, slender peduncles. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environmental conditions."
