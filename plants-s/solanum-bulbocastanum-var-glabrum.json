    "intro": "Solanum bulbocastanum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, spiny stems and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into spherical, green berries, which turn red when mature. These berries are toxic and contain alkaloids, making the plant a potential hazard to livestock and humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
