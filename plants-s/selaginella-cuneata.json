    "intro": "Selaginella cuneata, commonly known as the zigzag spikemoss, is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its unique, spirally twisted stems. It is a vascular plant that exhibits a primitive structure, with small, scale-like leaves arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in humid conditions. Selaginella cuneata produces microspores and megaspores on separate cones, showcasing its reproductive strategy typical of primitive vascular plants. Its ability to survive in low-light conditions and retain moisture makes it an important component of certain ecosystems."
