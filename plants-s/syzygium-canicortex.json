    "intro": "Syzygium canicortex, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters and has elliptical, glossy leaves that are opposite in arrangement. Its small, fragrant flowers are white or pink and are followed by round, woody fruits containing several seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its native habitats."
