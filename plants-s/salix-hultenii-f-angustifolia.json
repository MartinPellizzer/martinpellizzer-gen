    "intro": "Salix hultenii f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
