    "intro": "Stemodiacra maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its tall, spiky stems and striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. Its root system is adapted to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. Stemodiacra maritima is often found in dunes and coastal cliffs, where it thrives in harsh, saline conditions."
