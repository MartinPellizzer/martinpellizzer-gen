    "intro": "Silene frivaldszkyana, commonly known as the Frivaldszky's campion, is a rare flowering plant native to the Carpathian Basin. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. It is distinguished by its slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
