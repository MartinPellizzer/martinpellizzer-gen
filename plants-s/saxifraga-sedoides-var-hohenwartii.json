    "intro": "Saxifraga sedoides var. hohenwartii, commonly known as the Hohenwart's saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features rosettes of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in the summer. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hairs, which help to retain moisture and protect against harsh weather. This variant is notable for its distinctive appearance and is often found in mountainous habitats across the Alps and Carpathian regions."
