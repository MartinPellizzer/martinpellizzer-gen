    "intro": "Scleria ciliata var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-fruited bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. Scleria ciliata var. glabrescens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize shorelines and provide habitat for aquatic life."
