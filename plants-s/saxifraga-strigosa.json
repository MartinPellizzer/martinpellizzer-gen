    "intro": "Saxifraga strigosa, commonly known as the mossy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the center of the rosette. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Saxifraga strigosa is often found in mountainous areas and is a common species in tundra and alpine habitats."
