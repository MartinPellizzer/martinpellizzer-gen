    "intro": "Senecio acetosifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb with slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
