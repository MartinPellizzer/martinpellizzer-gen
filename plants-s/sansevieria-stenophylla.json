    "intro": "Sansevieria stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf snake plant, is a striking succulent native to tropical regions of Africa. It features tall, upright leaves that are typically dark green with a bluish tint and often have a waxy coating. The plant is characterized by its narrow, strap-like foliage that can grow up to several feet in height. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers on slender stems, which appear in late summer or early fall. Sansevieria stenophylla is well adapted to low-light conditions and requires minimal water, making it an ideal houseplant."
