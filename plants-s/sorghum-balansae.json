    "intro": "Sorghum balansae, commonly known as the African millet, is a small annual grass native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, pale green or yellowish flowers that are wind-pollinated. It is adapted to grow in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient crop in drought-prone regions. Sorghum balansae is often used as a forage crop for livestock and has potential for human consumption in some regions."
