It belongs to the family Nymphaeaceae and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that open in the early morning. The plant has broad, floating leaves that form a dense layer on the water surface, aiding in photosynthesis. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the aquatic environment. Syncalathium was revered for its symbolic and medicinal properties in ancient cultures."
