    "intro": "Solanum aviculare var. grandifolium, commonly known as the large-leaved nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often pubescent and have a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
