    "intro": "Stellaria crispata, commonly known as the crinkled starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, ascending stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive, crinkled appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Stellaria crispata thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
