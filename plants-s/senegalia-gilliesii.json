    "intro": "Senegalia gilliesii, commonly known as the Texas screwbean, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its twisted, gnarled branches and small, bean-like pods that contain seeds. The plant has small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It is drought-tolerant and adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species in desert ecosystems. The Texas screwbean is also valued for its role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
