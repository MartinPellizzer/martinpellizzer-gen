It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, elongated fruits containing seeds. It is notable for containing toxic alkaloids, such as strychnine, which are present in its seeds and roots. Due to its toxicity, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest in botanical and pharmacological studies."
