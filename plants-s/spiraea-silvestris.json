    "intro": "Spiraea silvestris, commonly known as the wild spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring multiple stems that are often arching or upright. The plant is characterized by its clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate, with a serrated margin and a matte green surface. Spiraea silvestris is often found in woodland edges, stream banks, and moist meadows, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
