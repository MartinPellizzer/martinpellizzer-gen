It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a smooth texture, while the stems are woody and often covered in fine pubescence. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
