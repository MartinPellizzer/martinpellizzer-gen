    "intro": "Serapias lingua var. hirtula, commonly known as the hairy-tongued orchid, is a rare and specialized member of the orchid family. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. The plant produces striking, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive \"tongue\" shape, a feature that gives it its common name. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in Mediterranean climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
