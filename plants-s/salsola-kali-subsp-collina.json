    "intro": "Salsola kali subsp. collina, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant in the Amaranthaceae family. It is a drought-tolerant shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has succulent, spiny stems and produces small, greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually fleshy and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This subspecies is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
