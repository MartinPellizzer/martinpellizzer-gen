    "intro": "Syzygium elliptifolium, commonly known as the elliptifolium apple. It is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia. The plant features elliptical, leathery leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slight waxy coating. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in inflorescences, while the fruit is a smooth, apple-like berry that turns from green to yellow or red as it ripens. Syzygium elliptifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in subtropical gardens."
