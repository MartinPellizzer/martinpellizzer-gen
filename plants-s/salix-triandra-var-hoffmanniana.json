    "intro": "Salix triandra var. hoffmanniana, commonly known as the Hoffmann's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, particularly China and Nepal. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green during the growing season. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetland areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian zones."
