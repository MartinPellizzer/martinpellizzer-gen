It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in spikelets, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Scleria sobolifera thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, supporting various insect and bird species."
