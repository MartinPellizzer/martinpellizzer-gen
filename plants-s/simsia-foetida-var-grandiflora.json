It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a rough texture, and the stems are often hairy.
