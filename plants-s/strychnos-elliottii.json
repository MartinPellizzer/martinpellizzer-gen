It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it an important species in its native ecosystems, though it is often overlooked due to its relatively modest appearance."
