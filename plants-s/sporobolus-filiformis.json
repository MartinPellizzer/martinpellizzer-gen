    "intro": "Sporobolus filiformis, commonly known as wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and open woodlands. Its ability to form dense mats makes it an important pioneer species in disturbed areas. Sporobolus filiformis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in erosion-prone environments."
