    "intro": "Solidago altissima subsp. gilvocanescens, commonly known as the goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture, and the plant is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The subspecies gilvocanescens is distinguished by its more yellowish, often slightly bluish-green foliage compared to other goldenrod species."
