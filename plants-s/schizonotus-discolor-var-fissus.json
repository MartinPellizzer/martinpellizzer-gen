    "intro": "Schizonotus discolor var. fissus, commonly known as the fissured schizonotus, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbels, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
