    "intro": "Sonchus gigas, commonly known as giant sowthistle, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of large, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a single head, which are followed by spherical, prickly seed heads. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Sonchus gigas is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
