It is characterized by its thick, fleshy rhizomes and broad, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, typically arranged in a raceme. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
