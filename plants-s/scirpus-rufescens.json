    "intro": "Scirpus rufescens, commonly known as redstem bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that range in color from green to reddish-brown, especially when mature. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense clusters at the top of the stems, typically in late summer. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, making it a common species in marshes, ponds, and other wetland habitats. Scirpus rufescens plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
