    "intro": "Stellaria nemorum, commonly known as lesser starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats on woodland floors and moist meadows, with small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are borne in clusters at the ends of the stems, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Stellaria nemorum is often found in shaded, humid environments and is considered an indicator species for undisturbed, nutrient-rich soils."
