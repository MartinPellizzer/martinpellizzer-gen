    "intro": "Salvia coriifolia, commonly known as the coral bell or winter sage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, nodding clusters of violet to red flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Salvia coriifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
