It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other gourds and cucurbits. The plant is characterized by its large, elongated fruits that resemble bottles, hence its common name. It thrives in tropical climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
