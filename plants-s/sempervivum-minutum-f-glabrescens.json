    "intro": "Sempervivum minutum f. glabrescens, commonly known as the Woolly Chickweed or Woolly Stonecrop, is a low-growing, compact succulent with dense clusters of fleshy, rounded leaves. The leaves are typically gray-green to bluish-gray, covered in a fine, woolly coating that gives the plant its common name. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. This variety is particularly noted for its dense, cushion-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils. It is a hardy plant, often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in alpine settings."
