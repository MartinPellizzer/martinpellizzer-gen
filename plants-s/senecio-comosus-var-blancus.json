    "intro": "Senecio comosus var. blancus, commonly known as the white-leaf senecio, is a striking plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that ranges from white to pale green, giving it a unique, almost ethereal appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and susceptibility to pests, it requires careful cultivation and attention to environmental conditions."
