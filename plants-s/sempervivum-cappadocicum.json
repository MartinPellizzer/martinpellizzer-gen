    "intro": "Sempervivum cappadocicum, commonly known as the Cappadocia houseleek, is a hardy succulent native to the Cappadocia region of Turkey. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially in full sun. The plant produces tall, branched stems with clusters of star-shaped, pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for alpine gardens and container planting."
