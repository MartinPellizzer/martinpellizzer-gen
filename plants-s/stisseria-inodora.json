    "intro": "Stisseria inodora, commonly known as the sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features slender, aromatic stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are long, narrow, and slightly curved. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in early summer. Stisseria inodora is known for its pleasant, sweet scent, which becomes more pronounced when the plant is crushed. It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insect species."
