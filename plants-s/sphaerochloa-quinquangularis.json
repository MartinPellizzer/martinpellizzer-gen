    "intro": "Sphaerochloa quinquangularis, commonly known as the five-angled grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Sphaerochloa quinquangularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
