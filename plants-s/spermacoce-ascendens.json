    "intro": "Spermacoce ascendens, commonly known as the ascending sida, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant that typically grows up to 1 meter in height, featuring slender, branched stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender pedicels. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Spermacoce ascendens is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
