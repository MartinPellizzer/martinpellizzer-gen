    "intro": "Selaginella suavis var. haenkeana, commonly known as the sweet spore moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces tiny, spirally arranged leaves and has a unique ability to survive desiccation, making it highly resilient. Its spores are released in small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contribute to its reproductive strategy. This variety is distinguished by its aromatic foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
