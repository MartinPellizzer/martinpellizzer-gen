    "intro": "Schoenus dregeanus, commonly known as the dwarf papyrus, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense clumps, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early to mid-summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. Schoenus dregeanus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
