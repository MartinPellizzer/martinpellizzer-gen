    "intro": "Saxifraga egregia var. egregia, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in alpine gardens."
