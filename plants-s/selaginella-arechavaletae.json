    "intro": "Selaginella arechavaletae, commonly known as the Arechavaleta's spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and distinctive spore-bearing structures called strobila. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its sporophyte stage is usually short-lived, and it relies on spores for reproduction. Selaginella arechavaletae is of interest to botanists due to its evolutionary significance and limited distribution."
