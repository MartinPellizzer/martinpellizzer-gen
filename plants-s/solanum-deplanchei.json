    "intro": "Solanum deplanchei, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the evening, followed by berries that range in color from green to red. Solanum deplanchei is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of desert flora."
