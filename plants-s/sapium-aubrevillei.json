It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by woody, spherical fruits. Its bark is thick and fissured, often exuding a milky sap when damaged. Sapium aubrevillei is valued for its hard, durable wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
