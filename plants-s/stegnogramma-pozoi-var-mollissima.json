    "intro": "Stegnogramma pozoi var. mollissima, commonly known as the soft-stemmed stegnogramma, is a rare and lesser-known species within the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to specific regions of South America, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical structure includes a basal rosette of leaves and a flowering stem that rises above the foliage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and ecologically significant species."
