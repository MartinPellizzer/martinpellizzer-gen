    "intro": "Salix alaxensis subsp. longistylis, commonly known as the long-styled willow, is a shrub native to the arctic and alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white pubescence. The flowers are catkin-like, with the staminate (male) and pistillate (female) flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or rocky habitats. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
