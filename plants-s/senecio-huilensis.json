    "intro": "Senecio huilensis, commonly known as the Huiltepec groundsel, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, preferring moist, well-drained soils in mountainous areas. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, and its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like. Senecio huilensis is often found in cloud forests and is adapted to the cooler, humid climates of its native habitat."
