    "intro": "Spiranthes lancea, commonly known as the narrowleaf ladies' tresses, is a species of orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, spiraling inflorescence of pale yellow to white flowers, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and wet meadows. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, elongated seeds that are dispersed by wind. Spiranthes lancea is a perennial herb that plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
