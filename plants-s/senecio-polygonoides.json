    "intro": "Senecio polygonoides, commonly known as the African Daisy, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring wiry stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces bright yellow daisy-like flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
