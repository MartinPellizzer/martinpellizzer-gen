    "intro": "Stipavena, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, often followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Stipavena is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. It is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
