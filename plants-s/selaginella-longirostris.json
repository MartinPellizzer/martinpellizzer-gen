    "intro": "Selaginella longirostris, commonly known as the long-beaked spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping stems that produce upright, spirally arranged leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporophyte stage produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are often clustered at the tips of the stems. Selaginella longirostris is known for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
