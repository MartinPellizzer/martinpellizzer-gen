    "intro": "Stockwellia, commonly known as the candlewood tree, is a unique plant native to the island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by distinctive, woody, candle-like fruits. Stockwellia is adapted to the island's unique climate and is considered a relict species, surviving in a very limited geographic range. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is protected and studied to ensure its conservation."
