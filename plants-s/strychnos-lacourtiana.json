    "intro": "Strychnos lacourtiana, commonly known as the African strychnos, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces woody, berry-like fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy pulp. It is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for ornamental use but is of interest in botanical and ecological studies."
