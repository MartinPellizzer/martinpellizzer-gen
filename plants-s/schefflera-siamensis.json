    "intro": "Schefflera siamensis, commonly known as the Siam umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of large, dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as a decorative indoor plant. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for both ornamental and horticultural purposes."
