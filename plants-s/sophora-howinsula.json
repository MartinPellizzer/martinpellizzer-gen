    "intro": "Sophora howinsula, commonly known as the island sophora, is a small evergreen tree native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces elongated, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional cuisine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial shade to full sun. Due to its limited geographic range, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
