    "intro": "Statice alliacea var. matritensis, commonly known as the Spanish lavender or Matritense statice, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, spike-like inflorescences composed of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
