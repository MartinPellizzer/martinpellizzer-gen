    "intro": "Senecio johnstonii subsp. refractisquamatus, commonly known as the Johnston's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a low-growing perennial with dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a distinctive, waxy coating that reflects sunlight. This subspecies is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats."
