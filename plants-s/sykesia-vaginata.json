    "intro": "Sykesia vaginata, commonly known as the African velvet tree, is a small evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and glossy, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in terminal umbels, followed by spherical, red berries that are edible for humans and animals. Sykesia vaginata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities. It prefers well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
