    "intro": "Stenophyllus capillaris var. latesquamatus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed hairgrass, is a variant of the hairgrass species native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is often found in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and wet meadows. Its flowering structure consists of small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native environment."
