    "intro": "Sopubia carsonii, commonly known as Carson's sopubia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble single blooms. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in low-water environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Sopubia carsonii is known for its bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months."
