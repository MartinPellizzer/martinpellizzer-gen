    "intro": "Stipa lessingiana var. zeberbaueri, commonly known as the Zeberbauer's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and delicate, thread-like leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces fluffy, silver-gray panicles of seeds in late summer, which are adapted for wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
