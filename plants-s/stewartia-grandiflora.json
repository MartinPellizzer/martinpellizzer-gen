    "intro": "Stewartia grandiflora, commonly known as the Chinese stewartia, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces showy white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Stewartia grandiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
