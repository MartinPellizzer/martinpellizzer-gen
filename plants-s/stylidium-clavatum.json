    "intro": "Stylidium clavatum, commonly known as the clubbed sun-orchid, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers that resemble miniature orchids. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests or damp woodlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. Stylidium clavatum is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in supporting local pollinators."
