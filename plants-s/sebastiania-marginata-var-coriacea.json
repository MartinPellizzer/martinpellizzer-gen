    "intro": "Sebastiania marginata var. coriacea, commonly known as the rough-seeded sebastiania, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are leathery and covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
