It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has slender, branching stems covered with small, scale-like leaves that are often pale in color. Selaginella pallida is characterized by its ability to reproduce via spores, which are released from specialized structures called strobila. This plant is also notable for its resilience, as it can survive periods of drought and extreme temperatures."
