    "intro": "Strychnos horsfieldiana, commonly known as the Horsfield's nux vomica, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces woody, serpentine fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are rich in strychnine and brucine. Due to its toxic compounds, it is handled with caution and is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both medicinal and ecological studies."
