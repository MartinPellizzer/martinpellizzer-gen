It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and its ability to thrive in harsh, cold climates. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy soils and is often found in tundra and subarctic environments. Its slender branches and rapid growth make it an important component of these ecosystems. Salix hastata var. lapponica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small animals and insects."
