    "intro": "Stelis densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Stelis densiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and adaptability to controlled environments."
