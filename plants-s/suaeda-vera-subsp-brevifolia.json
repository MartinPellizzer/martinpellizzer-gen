    "intro": "Suaeda vera subsp. brevifolia, commonly known as coastal arrowgrass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in spike-like inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in coastal dunes and salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils. Its short stature and compact growth form make it well-suited for harsh, arid coastal conditions."
