    "intro": "Sporobolus arabicus var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf sparrowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its robust,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to greenish flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a common species in desert and steppe ecosystems. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soils and providing forage for grazing animals."
