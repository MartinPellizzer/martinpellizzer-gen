It features upright, sword-shaped leaves that are typically green with subtle variegation. The plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. It produces small, white flowers on slender stems during the growing season. Its resilience and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
