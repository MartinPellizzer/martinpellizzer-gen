    "intro": "Synaphea reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined fern, is a species of fern characterized by its intricate leaf structure. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance due to the fine network of veins. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
