    "intro": "Saccolabium armitii, commonly known as the woolly burr. It is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Australia, characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against extreme temperatures. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds covered in a fibrous, burr-like structure. Its botanical features include hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. It is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand long periods of drought."
