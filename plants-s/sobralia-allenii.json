    "intro": "Sobralia allenii, commonly known as the Allen's sobralia, is a species of orchid native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. Sobralia allenii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for under the right conditions."
