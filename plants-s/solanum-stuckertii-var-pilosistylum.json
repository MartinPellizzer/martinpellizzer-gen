It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of violet to purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, toxic berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
