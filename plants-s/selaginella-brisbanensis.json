    "intro": "Selaginella brisbanensis, commonly known as the Brisbane spikeweed, is a species of spikeweed native to Australia. It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and creek banks. The plant features slender, branching stems covered in tiny, scale-like leaves. It produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in cone-like formations. Selaginella brisbanensis is valued for its ecological role in maintaining soil stability and supporting local biodiversity."
