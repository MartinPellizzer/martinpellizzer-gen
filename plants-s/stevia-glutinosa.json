    "intro": "Stevia glutinosa, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a sticky resin, giving it its scientific name \"glutinosa,\" which means \"sticky.\" The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The leaves contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners used in food and beverages. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for both ornamental and commercial cultivation."
