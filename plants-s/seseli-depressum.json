    "intro": "Seseli depressum, commonly known as the dwarf hemlock, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
