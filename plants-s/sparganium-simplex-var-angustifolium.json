    "intro": "Sparganium simplex var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved bur reed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features slender, upright stems that bear small, spiky inflorescences, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. The leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy surface, and they form dense clumps at the base. This plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic environments. Its flowering period typically occurs in late summer, producing yellowish-brown spikes that attract various pollinators."
