    "intro": "Spergularia ramosa var. diffusa, commonly known as the sand spurry, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dunes. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It is a perennial species that plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local insect populations."
