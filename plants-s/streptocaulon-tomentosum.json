    "intro": "Streptocaulon tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly streptocaulon, is a herbaceous plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The species is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy environments."
