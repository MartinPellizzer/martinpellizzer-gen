    "intro": "Stipa maeotica, commonly known as the Crimean needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the steppes of Eastern Europe and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are usually green to brown in color. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and dunes. Stipa maeotica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
