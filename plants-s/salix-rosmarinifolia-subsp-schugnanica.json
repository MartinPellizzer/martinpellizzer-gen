    "intro": "Salix rosmarinifolia subsp. schugnanica, commonly known as the Schugnanica willow, is a shrub native to Central Asia, particularly found in regions of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and lanceolate leaves that are often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. The leaves are typically dark green on the upper surface and paler underneath, with a distinctive aromatic scent. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils."
