    "intro": "Scutia, commonly known as the flame-of-the-forest, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Scutia myrtifolia, which is native to southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their bright red or orange flowers, which bloom in clusters and are highly attractive to pollinators. Scutia species are typically shrubs or small trees, with simple, opposite leaves and smooth, often reddish bark. They prefer well-drained soils and full sun, making them suitable for cultivation in warm, arid climates."
