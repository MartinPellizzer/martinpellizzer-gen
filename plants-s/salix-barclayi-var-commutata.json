    "intro": "Salix barclayi var. commutata, commonly known as the Commutated willow, is a shrub-like plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, elongated leaves. The leaves are typically gray-green in color and have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. This plant is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often found in dry, open habitats such as riverbanks and slopes."
