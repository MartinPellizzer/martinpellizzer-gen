    "intro": "Sideritis ruscinonensis, commonly known as the Greek heather, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Greece and Albania. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, and its hairy, woody stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and valuable species in Mediterranean flora."
