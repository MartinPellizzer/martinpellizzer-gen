    "intro": "Sedum neapolitanum, commonly known as the Naples stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a dense rosette, which help it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or containers. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
