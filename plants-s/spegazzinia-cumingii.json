    "intro": "Spegazzinia cumingii, commonly known as the Cuming's spikemoss, is a rare and primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and spore-producing structures called strobila. Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant exhibits a unique life cycle involving both a gametophyte and a sporophyte stage. Its conservation status is vulnerable due to habitat destruction and limited distribution."
