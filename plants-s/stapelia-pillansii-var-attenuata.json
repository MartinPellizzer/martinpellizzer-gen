    "intro": "Stapelia pillansii var. attenuata, commonly known as the slender Stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves and stems. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators such as flies."
