    "intro": "Salceda, commonly known as the Mexican evergreen, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the genus Hymenocallis, which is part of the Amaryllidaceae family, known for its ornamental and sometimes toxic properties. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Salceda is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in desert environments. Its botanical characteristics make it both a resilient and visually appealing plant for xeriscaping and ornamental gardening."
