    "intro": "Selago muralis, commonly known as the wallflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky or coastal environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in poor soil. Selago muralis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and resilience to harsh conditions."
