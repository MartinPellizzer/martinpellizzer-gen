    "intro": "Saponaria officinalis var. plena, commonly known as the full-flowered soapwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom throughout the summer. The plant has hairy, upright stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The plant's name derives from the saponins it contains, which produce a soapy lather when crushed."
