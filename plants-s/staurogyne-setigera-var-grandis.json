    "intro": "Staurogyne setigera var. grandis, commonly known as the large-leaved water hyssop, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread through vegetative propagation. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, which bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a slightly hairy texture, often floating on the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats and is often found in marshes and pond margins."
