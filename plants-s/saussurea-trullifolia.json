    "intro": "Saussurea trullifolia, commonly known as the Alpine thistle, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, woolly leaves that are adapted to cold and arid conditions. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flower heads that are surrounded by pale blue or white bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is often found in rocky slopes and alpine meadows where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
