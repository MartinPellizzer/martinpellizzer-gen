It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with hairy stems and yellow flowers. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it produces small, orange-red berries that contain toxic seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in cultivation and is more commonly found in wild settings."
