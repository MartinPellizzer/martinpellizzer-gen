    "intro": "Salix obscura var. lanifera, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray pubescent foliage, which provides a distinctive appearance and helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, typical of the Salicaceae family, and its bark is often fissured and peeling. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert washes and rocky slopes. Due to its adaptability, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
