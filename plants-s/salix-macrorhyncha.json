    "intro": "Salix macrorhyncha, commonly known as the large-flowered willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Salix macrorhyncha plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various arctic and subarctic wildlife species."
