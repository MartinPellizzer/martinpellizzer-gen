    "intro": "Salix longifolia angustissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a species of willow native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and catkin-like flowers, which are typical of the Salicaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
