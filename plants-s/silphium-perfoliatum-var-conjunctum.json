    "intro": "Silphium perfoliatum var. conjunctum, commonly known as the common milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its upright stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often dotted with small, white or pale green stipules. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting a variety of pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, is a notable feature of its botanical makeup. This species plays an important role in supporting native wildlife and is often found in prairies and open woodlands."
