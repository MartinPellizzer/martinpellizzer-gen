    "intro": "Senegalia atlantica, commonly known as the African screw tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the Sahel region of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, twisted trunk and small, alternate leaves that are often clustered at the ends of branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. Senegalia atlantica is also valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as a source of fodder for livestock."
