    "intro": "Selaginella haydenii, commonly known as the Arizona clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its closely packed, scale-like leaves that form a dense, cushion-like structure. The plant is typically found in rocky soils and arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its sporophyte stage is the dominant phase in its life cycle. Selaginella haydenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
