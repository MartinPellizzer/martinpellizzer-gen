    "intro": "Saxifraga umbrosa var. linnaei, commonly known as the Linnaean saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, often clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The leaves are typically dark green, leathery, and have a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its harsh, alpine environment. This variety is closely related to the parent species, Saxifraga umbrosa, and shares similar ecological preferences. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats and is often found in rocky or scree slopes where it forms a ground cover."
