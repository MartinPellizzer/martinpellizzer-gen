    "intro": "Saxifraga granulifera, commonly known as the granulated saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and tundra environments. The plant features compact rosettes of hairy, gray-green leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its small, white or pale pink flowers bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its rugged habitat. Saxifraga granulifera plays a role in stabilizing soil in its extreme environment and is a characteristic species of polar and alpine flora."
