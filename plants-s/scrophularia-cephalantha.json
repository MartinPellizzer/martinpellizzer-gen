    "intro": "Scrophularia cephalantha, commonly known as the purple marsh willow, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland areas of North America. It features slender, hairy stems that often grow in clusters, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. The plant produces showy, violet to purple flowers in whorled clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Scrophularia cephalantha plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is valued for its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
