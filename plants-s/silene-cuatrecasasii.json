    "intro": "Silene cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas's campion, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its pink to red flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Silene cuatrecasasii is considered a vulnerable species."
