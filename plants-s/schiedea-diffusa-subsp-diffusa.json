    "intro": "Schiedea diffusa subsp. diffusa, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 silversword, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, high-altitude habitat. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of the Haleakal\u0101 volcano's summit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and protected species."
