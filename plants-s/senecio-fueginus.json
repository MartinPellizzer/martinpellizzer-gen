    "intro": "Senecio fueginus, commonly known as the Andes groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and has a low, mat-like growth habit. Its leaves are often grayish-green and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in the summer months. Senecio fueginus is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions and plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
