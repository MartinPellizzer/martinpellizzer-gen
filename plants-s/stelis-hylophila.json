    "intro": "Stelis hylophila, commonly known as the Hawaiian spider orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in Hawaii. It is a small, epiphytic plant that grows on tree trunks and branches in the rainforest canopy. The plant has a compact growth habit with a single, short stem and a few leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of spider webs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
