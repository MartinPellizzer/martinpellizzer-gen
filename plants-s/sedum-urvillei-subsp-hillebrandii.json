    "intro": "Sedum urvillei subsp. hillebrandii, commonly known as the Hillebrand's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky habitats in Central Asia. It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically during the summer months. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats, often covering rocky outcrops. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
