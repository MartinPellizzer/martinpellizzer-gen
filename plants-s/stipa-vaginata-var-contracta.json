    "intro": "Stipa vaginata var. contracta, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green blades and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for rocky or dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil. Its botanical features make it an important component of native grassland ecosystems."
