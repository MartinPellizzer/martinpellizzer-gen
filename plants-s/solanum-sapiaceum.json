    "intro": "Solanum sapiaceum, commonly known as the common nightshade, is a flowering plant native to various regions of Europe and Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring alternate, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by berries that start green and ripen to a vibrant red. These berries contain toxic alkaloids, making the plant potentially harmful to humans and animals. Botanically, it belongs to the Solanaceae family, which also includes tomatoes, peppers, and potatoes."
