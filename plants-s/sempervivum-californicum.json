    "intro": "Sempervivum californicum, commonly known as the Sierra stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to the western United States. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wool. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and can thrive in full sun. Sempervivum californicum is drought-tolerant and often used in xeriscaping due to its hardy nature."
