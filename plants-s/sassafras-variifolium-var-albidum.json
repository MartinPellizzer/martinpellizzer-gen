It is characterized by its distinctive, trifoliate leaves that are often white-veined and emit a sweet, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, spherical fruits. Its roots and leaves have been historically used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. The white sassafras is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its ornamental appeal in gardens."
