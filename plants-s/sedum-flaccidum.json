    "intro": "Sedum flaccidum, commonly known as the flaccid stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments in North America. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are typically arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to withstand drought and poor soil conditions makes it a popular plant for low-maintenance landscaping."
