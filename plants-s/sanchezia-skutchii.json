    "intro": "Sanchezia skutchii, commonly known as the Skutch's arrowroot, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are often broad and glossy, and it produces edible tubers similar to those of traditional arrowroot species. Sanchezia skutchii is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its potential culinary uses."
