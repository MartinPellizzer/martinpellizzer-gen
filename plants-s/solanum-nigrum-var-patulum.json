    "intro": "Solanum nigrum var. patulum, commonly known as the broadleaf nightshade, is a variant of the common nightshade plant. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in temperate regions, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant features broad, ovate leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into dark purple or black berries. Its berries are toxic to humans and animals, containing solanine and other alkaloids. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though with caution."
