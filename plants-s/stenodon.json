    "intro": "Stenodon, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flowers that resemble small holly berries, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and saline soils, adapting to harsh maritime environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and succulent, helping to reduce water loss in salty conditions. Stenodon plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
