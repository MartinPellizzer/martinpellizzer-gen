    "intro": "Stellaria ingrica, commonly known as white stellaria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Stellaria ingrica is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to spread through runners."
