    "intro": "Sparganium pubescens, commonly known as the hairy burr rush, is a wetland plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of spiky, reddish-brown flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant produces small, hairy seed capsules that disperse by wind. Sparganium pubescens plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
