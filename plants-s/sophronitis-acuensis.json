    "intro": "Sophronitis acuensis, commonly known as the Acuense Catasetum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its intricate, fragrant flowers that typically feature a complex structure with a labellum and column. The plant produces a single, showy bloom that can range in color from white to pale yellow, often with contrasting markings. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its natural range."
