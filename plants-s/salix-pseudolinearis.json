    "intro": "Salix pseudolinearis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a species of flowering plant in the willow family, Salicaceae. It is characterized by its slender, narrow leaves that are often slightly serrated along the edges. This plant typically grows in moist environments such as riverbanks, wet meadows, and stream sides. Its catkin-like flowers appear in early spring, contributing to its role in pollination and ecological succession. The bark of Salix pseudolinearis is generally smooth and may exhibit a pale or grayish color."
