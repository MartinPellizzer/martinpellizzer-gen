It is characterized by its narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces spikes of violet to purple flowers during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant gardens."
