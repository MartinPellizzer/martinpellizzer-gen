    "intro": "Stylidium floribundum, commonly known as the showy sun-orchid, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, spurred flowers. The plant typically features a basal rosette of leaves and produces numerous showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in spring. Its unique floral structure includes a long, slender spur that houses the nectar, attracting specific pollinators like birds and insects. Stylidium floribundum is often found in sandy or rocky soils in arid or semi-arid regions."
