    "intro": "Salix purpurea subsp. purpurea, commonly known as purple willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically purple-tinged on the underside. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist environments such as riverbanks and wetlands, often forming dense colonies. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate wet soils make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
