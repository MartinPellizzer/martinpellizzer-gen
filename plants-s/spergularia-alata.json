    "intro": "Spergularia alata, commonly known as the winged sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to sandy and coastal areas. It is characterized by its distinctive, winged stems that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by reddish, fleshy fruits. It is a member of the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is often found in dunes and disturbed soils. Spergularia alata is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
