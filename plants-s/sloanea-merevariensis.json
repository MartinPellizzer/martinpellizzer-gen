    "intro": "Sloanea merevariensis, commonly known as the Andean sloanea, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces woody capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Sloanea merevariensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
