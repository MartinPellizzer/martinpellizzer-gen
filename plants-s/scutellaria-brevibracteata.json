It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has a distinctive square stem with opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its genus, Scutellaria, is characterized by a unique structure called the scutellum, which is a hood-like covering over the flower. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
