    "intro": "Seychellaria thomassetii, commonly known as the Seychelles starling tree, is a rare endemic species native to the Seychelles. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and showy, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, black, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss. Botanically, it is notable for its unique floral structure and ecological role in the Seychelles' biodiversity."
