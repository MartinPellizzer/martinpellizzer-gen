    "intro": "Solenopsis minuta var. minima, commonly known as the tiny fire ant, is a diminutive species of ant within the genus Solenopsis. It is characterized by its small size, typically measuring less than 2 millimeters in length, and its reddish-brown coloration. This variant is often found in sandy or disturbed soils, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant aspect refers to its association with vegetation, as it tends to nest in or near plant matter. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an invasive species in certain ecosystems, impacting local flora and fauna."
