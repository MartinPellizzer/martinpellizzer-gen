    "intro": "Sicyocarya mauiensis, commonly known as Maui's rock fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in shaded, moist environments on rocky substrates. The plant has a unique morphology, with a short, creeping rhizome and small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and invasive species. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this rare botanical treasure."
