    "intro": "Senna pistaciifolia var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth senna, is a shrub native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves, which are glabrous, or smooth to the touch. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, typical of the Fabaceae family, and the pods are linear and often hairy. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species adapted to drought conditions. The plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine and for soil stabilization in degraded landscapes."
