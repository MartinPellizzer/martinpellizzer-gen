    "intro": "Salix phlebophylla, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive silvery-gray bark. The leaves are elongated, lance-shaped, and have a finely serrated margin, while the catkins are typically yellow-green in color. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
