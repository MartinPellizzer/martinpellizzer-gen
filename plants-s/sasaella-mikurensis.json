It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves and culms that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its rarity, Sasaella mikurensis is considered an endangered species, highlighting the need for habitat preservation."
