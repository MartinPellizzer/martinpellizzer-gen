    "intro": "Sempervivum marmoreum f. brunneifolium, commonly known as the Brown-leaved Stonecrop, is a compact, low-growing succulent with a rosette-forming structure. Its leaves are typically a deep brown or reddish-brown, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is native to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
