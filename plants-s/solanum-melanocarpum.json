    "intro": "Solanum melanocarpum, commonly known as the black fruit nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into dark purple to black berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
