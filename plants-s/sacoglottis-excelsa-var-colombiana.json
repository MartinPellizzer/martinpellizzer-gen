It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its large, compound leaves and showy, umbrella-like flower clusters. The plant can grow up to several meters in height, making it a dominant feature in its natural habitat. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. The flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are typically white or pale pink, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
