    "intro": "Salix lancifera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, including China, India, and the Himalayas. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as riverbanks and wetlands. The plant has slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its catkins are a key feature, with male and female flowers occurring on separate catkins, a characteristic common in willow species. Salix lancifera is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
