    "intro": "Styphelia psiloclada, commonly known as the purple moor heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of North America. It typically thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and dune environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, contributing to its ability to survive in harsh, coastal conditions. Styphelia psiloclada is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local ecosystems."
