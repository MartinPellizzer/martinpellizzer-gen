    "intro": "Saussurea alata, commonly known as the winged thistle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, and often winged stems that are covered with dense, white or grayish hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered with a thick layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Saussurea alata is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes."
