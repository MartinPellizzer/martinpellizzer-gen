    "intro": "Saxifraga intricata var. coarctata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It typically features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, narrow, and often toothed leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Saxifraga intricata var. coarctata is often found in mountain tundra and alpine meadows where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
