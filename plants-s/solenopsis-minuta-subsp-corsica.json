    "intro": "Solenopsis minuta subsp. corsica, commonly known as the Corsican fire ant, is a small, reddish-brown ant species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender body and long, slender legs, typical of many ant species. The plant it inhabits, though not a plant itself, is often found in grassy or shrubby habitats, where it forages for food. Its colonies are known for their aggressive behavior and ability to form large, complex nests. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a pest in some regions outside its native range."
