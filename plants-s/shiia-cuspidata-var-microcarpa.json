    "intro": "Shiia cuspidata var. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited shiia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by small, round fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it competes with other shade-tolerant species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
