It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies, due to their nectar-rich structure.
