    "intro": "Stevia serrata var. haplopappa, commonly known as the smoothleaf stevia, is a perennial herb native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are serrated along the edges, though the variety haplopappa has smoother leaf margins compared to other stevia species. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring or early summer. It is valued for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners used in food and beverages. Due to its adaptability and low maintenance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental and functional plant in gardens and agricultural settings."
