    "intro": "Salix nigra var. venulosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its root system is fibrous and helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in wetland restoration. The leaves are often used in traditional herbal remedies for their astringent properties."
