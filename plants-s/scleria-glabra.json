    "intro": "Scleria glabra, commonly known as the smooth scleria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale blue or white flowers. Scleria glabra is typically found in wet or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its botanical structure reflects its adaptation to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments."
