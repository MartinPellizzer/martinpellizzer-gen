    "intro": "Sida gertiana, commonly known as desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are oval-shaped with a hairy texture. Sida gertiana is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often with deep roots to access groundwater. It is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soils, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
