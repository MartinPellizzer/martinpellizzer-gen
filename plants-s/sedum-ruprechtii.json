    "intro": "Sedum ruprechtii, commonly known as the rock sedum, is a succulent plant native to rocky and arid environments in Europe and Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soil and full sun, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping. Sedum ruprechtii is also valued for its ability to prevent soil erosion on slopes and rocky outcrops."
