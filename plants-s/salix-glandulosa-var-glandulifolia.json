    "intro": "Salix glandulosa var. glandulifolia, commonly known as the glandular willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and small, oval leaves with glandular dots along the veins. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it often grows in moist, sandy soils near streams or wetlands. It is a member of the Salicaceae family, which includes other willow species. Its botanical features make it well adapted to riparian environments and ecological restoration projects."
