    "intro": "Specklinia flosculifera, commonly known as the clustered polka dot plant, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is native to Madagascar. It is a compact, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense clusters of small, rounded leaves that are often variegated with white or cream markings. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink or red, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Specklinia flosculifera is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
