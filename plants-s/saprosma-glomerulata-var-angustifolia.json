    "intro": "Saprosma glomerulata var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bottlebrush, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescences that resemble bottle brushes, composed of numerous small, red or pink flowers. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, providing a contrasting texture to the showy floral displays. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
