    "intro": "Stelis dunstervilleorum, commonly known as the Dunsterville's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other objects without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis dunstervilleorum is valued in horticulture for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
