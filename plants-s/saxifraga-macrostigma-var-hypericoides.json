    "intro": "Saxifraga macrostigma var. hypericoides, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate harsh conditions make it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture."
