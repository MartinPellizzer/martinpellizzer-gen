    "intro": "Sonchus tuberosus, commonly known as earth apple or Jerusalem artichoke, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems, heart-shaped leaves, and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces edible tubers underground, which are starchy and have a nutty flavor. These tubers are rich in inulin, a type of dietary fiber, and have been used in traditional medicine and as a food source. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas."
