    "intro": "Sporobolus arcuatus, commonly known as the bentgrass or silky grass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and fine, blue-green foliage that often forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and disturbed areas. Sporobolus arcuatus is valued for its erosion control capabilities and its use in restoration ecology."
