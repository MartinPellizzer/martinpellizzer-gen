    "intro": "Sphaerolobium calcicola, commonly known as the limestone burr or rock burr, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, typically in clusters along the stems. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs. Sphaerolobium calcicola is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
