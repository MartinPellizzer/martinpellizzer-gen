    "intro": "Stellilabium bennettii, commonly known as the Bennett's star-labium, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, which includes many diverse and often showy orchid species. The plant is characterized by its unique, star-shaped floral structure, which is both ornamental and ecologically significant. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Stellilabium bennettii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
