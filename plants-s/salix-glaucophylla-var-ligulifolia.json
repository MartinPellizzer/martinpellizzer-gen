It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glaucous underneath. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary floral structures, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in riparian zones and is adapted to a variety of environmental conditions. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat restoration."
