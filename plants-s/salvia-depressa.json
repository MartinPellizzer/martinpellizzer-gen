    "intro": "Salvia depressa, commonly known as the prostrate sage, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, hairy stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Salvia depressa is valued in xeriscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
