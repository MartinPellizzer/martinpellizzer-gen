    "intro": "Schomburgkia anceps, commonly known as the pink orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant pink and white flowers that bloom in summer, adding a dramatic visual display to its habitat. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. Schomburgkia anceps is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or warm climates."
