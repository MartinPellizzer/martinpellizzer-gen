    "intro": "Saussurea imperialis, commonly known as the Royal Gentian, is a striking alpine plant native to the high elevations of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, helping to retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowers are typically arranged in a single, terminal inflorescence, and they emit a faint, sweet fragrance. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Saussurea imperialis is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from climate change and habitat loss."
