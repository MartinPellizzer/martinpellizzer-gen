    "intro": "Senecio viejoanus, commonly known as the Viejoanus groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Senecio viejoanus is often found in crevices and along canyon walls, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil."
