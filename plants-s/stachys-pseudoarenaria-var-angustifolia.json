    "intro": "Stachys pseudoarenaria var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf hedge nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its slender, angular stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale purple to white flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, which bloom during the summer months. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and dry meadows. Its fibrous roots and drought-tolerant nature make it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
