    "intro": "Salix alba var. splendens, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a variant of the white willow species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter underside. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and ponds. This plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to stabilize riverbanks through its extensive root system."
