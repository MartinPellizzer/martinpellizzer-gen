    "intro": "Scirpus maritimus var. paludosus, commonly known as the marsh bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-brown spikelets at the top of the stems. Its roots form extensive rhizomes, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in marshy areas. It thrives in brackish or freshwater habitats, often found in tidal marshes and along the edges of ponds."
