    "intro": "Santalum macgregorii, commonly known as the black sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia. It is a hemi-parasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or green, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Its heartwood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and has been traditionally used in incense and perfumery. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now listed as endangered in its native range."
