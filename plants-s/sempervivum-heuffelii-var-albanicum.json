    "intro": "Sempervivum heuffelii var. albanicum, commonly known as the Albanian stonecrop, is a compact, low-growing succulent with fleshy, rosette-forming leaves. It originates from the Balkan region and is well adapted to rocky, dry environments. The leaves are typically green with a bluish or reddish tinge, depending on light exposure. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. This variety is prized for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
