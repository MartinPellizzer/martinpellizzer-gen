    "intro": "Scyphocoronis incurva, commonly known as the curled false hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. Scyphocoronis incurva is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils."
