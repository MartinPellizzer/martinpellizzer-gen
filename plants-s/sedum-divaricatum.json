It features fleshy, upright stems that often curve in a zigzag pattern, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and easy to care for. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
