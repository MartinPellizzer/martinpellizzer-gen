    "intro": "Sorbus multijuga, commonly known as the alpine whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape and often have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by edible berries that are typically red or orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
