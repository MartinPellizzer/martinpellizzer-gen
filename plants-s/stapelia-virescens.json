    "intro": "Stapelia virescens, commonly known as the green stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, meaty flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it blooms during the warmer months. Stapelia virescens is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal watering, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
