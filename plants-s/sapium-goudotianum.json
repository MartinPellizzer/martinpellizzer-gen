It features opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange to red berries that contain several seeds. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact."
