    "intro": "Sommera montana, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically features dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a compact, mat-forming habit with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky environments. Sommera montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in difficult terrains."
