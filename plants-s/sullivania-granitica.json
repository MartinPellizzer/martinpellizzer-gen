    "intro": "Sullivania granitica, commonly known as the granite sullivania, is a rare and hardy plant native to specific regions with rocky, well-drained soils. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to thrive in full sun and is drought-tolerant once established. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Sullivania granitica is considered a valuable species for ecological and botanical study."
