    "intro": "Sonerila harmandii, commonly known as the Harmand's strobilanthes, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy bracts that resemble flowers. The plant typically grows as an erect herb with opposite, ovate leaves that are often pubescent. It produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pale green or white, clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sonerila harmandii is considered a rare and endangered species."
