    "intro": "Solanum nigrum f. pallidum, commonly known as the pale-fruited nightshade, is a variant of the common nightshade plant. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant features small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that transition from green to a pale yellow or orange color. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This form is noted for its reduced pigmentation in the fruits compared to the typical Solanum nigrum."
