    "intro": "Stelis gracilifolia, commonly known as the slender-leaved orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. It prefers warm, humid environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both horticultural and conservation studies."
