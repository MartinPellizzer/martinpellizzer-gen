    "intro": "Sorghum nutans var. elongatum, commonly known as the elongated sorghum, is a variant of the sorghum species characterized by its distinctive elongated panicle structure. This plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions and thrives in warm climates with well-drained soils. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a hairy texture, while the stems are sturdy and typically grow upright. The flowers are small and clustered in a loose panicle, which is an adaptation for efficient wind pollination. It is primarily cultivated for its grain, which is used in food, animal feed, and biofuel production."
