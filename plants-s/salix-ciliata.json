    "intro": "Salix ciliata, commonly known as the silky willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its finely toothed, gray-green leaves that are covered in silky hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its main floral structures, typically appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. Salix ciliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
