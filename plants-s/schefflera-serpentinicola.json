    "intro": "Schefflera serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentinite schefflera, is a rare and unique plant species native to the ultramafic soils of Madagascar. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, compound leaves that are adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, magnesium-rich environments. The plant exhibits a shrub-like growth habit with thick, waxy foliage that helps it retain moisture in its harsh native habitat. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-white in color, and it produces berries that are edible for certain local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
