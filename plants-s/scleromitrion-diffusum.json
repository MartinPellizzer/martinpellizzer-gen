    "intro": "Scleromitrion diffusum, commonly known as the spreading rock cress, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pungent scent. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a low, sprawling growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Scleromitrion diffusum is adapted to survive in extreme conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
