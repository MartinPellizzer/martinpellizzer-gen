    "intro": "Spiraea obtusiloba, commonly known as the blunt-leaf spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It features slender, arching stems that produce clusters of delicate, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. The leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a blunt tip and a smooth, waxy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. This plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
