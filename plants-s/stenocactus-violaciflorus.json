    "intro": "Stenocactus violaciflorus, commonly known as the violet-flowered stenocactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, spiny cactus characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense clustering of spines. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid conditions. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
