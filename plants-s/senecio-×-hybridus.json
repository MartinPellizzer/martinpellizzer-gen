    "intro": "Senecio \u00d7 hybridus, commonly known as the hybrid groundsel, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Senecio auricula and Senecio cineraria. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover. The plant produces small, dandelion-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid and rocky environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is popular among gardeners in regions with mild winters."
