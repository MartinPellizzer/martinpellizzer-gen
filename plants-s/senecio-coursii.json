    "intro": "Senecio coursii, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Senecio coursii plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals."
