    "intro": "Sambucus mexicana var. velutina, commonly known as velvet elderberry, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces small, dark purple berries in the fall, which are edible but should be consumed with caution due to their potential toxicity. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
