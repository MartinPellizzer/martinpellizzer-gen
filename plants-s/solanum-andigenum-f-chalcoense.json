    "intro": "Solanum andigenum f. chalcoense, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a botanical variant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-white leaf pubescence, which gives it its common name. The plant belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other notable species such as tomatoes and peppers. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine conditions. Its flowers are usually purple or violet, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste."
