    "intro": "Selago nyasae, commonly known as the Nyasae sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many species of flowering plants characterized by their showy flowers and often succulent leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. Its small, white or pale pink flowers bloom in clusters, and it has a compact, low-growing habit. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Selago nyasae is considered a rare and endemic species."
