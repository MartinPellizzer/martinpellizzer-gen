    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 negata, commonly known as the Chinese weeping willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to China and parts of Korea. It is characterized by its long, cascading branches that create a distinctive weeping appearance, often drooping to the ground. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by narrow, elongated fruits. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and along waterways for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
