    "intro": "Solidago virgaurea subsp. virgaurea, commonly known as the lesser goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features upright, branching stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. Its most striking feature is its clusters of bright yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
