    "intro": "Schisandra henryi var. yunnanensis, commonly known as Yunnan schisandra, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Schisandraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive red berries that contain aromatic compounds. The plant is typically found in humid, temperate forests at high altitudes, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its botanical features include compound leaves with five to seven leaflets and small, yellowish-green flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in botanical studies."
