    "intro": "Sophora littoralis, commonly known as the coastal sophora, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of East Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by elongated pods containing flat, bean-like seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments, which help reduce water loss in its saline environment. Sophora littoralis is valued for its ability to stabilize coastal dunes and its historical use in traditional medicine."
