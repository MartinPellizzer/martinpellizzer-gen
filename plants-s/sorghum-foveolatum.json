    "intro": "Sorghum foveolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sorghum, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, narrow leaves and compact inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. It has fibrous roots and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Sorghum foveolatum is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and adaptability."
