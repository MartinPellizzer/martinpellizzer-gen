    "intro": "Syngonanthus phelpsiae var. pilosus, commonly known as the pilose sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the southeastern United States. It features small, fleshy, green leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or disturbed areas. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
