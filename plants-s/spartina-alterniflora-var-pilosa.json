    "intro": "Spartina alterniflora var. pilosa, commonly known as saltmeadow cordgrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of the United States. It thrives in brackish and saline wetlands, playing a crucial role in stabilizing tidal soils and preventing erosion. The plant has long, narrow leaves with a dense covering of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against salt spray. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like clusters of pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Spartina alterniflora var. pilosa is an important component of estuarine ecosystems, supporting a variety of wildlife and contributing to nutrient cycling."
