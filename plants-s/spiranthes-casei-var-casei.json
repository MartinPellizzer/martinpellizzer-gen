    "intro": "Spiranthes casei var. casei, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ladies' tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive spiral arrangement of pale pink to white flowers. This species thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as wetlands, bogs, and along stream banks. The plant produces a single, cylindrical spike of flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. It is a non-woody plant with a rhizomatous root system, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
