    "intro": "Selliguea pentaphylla, commonly known as the five-leaf liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a cryptogamic plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a flattened, leaf-like body that is often covered in small, scale-like structures. Its reproductive structures, including male and female gametophytes, are borne on the thallus, allowing for sexual reproduction. Selliguea pentaphylla plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
