    "intro": "Saxifraga lingulata var. catalaunica, commonly known as the Catalaunica saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Carpathian Mountains. It features basal rosettes of lanceolate, dark green leaves with a waxy coating, adapted to thrive in rocky and alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. It prefers well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
