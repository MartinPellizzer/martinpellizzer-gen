    "intro": "Senecio arborescens, commonly known as the tree-like groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub that can grow up to 2 meters tall, characterized by its branching, woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Senecio arborescens is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
