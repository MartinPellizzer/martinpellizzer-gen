    "intro": "Saponaria jagelii, commonly known as the jagel's soapwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces a milky sap that has mild soap-like properties, which is why it is related to the genus Saponaria. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Saponaria jagelii thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders."
