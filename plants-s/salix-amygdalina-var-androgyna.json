    "intro": "Salix amygdalina var. androgyna, commonly known as the European white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, though this variety is andromonoecious, meaning it has both male and female flowers on the same individual. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a serrated margin, often turning yellow in autumn. The plant is known for its medicinal uses, particularly for its salicin content, which is similar to the active ingredient in willow bark."
