    "intro": "Sorbus torminalis f. rotundata, commonly known as the round-leaved whitebeam, is a botanical variant of the whitebeam tree. It is characterized by its distinctive round or oval-shaped leaves, which are typically larger and more lobed than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by red or orange berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or on rocky slopes. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
