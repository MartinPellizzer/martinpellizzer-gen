It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and flowering spikes. The plant produces small, reddish-brown flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along streambanks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
