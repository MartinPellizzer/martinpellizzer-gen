    "intro": "[WRONG START] Sagina kuzenecae, commonly known as the Kuzenev's sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and rocky environments. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its tiny, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant has small, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert regions. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
