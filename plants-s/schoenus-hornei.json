    "intro": "Schoenus hornei, commonly known as the yellow bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with yellow or golden hues. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its adaptability to moist conditions makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
