    "intro": "Salix cordata var. abrasa, commonly known as the smooth willow or silky willow, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and heart-shaped, finely toothed leaves that are covered in a soft, silvery down. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are essential for its reproduction and pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and streams. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects."
