    "intro": "Saponaria syriaca, commonly known as Syrian soapwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright stems that bear clusters of pink or white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy, while the upper leaves are smaller and sessile. Its roots contain saponins, which give it a soapy texture when crushed. Saponaria syriaca is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and historical use in soap-making."
