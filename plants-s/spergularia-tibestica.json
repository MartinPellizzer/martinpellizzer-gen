    "intro": "Spergularia tibestica, commonly known as the Tibesti sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Tibesti Mountains in Chad. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure adapted to withstand harsh desert conditions. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers with five petals, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, helping to store water in its native habitat. Spergularia tibestica plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for local fauna."
