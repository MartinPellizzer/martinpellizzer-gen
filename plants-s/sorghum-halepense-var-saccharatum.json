    "intro": "Sorghum halepense var. saccharatum, commonly known as sweet sorghum, is a variant of the common broomcorn millet. It is a tall, perennial grass that can grow up to 3 meters in height, with dense clusters of spikelets at the top of its stalks. The plant is characterized by its fibrous stalks and sweet, juicy juice in its stem, which is used for syrup production. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color. It thrives in warm climates and is often found in disturbed soils, making it an invasive species in some regions."
