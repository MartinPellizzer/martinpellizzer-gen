    "intro": "Salix plocotricha, commonly known as the Chinese willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens and landscapes in temperate regions."
