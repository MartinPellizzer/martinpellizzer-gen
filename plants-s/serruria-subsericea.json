It is characterized by its thick, fleshy, silver-blue leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and prefers well-draining soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
