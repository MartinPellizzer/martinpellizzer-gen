    "intro": "Statice castellana, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and cliffs where it withstands strong winds and salt spray. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom from late summer to early autumn. Its fibrous roots help stabilize coastal soils, making it an important species for dune restoration. Statice castellana is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
