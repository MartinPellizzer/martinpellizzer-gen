    "intro": "Scirpus sylvaticus f. cephaloideus, commonly known as the broad-leaved bulrush, is a variant of the common bulrush, characterized by its broader, more rounded leaves. It is a perennial wetland plant that thrives in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomes are robust, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic life."
