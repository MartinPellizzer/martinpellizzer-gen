    "intro": "Sarcocephalus officinalis, commonly known as the African bitters or mountain bitters, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by dark blue, fleshy berries. It is often found in rocky, mountainous regions and is adapted to dry, nutrient-poor soils. The leaves and roots are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
