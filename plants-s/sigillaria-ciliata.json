    "intro": "Sigillaria ciliata, commonly known as the fringed sigillaria, is a member of the water lily family (Nymphaeaceae). It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are often adorned with fine, thread-like hairs along the margins. The plant produces showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its leaves are typically circular or ovate, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Sigillaria ciliata is commonly found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes."
