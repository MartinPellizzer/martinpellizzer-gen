    "intro": "Stellaria franchetii var. sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flowered starwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its pink or white flowers and succulent leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, often with a short petiole, and the flowers are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. This variant is distinguished by its sessile (nearly stemless) floral bracts, which contribute to its unique botanical appearance."
