It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like flowers that are arranged in loose, cylindrical clusters. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, a characteristic feature of the grass family. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in native landscapes."
