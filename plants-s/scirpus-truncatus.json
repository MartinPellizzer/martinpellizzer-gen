    "intro": "Scirpus truncatus, commonly known as the cut-leaved bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in spike-like clusters at the top of the stems. Its leaves are narrow, sword-shaped, and often have a distinctive cut or notch at the base. Scirpus truncatus thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
