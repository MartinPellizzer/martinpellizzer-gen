    "intro": "Synaedrys lauterbachii, commonly known as the Lauterbach's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a unique morphology, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Synaedrys lauterbachii is considered a critically endangered species."
