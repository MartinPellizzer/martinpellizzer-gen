    "intro": "Sorghum iwarancusa, commonly known as wild sorghum, is a robust grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
