It is a perennial vine characterized by its woody stems and thorny growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are an important food source for certain bird species. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests."
