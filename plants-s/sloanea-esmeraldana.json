It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and elongated, elliptical leaves that are often glossy in appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Sloanea esmeraldana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various native wildlife species."
