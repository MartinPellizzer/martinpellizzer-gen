    "intro": "Selaginella madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, low-growing plant that typically forms dense mats on rocky substrates or in moist, shaded environments. The plant possesses true leaves and sporophylls, which are specialized structures for spore production. Its sporophyte stage is dominant in its life cycle, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Selaginella madagascariensis is notable for its ability to survive in arid conditions, making it an important component of its native ecosystems."
