    "intro": "Statice plantaginea var. brachylepis, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces small, delicate blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it retain moisture. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh maritime conditions."
