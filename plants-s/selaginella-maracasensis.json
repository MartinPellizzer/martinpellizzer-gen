It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features whorled leaves that are usually spirally arranged around its stems, which are often prostrate or ascending. Its reproductive structures include microsporangia and megasporangia, which are located on specialized leaves called sporophylls. Selaginella maracasensis is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitats."
