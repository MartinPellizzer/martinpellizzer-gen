    "intro": "Salix blyttii, commonly known as the Blytt's willow, is a species of shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and wetland habitats. Salix blyttii plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various arctic wildlife species."
