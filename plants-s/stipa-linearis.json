    "intro": "Stipa linearis, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or along roadsides. Stipa linearis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
