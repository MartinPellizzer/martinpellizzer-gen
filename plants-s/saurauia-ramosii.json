    "intro": "Saurauia ramosii, commonly known as the hairy leaved evergreen, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of China, Vietnam, and Thailand. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are typically leathery and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often humid and shaded habitat. Saurauia ramosii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to shaded environments."
