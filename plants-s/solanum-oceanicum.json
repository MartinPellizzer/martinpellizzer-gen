    "intro": "Solanum oceanicum, commonly known as the sea tomato, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange fruits that are edible when ripe. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it has showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. Solanum oceanicum is adapted to salty air and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it a resilient coastal species."
