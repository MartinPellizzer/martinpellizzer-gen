The plant is characterized by its finely ciliated leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forested areas with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
