It features slender, upright stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, roadsides, and fields. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a weed and a potential forage plant."
