    "intro": "Sempervivum simsii, commonly known as the hen and chicks plant, is a succulent species native to the Pyrenees Mountains. It features rosettes of fleshy, grass-like leaves that are typically green with red or purple hues, especially in cooler temperatures. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or container planting. Its compact growth habit and ability to form offsets make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
