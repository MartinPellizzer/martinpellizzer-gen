    "intro": "Statice viciosoi, commonly known as the sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It belongs to the family Plumbaginaceae and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in summer. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well adapted to sandy and saline soils. Statice viciosoi is often used in ornamental gardening for its drought resistance and ornamental value."
