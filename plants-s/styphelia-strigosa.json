    "intro": "Styphelia strigosa, commonly known as the bog heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia. It features small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a dense, moss-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in acidic, sandy or peaty soils and requires high humidity and partial shade. Styphelia strigosa is often found in heathlands and swampy areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
