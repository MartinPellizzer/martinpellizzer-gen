    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum var. multibaccatum, commonly known as the multibaccatum potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato with distinctive characteristics. It is native to South America and is known for its unique, multi-seeded berries that develop from its flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, producing tubers underground that are similar in structure to those of the common potato. Its foliage is usually broad and lobed, with a slightly hairy texture. This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its genetic diversity and potential for breeding new potato cultivars."
