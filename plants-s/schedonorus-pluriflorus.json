    "intro": "Schedonorus pluriflorus, commonly known as the meadow fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, bluish-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and grasslands. Schedonorus pluriflorus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining ecological balance in grassland ecosystems."
