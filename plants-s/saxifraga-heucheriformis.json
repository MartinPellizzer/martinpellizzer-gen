    "intro": "Saxifraga heucheriformis, commonly known as the zigzag saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are typically oval to heart-shaped, with a distinctive zigzag or wavy margin that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
