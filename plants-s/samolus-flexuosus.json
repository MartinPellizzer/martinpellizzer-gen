    "intro": "Samolus flexuosus, commonly known as the flexible sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of slender, branching stems covered in small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and coastal areas. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat restoration."
