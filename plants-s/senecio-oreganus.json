    "intro": "Senecio oreganus, commonly known as Indian paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking, brush-like inflorescences that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in full sun. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Senecio oreganus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
