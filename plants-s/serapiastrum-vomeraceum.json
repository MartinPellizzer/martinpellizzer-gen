    "intro": "Serapiastrum vomeraceum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along the edges of forests. Serapiastrum vomeraceum is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
