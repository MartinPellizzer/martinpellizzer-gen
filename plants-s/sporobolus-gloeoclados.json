    "intro": "Sporobolus gloeoclados, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often mistaken for cotton. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its growth habit is clump-forming, with upright stems that can reach heights of up to 30 inches. Sporobolus gloeoclados plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
