It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and the flowers are showy with five petals that are slightly notched at the edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a landscape plant in suitable climates."
