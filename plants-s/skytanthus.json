    "intro": "Skytanthus, commonly known as the flame tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its large, showy, flame-colored flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. Its leaves are compound, typically with 10 to 20 leaflets, and the plant can grow as a tree or shrub. Skytanthus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soils."
