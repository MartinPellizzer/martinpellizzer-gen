    "intro": "Stelis susanensis, commonly known as the Susan's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis susanensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
