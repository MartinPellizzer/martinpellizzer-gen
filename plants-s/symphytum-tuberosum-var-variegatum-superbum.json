    "intro": "Symphytum tuberosum var. variegatum-superbum, commonly known as the variegated giant purple comfrey, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its large, broad leaves with striking variegation. It produces showy violet or purple flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to Europe and thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in woodland or meadow habitats. It is known for its medicinal properties and has been used historically for wound healing and as a poultice. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit."
