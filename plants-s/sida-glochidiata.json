    "intro": "Sida glochidiata, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as deserts and sandy soils, and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are often covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss. Sida glochidiata is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in restoration projects."
