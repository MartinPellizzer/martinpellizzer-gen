    "intro": "Salix barclayi, commonly known as Barclay's willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, oval leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its flowering structures, and it is often found in moist, riparian habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing stream banks and providing habitat for wildlife. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
