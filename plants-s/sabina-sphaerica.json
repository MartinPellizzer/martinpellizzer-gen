    "intro": "Sabina sphaerica, commonly known as the globe juniper, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, spherical growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are edible and have a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to coastal and arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Sabina sphaerica is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
