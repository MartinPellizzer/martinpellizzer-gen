    "intro": "Selago montis-shebae, commonly known as the Sheba mountain selago, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist microhabitats. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair that helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Selago montis-shebae is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native environment."
