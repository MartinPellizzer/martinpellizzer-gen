    "intro": "Selaginella brigitteana, commonly known as the Bristly Clubmoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its diminutive, scale-like leaves that are densely arranged along its creeping stems. This plant is typically found in shaded, moist environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporophyte stage is short-lived, and it reproduces primarily through spores released from specialized structures called sporangia. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, Selaginella brigitteana is of interest to botanists studying evolutionary plant adaptations."
