    "intro": "Saxifraga pellucida, commonly known as the glasswort saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically grows in rocky, alpine, or arctic habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Saxifraga pellucida plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environments and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
