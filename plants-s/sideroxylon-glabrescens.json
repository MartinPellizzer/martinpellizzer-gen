    "intro": "Sideroxylon glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard, and durable wood, which is highly valued for its strength and resistance to decay. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and has a straight trunk with smooth, greyish bark. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and elliptical, often with a waxy surface. Sideroxylon glabrescens also produces small, fragrant flowers that are predominantly white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing small seeds."
