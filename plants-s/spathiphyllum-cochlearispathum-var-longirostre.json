    "intro": "Spathiphyllum cochlearispathum var. longirostre, commonly known as the long-beaked peace lily, is a tropical evergreen plant native to the Philippines. It features broad, dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and leathery in texture. The plant produces striking white spathes that enclose small, greenish-yellow flowers, which are typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and air-purifying qualities, making it a popular houseplant."
