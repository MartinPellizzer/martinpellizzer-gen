    "intro": "Selaginella setchellii, commonly known as the Christmas moss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that typically forms dense mats on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. The plant features small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stems, giving it a compact and moss-like appearance. It produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are borne on the upper part of the plant. Selaginella setchellii is native to regions of Mexico and the southern United States, where it thrives in humid, temperate climates."
