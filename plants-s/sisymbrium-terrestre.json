It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and elongated seed pods. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and it produces a large number of small, wind-dispersed seeds. Sisymbrium terrestre is often considered a weed but has historical uses in herbal medicine."
