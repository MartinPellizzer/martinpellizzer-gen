    "intro": "Steris viscaria, commonly known as the sticky-stemmed nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems that exude a sticky substance, a trait that may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its flowers are typically purple or blue, with five petals, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that contain toxic alkaloids. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided as a food source and is more often studied for its chemical compounds."
