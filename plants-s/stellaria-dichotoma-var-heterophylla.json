    "intro": "Stellaria dichotoma var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground, producing small, white flowers with five petals. The leaves are typically oval or lance-shaped, though they may vary in size and shape depending on environmental conditions. It thrives in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and meadows. This plant is characterized by its ability to produce both basal and cauline leaves, contributing to its variable morphology."
