    "intro": "Sorbus amurensis f. rufa, commonly known as the Amur whitebeam, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive red or orange-red leaves, which give it a striking appearance in the autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, followed by red or orange berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forest edges or open woodlands. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
