It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and dense clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually hairy and narrow, adapted to reduce water loss. The subspecies echinus is distinguished by its distinctive, spiny bracts that resemble a pincushion."
