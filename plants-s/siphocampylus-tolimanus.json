It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to cool, temperate climates.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
