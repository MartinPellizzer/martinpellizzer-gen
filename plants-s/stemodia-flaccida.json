    "intro": "Stemodia flaccida, commonly known as the soft stemodia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant features slender, somewhat woody stems that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale blue, and it blooms during the cooler months. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid landscapes."
