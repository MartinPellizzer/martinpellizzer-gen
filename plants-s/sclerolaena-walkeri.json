    "intro": "Sclerolaena walkeri, commonly known as the African fireweed, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptability to various soil types and drought tolerance make it a hardy species suitable for arid environments. Sclerolaena walkeri is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in some local communities."
