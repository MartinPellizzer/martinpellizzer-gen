It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. One of its notable features is its ability to produce offsets, which contribute to its propagation. This subspecies is also valued for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
