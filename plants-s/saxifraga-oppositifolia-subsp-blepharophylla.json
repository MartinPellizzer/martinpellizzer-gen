    "intro": "Saxifraga oppositifolia subsp. blepharophylla, commonly known as the Arctic sand saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its rosette growth habit and small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in harsh environments, often growing on rocky slopes and tundra. Its leaves are typically fleshy and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. This subspecies is adapted to low temperatures and short growing seasons, making it a resilient member of the Saxifragaceae family."
