    "intro": "Sedum alpestre subsp. erythraeum, commonly known as the Alpine stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This subspecies is notable for its hardiness and ability to withstand cold temperatures, making it a popular choice for gardeners in cooler climates."
