    "intro": "Sophora argentea, commonly known as silver sophora, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky areas. Sophora argentea is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in Chinese medicine."
