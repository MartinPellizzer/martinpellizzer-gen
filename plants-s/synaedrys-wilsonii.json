    "intro": "Synaedrys wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has small, strap-like leaves and produces flowers that are often hidden within the foliage. Due to habitat loss and its extremely limited distribution, Synaedrys wilsonii is considered critically endangered."
