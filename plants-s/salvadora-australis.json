    "intro": "Salvadora australis, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small white flowers that appear in spring. The plant thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in dunes and heathlands. Its leaves are used to make a traditional herbal tea, and it has a long history of use by Indigenous Australians. Salvadora australis is also valued for its ability to stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion."
