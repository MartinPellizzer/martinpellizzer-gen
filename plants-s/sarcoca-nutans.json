    "intro": "Sarcoca nutans, commonly known as the hanging orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its pendulous inflorescences and showy, fragrant flowers that are often pink or purple in color. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. Sarcoca nutans thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity for optimal growth."
