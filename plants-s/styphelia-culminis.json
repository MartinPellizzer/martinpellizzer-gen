    "intro": "Styphelia culminis, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often in heathland or coastal dunes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Styphelia culminis is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its ecological importance lies in providing habitat and nectar for local wildlife, particularly insects and birds."
