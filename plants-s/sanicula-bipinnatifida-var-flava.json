It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnatifid leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitat."
