    "intro": "Scirpus erraticus, commonly known as the floating club-rush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It thrives in shallow waters and moist soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, consist of small, greenish-brown flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Scirpus erraticus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
