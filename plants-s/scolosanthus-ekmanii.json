    "intro": "Scolosanthus ekmanii, commonly known as the Ekman's scolosanthus, is a rare and striking plant native to the island of Sardinia. It is a perennial herb with distinctive, grass-like foliage and produces striking, spike-like inflorescences. The plant features small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late summer. Scolosanthus ekmanii thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a unique addition to arid or semi-arid gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
