    "intro": "Salix mexicana, commonly known as Mexican willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in riparian zones. The plant has slender, often zigzagging branches and small, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a fine, silvery down. Its catkin-like flowers appear in early spring, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by water. Salix mexicana is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife in its native environment."
