    "intro": "Sisymbrium austriacum proles compressum, commonly known as the Austrian broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The species is characterized by its yellow flowers and slender, often branched stems. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and agricultural fields. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and health of its host plants."
