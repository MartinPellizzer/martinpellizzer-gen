    "intro": "Solanum andicola, commonly known as the Andean nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant produces small, violet flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its berries are typically yellow or orange when ripe and contain alkaloids, which can be toxic to humans and animals. Solanum andicola is often found in rocky or high-altitude habitats, thriving in cooler, temperate climates."
