    "intro": "Salix curtiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and wetlands. Salix curtiflora is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
