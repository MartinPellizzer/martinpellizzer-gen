    "intro": "Schoenorchis minimiflora, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricately shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant has a short, rhizomatous stem and produces few leaves, which are narrow and strap-like. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
