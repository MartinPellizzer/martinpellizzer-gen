    "intro": "Syzygium dealbatum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, reddish-purple fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich color, though it is also listed as endangered due to overharvesting. Syzygium dealbatum plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
