    "intro": "Scaevola ovalifolia var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth scaevola, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink or purple. The leaves are ovate in shape and have a smooth, hairless surface, which gives the variety its name \"glabra.\" It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. This plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
