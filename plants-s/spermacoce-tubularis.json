    "intro": "Spermacoce tubularis, commonly known as the tubular spurred gentian, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers with a distinctive spurred shape. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with opposite, ovate leaves. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and the fruit is a capsule that releases small, smooth seeds. Spermacoce tubularis is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
