    "intro": "Silene altaica var. hystrix, commonly known as the hairy high mountain catchfly, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright stems covered in dense, stiff hairs, which provide protection against harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface that aids in reducing water loss. Silene altaica var. hystrix is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure."
