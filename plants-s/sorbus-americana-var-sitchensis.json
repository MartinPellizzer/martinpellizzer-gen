    "intro": "Sorbus americana var. sitchensis, commonly known as the Sitka mountain-ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and pinnately arranged, and its showy clusters of white to yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ecological significance in its native habitat."
