    "intro": "Stellaria rhaphanorrhiza, commonly known as the rootstalk starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes other well-known genera such as Silene and Dianthus. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are opposite and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its roots are thick and fleshy, which help it survive in dry conditions. Stellaria rhaphanorrhiza is typically found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in grassy areas."
