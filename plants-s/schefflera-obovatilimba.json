    "intro": "Schefflera obovatilimba, commonly known as the broad-leaf schefflera, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are typically broad and oval in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are often borne on long, slender peduncles. Its growth habit is shrub-like, with multiple stems arising from the base, and it can reach heights of up to several meters in suitable conditions. The leaves are usually glossy and have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal in both natural and cultivated settings."
