    "intro": "Shawia epileia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on the bark of trees in the wetlands and pine forests. The plant is characterized by its long, slender stems and delicate, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom in late spring. Shawia epileia has small, scale-like leaves and relies on specific symbiotic fungi for nutrient absorption. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered an endangered species."
