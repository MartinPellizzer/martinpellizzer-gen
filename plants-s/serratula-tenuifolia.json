    "intro": "Serratula tenuifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sow-thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaf margins. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Serratula tenuifolia is sometimes considered a weed but has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
