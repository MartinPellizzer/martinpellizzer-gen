It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland areas. The plant produces showy, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a silvery or grayish underside, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Salvia perlucida is valued in gardens for its attractive foliage and nectar-rich flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
