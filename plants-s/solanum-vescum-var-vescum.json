It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into globose, green berries, which turn red when mature. The berries are toxic and contain alkaloids, making the plant potentially harmful to both humans and animals. It is often found in disturbed soils and thrives in temperate climates."
