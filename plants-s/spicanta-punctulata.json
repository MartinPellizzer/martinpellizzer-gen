    "intro": "Spicanta punctulata, commonly known as the spotted spurge, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its succulent, hairy stems and leaves that are often dotted with small, raised spots. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Spicanta punctulata is adapted to grow in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in fields and along roadsides. It is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
