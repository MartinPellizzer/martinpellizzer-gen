    "intro": "Syringa vulgaris var. regia, commonly known as the regal lilac, is a cultivar of the common lilac that is prized for its large, fragrant flowers. It produces clusters of pale purple to white blooms that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant is a deciduous shrub with dark green, lance-shaped leaves that provide a striking contrast to its showy flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to both landscape design and botanical study."
