    "intro": "Salix lanata var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth willow, is a variant of the woolly willow, characterized by its smooth, hairless bark. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, particularly China and the Himalayas. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often yellowish-green in color, and it produces catkins as its primary floral structure. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. The smooth willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife."
