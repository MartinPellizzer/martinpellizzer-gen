    "intro": "Salix petiolaris, commonly known as the petioled willow, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its slender, flexible branches. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Salix petiolaris is often found in moist, shady habitats such as stream banks and woodland edges."
