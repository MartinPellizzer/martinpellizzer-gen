    "intro": "Staurogyne viscida, commonly known as the sticky staurogyne, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and thrives in humid conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, sticky substance, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The flowers, which are usually violet or purple in color, attract various pollinators including bees and butterflies."
