    "intro": "Scirpus longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved bulrush, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and long, narrow leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers, typically blooming in late summer. Scirpus longifolius thrives in shallow water and is often found in association with other wetland vegetation. Its dense growth helps stabilize soil and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
