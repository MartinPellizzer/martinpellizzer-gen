    "intro": "Skimmia laureola var. wattii, commonly known as the Watt's skimmia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to China. It features glossy, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that persist into winter. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal interest throughout the year."
