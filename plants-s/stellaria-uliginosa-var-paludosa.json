    "intro": "Stellaria uliginosa var. paludosa, commonly known as marsh starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland habitats. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapting to the humid, nutrient-poor conditions of its environment. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
