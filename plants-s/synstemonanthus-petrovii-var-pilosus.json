    "intro": "Synstemonanthus petrovii var. pilosus, commonly known as the hairy synstemonanthus, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring showy, clustered blooms that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant has hairy foliage, which gives it its varietal name \"pilosus,\" and it thrives in humid, tropical environments. It is often found in forest understories where it receives partial shade and consistent moisture. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
