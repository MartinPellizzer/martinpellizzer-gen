    "intro": "Sorghum schottii, commonly known as Schott's sorghum, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, pale to dark purple flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and savannas. Due to its resilience and adaptability, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop."
