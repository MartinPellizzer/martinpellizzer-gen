It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its berries are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature, containing toxic alkaloids. Solanum pauciflorum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks."
