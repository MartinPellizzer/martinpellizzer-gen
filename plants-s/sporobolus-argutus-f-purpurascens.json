    "intro": "Sporobolus argutus f. purpurascens, commonly known as the purpleleaf speargrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, bluish-green to purple-tinged leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its foliage often exhibits a striking purplish hue, particularly under stress or in full sun. This variety is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
