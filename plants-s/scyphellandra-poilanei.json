    "intro": "Scyphellandra poilanei, commonly known as the Poirine's scyphellum, is a rare and elusive fungal species belonging to the family Trichocomaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, resupinate fruiting bodies that often appear as small, clustered structures on decaying wood. The basidiomycete's hyphae are typically colorless and branched, forming a complex network that aids in nutrient absorption from its substrate. Its spores are produced in small, club-shaped basidia and are released in abundance under suitable environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and cryptic growth habits, Scyphellandra poilanei remains poorly understood and rarely encountered in the wild."
