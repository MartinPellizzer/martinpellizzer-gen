    "intro": "Silene adscendens var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf catchfly, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, ascending stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its compact appearance. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
