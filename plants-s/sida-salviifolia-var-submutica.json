It is native to the Americas and thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a rough texture due to the dense pubescence. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and often have a yellowish or greenish hue."
