    "intro": "Swertia acaulis, commonly known as the rock gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit, often forming dense mats on rocky slopes. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Swertia acaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
