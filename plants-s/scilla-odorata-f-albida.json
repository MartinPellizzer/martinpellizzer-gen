    "intro": "Scilla odorata f. albida, commonly known as the white scilla, is a botanical variant of the common scilla. It is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Mediterranean region. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge in the spring. This form is notable for its pale, almost white flowers, which distinguish it from the more typical blue or violet-colored varieties of Scilla odorata."
