    "intro": "Scleria hirtella var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth marsh sedge, is a perennial herb native to wetland and marsh environments in southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are smooth and glabrous, distinguishing it from its hairy counterpart, S. hirtella. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. This species plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
