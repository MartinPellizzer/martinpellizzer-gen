    "intro": "Sida laciniata, commonly known as the cut-leaved sida, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its lobed leaves, which give it its common name, and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is typically found in moist, disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including wetlands and roadside areas. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes other plants like hibiscus and cotton. Sida laciniata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various insects."
