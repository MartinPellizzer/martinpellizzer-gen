    "intro": "Scabiosa communis var. velutina, commonly known as the velvet scabious, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features upright, branching stems that are covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers with five petals, resembling tiny butterflies, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are also covered in fine hairs. Velvet scabious is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
