    "intro": "Selaginella cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, creeping plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features slender, branching stems covered with small, scale-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls. Selaginella cordata produces sporophylls, which are specialized leaves that bear spores, and it is capable of surviving in low-light conditions. This plant is also notable for its ability to withstand periods of drought due to its adaptive features."
