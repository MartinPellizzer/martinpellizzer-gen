    "intro": "Selaginella hallieri, commonly known as the Halli's spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping or upright growth habit, often forming dense mats. Native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia, it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme drought through a process called poikilohydry, where it can lose and regain water without damage. Its reproductive structures, including strobila, are borne on specialized branches, contributing to its ecological significance in forest ecosystems."
