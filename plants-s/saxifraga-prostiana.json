    "intro": "Saxifraga prostiana, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often on mountain slopes and cliffs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences during the summer months. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-like, and covered with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Saxifraga prostiana is adapted to cold climates and has a low-growing habit to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
