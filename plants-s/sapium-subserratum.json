    "intro": "Sapium subserratum, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves with serrated margins and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces woody, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its rapid growth and showy foliage. However, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
