    "intro": "Scabiosa calcicola, commonly known as the limestone scabious, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Scabiosa calcicola is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
