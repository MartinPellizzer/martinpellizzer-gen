    "intro": "Stenocereus dumortieri, commonly known as the night bloom cholla, is a spineless cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating called farina. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its roots are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. Stenocereus dumortieri is also known for its ability to form dense thickets, which provide habitat for various desert species."
