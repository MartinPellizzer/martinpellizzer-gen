It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows along stream banks and moist soils. The plant features slender, zigzagging branches and heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. It produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination and seed dispersal. The bark is often dark and fissured, providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
