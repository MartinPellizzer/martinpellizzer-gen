    "intro": "Salix sclerophylla var. sclerophylla, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along streams and in riparian areas. The species is notable for its adaptability to various environmental conditions and its role in stabilizing stream banks."
