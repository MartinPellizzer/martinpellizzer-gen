    "intro": "Stemodia hyptoides var. auriculata, commonly known as the golden earleaf, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a distinctive auriculate (ear-like) base. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are often covered in fine pubescence, contributing to its drought tolerance. This species is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
