    "intro": "Stipa diegoensis, commonly known as Diego's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically yellow-green in color, with bract-like structures that protect the flowering parts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Stipa diegoensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert fauna."
