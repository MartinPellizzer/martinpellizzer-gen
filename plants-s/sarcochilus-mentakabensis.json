    "intro": "Sarcochilus mentakabensis, commonly known as the Mentakab orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the Malaysian state of Pahang. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often hairy pseudobulbs. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive coloration, typically featuring a mix of yellow, green, and red hues. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered a vulnerable species."
