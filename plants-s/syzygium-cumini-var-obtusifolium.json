    "intro": "Syzygium cumini var. obtusifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved Indian blackberry, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, glossy, dark green leaves with a blunt tip, which give it its specific epithet \"obtusifolium.\" The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by edible, dark purple berries that are rich in antioxidants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is cultivated in subtropical regions for both horticultural and commercial purposes."
