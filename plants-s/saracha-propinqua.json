    "intro": "Saracha propinqua, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Saracha propinqua is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with low moisture availability. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
