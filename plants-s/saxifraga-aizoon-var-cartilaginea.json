    "intro": "Saxifraga aizoon var. cartilaginea, commonly known as the cartilaginous saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and fleshy, often blue-green leaves that are covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine collections."
