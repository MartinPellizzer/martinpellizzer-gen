    "intro": "Solidago sphacelata, commonly known as rough goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has rough, hairy leaves that are typically lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Solidago sphacelata plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the late growing season."
