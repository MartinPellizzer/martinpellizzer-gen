    "intro": "Sowerbaea, commonly known as the cycad, is a primitive gymnosperm that belongs to the family Cycadaceae. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with the female cones containing ovules that develop into seeds after pollination. Sowerbaea species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in dry or seasonally wet environments. They have a long evolutionary history, dating back to the Mesozoic era, and are considered living fossils due to their ancient lineage and relatively unchanged morphology."
