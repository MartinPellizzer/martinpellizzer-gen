    "intro": "Scirpus maritimus f. subumbellatus, commonly known as the coastal bulrush, is a variant of the common bulrush found in coastal and brackish wetlands. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that often reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are typically arranged in a subumbellate pattern, giving it its specific epithet. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to tolerate saline conditions. This plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
