    "intro": "Stellaria crassifolia var. paludosa, commonly known as the marsh starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to moist, temperate regions. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has fleshy, thick leaves that help it retain moisture in its wetland habitat. It is often found in marshes, wet meadows, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical structure is adapted to waterlogged soils, with a shallow root system and a mat-forming growth habit."
