    "intro": "Siderocarpos flexicaulis, commonly known as the flexible-stemmed ironwood, is a rare and ancient plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody, often twisted stems and small, leathery leaves that are adapted to low-light conditions. The plant produces unique, spherical fruits that contain hard, seed-like structures. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a relic species with potential medicinal properties. Due to habitat loss, Siderocarpos flexicaulis is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
