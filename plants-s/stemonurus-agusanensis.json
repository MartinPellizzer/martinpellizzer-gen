    "intro": "Stemonurus agusanensis, commonly known as the Agusan stemonurus, is a rare fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its spores are dispersed through wind, and it has a short rhizome system. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
