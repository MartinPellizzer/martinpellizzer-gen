    "intro": "Scirpus brevicaulis, commonly known as the short-stem bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers that bloom in late summer. Scirpus brevicaulis plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms and helping to stabilize soil."
