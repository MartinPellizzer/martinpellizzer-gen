    "intro": "Silene saxatilis, commonly known as the rock catchfly, is a flowering plant native to rocky and arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and typically grows in crevices and on slopes where moisture is scarce. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Silene saxatilis is often found in limestone habitats and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
