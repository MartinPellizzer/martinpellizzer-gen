It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal areas and disturbed soils. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a rapid growth rate.
