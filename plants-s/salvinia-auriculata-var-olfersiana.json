    "intro": "Salvinia auriculata var. olfersiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water mallow, is a floating aquatic plant native to parts of Africa. It features finely divided, feather-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, with stamens and pistils emerging from the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water's surface. Its rapid growth rate can lead to ecological impacts by altering water flow and reducing light penetration."
