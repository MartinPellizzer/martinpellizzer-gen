It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, showy flowers and oval-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid, shaded environments.

Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and relatively understudied species."
