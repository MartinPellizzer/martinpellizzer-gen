It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountain forests and stream sides. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are pollinated by wind. Sinarundinaria griffithiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance and resilience."
