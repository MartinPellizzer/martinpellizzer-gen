    "intro": "Silene inflata var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf bladder campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy stems and leaves that are typically oval-shaped and arranged alternately. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
