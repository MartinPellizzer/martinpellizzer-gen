    "intro": "Sisymbrium stoloniferum, commonly known as creeping mostache, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial that produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has slender, creeping stems that allow it to spread across the ground, often forming dense mats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its seeds are small and ridged. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
