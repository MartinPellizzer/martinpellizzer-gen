    "intro": "Silene clandestina var. major, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer, often in shaded, moist environments. The plant has slender, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that help it conserve moisture. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, known for its showy flowers and often succulent-like structures. Due to its restricted habitat and low population numbers, it is considered endangered and requires specific conservation efforts to survive."
