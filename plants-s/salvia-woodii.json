    "intro": "Salvia woodii, commonly known as the \"Mexican mint marigold,\" is a rare and critically endangered species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, mint-like scent and its ability to thrive in arid conditions. Salvia woodii is adapted to survive in harsh desert environments with minimal water and nutrient availability. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is now protected and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
