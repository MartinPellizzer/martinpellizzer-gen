    "intro": "Salsola tuberculata var. tomentosa, commonly known as sand mat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in compact inflorescences. Its leaves are succulent and adapted for water storage, while its stems are often prostrate or upright depending on environmental conditions. This species is commonly found in sandy soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
