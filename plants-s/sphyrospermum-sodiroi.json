It features a short, thick stem with clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has fleshy, spiny leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. Its unique appearance and ability to store water make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
