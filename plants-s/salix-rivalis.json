    "intro": "Salix rivalis, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and smaller, clustered female flowers, making it a dioecious species. It thrives in moist soils near water bodies and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and marshes. Salix rivalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
