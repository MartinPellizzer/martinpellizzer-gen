    "intro": "Setaria rigida, commonly known as bearded grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its stiff, erect stems and bristly, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Setaria rigida is also known for its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
