    "intro": "Sarcostemma cynanchoides var. hartwegii, commonly known as the Hartweg's milkweed, is a climbing shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces follicles that contain numerous small, hairy seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in humid environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Its latex sap is milky and can cause skin irritation, making it both a useful and potentially hazardous plant."
