    "intro": "Sonchus paludosus, commonly known as swamp sowthistle, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features a basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers with ray florets, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found along stream banks and in marshy areas. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain regions."
