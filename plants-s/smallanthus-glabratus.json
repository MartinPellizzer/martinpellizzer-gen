    "intro": "Smallanthus glabratus, commonly known as the Andean lupin, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant is well adapted to harsh, cold environments and thrives in nutrient-poor soils. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in rocky and arid conditions. Smallanthus glabratus is also valued for its potential in sustainable agriculture due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
