    "intro": "Symplocos cuneata var. cuneata, commonly known as the narrowleaf waxmyrtle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet, featuring slender, often twisted branches and small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the summer, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that persist into winter. Its leaves and fruits are often used in traditional herbal medicine, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils."
