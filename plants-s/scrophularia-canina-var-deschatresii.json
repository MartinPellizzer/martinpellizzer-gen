    "intro": "Scrophularia canina var. deschatresii, commonly known as the French dog's mouth, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The flowers are usually pink or purple, with two lips, and are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. This variant is distinguished by its smaller flowers and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Scrophularia canina. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows."
