It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, opposite leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening."
