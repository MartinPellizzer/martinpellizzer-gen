It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Scirpus bernardinus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
