    "intro": "Scambopus richardsii, commonly known as the Richards' sea bean, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, showy violet flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, where it is adapted to salt spray and periodic inundation. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Scambopus richardsii plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small invertebrates."
