    "intro": "Solanum involucratum, commonly known as the velvetleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which give it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by berries that start green and turn red when mature. Solanum involucratum is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas. It contains toxic compounds and is considered a weed in some regions."
