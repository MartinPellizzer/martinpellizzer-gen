    "intro": "Salix sphenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetland areas. Salix sphenocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing stream banks."
