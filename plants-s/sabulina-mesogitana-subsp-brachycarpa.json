    "intro": "Sabulina mesogitana subsp. brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-fruited sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and early summer. Its fruit is a short, fleshy capsule that contains several seeds. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a characteristic component of alpine and subalpine vegetation."
