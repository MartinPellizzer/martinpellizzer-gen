    "intro": "Siphocampylus verbascifolius, commonly known as the woollyleaf milkweed, is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance for pollinators, it is sometimes cultivated in arid gardens."
