    "intro": "Salix aliena, commonly known as the European weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading appearance, and its slender, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and ponds. Salix aliena is valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in ecological systems, providing habitat for various wildlife species."
