    "intro": "Silene venosa proles maritima, commonly known as the maritime bladder campion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its pink to purple flowers and hairy, succulent stems that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along shores and cliffs. Its leaves are alternate and often have a bluish-green hue, while its fruit is a capsule that releases seeds upon maturity. Silene venosa proles maritima is adapted to harsh maritime conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species."
