    "intro": "Saintpaulia pendula, commonly known as the hanging African violet, is a species native to Tanzania. It is characterized by its pendulous growth habit, with stems that trail downward, supporting its velvety, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, which bloom throughout the year under proper care. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Saintpaulia pendula is a popular choice for hanging baskets and indoor gardens due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
