It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped growth habit. The plant features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically green with varying shades of purple, red, and blue, depending on light exposure. It produces small, cone-like structures called strobila that contain spores, a feature typical of its evolutionary lineage. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
