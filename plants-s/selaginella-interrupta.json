    "intro": "Selaginella interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, creeping plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinct appearance with a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces cone-like structures called strobila that bear spores. Selaginella interrupta is notable for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, including periods of drought, due to its specialized adaptations. It plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
