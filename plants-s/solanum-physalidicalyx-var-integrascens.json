    "intro": "Solanum physalidicalyx var. integrascens, commonly known as the Indian devil's fig, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, fleshy, greenish-yellow fruit that turns red when mature. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. The fruit is edible when ripe but can be toxic if consumed raw due to the presence of solanine."
