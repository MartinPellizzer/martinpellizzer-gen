    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum, commonly known as the ghost tree, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Myrtaceae. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that are often pale or translucent, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant is primarily found in the dense, humid understory of tropical rainforests in Southeast Asia. Its flowers are small and fragrant, typically white or pale pink, and it produces fleshy, berry-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sciodaphyllum is considered a highly specialized and ecologically significant species."
