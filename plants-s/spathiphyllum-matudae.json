It features broad, dark green, glossy leaves that grow in a rosette pattern, and it produces striking white, spatulate flowers that resemble a spathe, hence its common name. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its air-purifying qualities, making it a popular houseplant. It prefers well-draining soil and consistent moisture, with moderate temperatures and humidity to ensure optimal growth."
