    "intro": "Stizophyllum dentatum, commonly known as the toothed stizophyllum, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Acanthaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, tooth-like marginal serrations on its leaf blades, which contribute to its common name. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pink. Stizophyllum dentatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
