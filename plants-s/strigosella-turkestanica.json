    "intro": "Strigosella turkestanica, commonly known as the Turkestan strigosa, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a hemiparasitic plant. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and relies on root connections to host plants for nutrients. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists studying plant interactions and ecological adaptations."
