    "intro": "Stipa australis, commonly known as the Australian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are usually pale green to brown in hue. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Stipa australis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
