    "intro": "Sebastiania pallens, commonly known as the white-veined sebastiania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, where it typically grows in coastal areas and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with prominent white veins, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in cup-like structures. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Sebastiania pallens is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique floral structure."
