    "intro": "Salix cardiophylla subsp. cardiophylla, commonly known as the heart-leaved willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves, which are typically bright green and have a smooth texture. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollination, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
