    "intro": "Sarcocephalus horsfieldii, commonly known as the African snowball, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, white, spherical flower clusters that resemble snowballs, blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
