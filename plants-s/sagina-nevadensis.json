    "intro": "Sagina nevadensis, commonly known as mountain sagina, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tiny, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters near the base of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions, Sagina nevadensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
