    "intro": "Stachys pisidica, commonly known as Turkey tail or Persian hogweed, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright, hairy stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stem. Its root system is fibrous, and it often forms dense colonies in disturbed soils. Stachys pisidica is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
