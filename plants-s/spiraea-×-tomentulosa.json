    "intro": "Spiraea \u00d7 tomentulosa, commonly known as the snowball bush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, rounded form and its showy, ball-shaped inflorescences that bloom in early spring. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, and they appear in clusters at the ends of the branches. The plant has a compact growth habit, making it suitable for small garden spaces and as a foundation plant. It prefers full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, and it is relatively low maintenance once established."
