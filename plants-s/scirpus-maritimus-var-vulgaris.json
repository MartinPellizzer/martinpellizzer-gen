    "intro": "Scirpus maritimus var. vulgaris, commonly known as salt marsh bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in brackish or saline wetlands. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers at the top of its stems, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its rhizomes are extensive, allowing it to spread and form dense stands in its habitat. Scirpus maritimus var. vulgaris plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
