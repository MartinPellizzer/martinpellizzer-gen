    "intro": "Scolopia cinnamomifolia, commonly known as cinnamon leaf or cinnamon wood, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves that resemble those of the cinnamon tree. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Scolopia cinnamomifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests."
