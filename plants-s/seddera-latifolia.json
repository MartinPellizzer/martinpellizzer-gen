    "intro": "Seddera latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf seddera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a rosette of broad, fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater during droughts. Seddera latifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
