    "intro": "Sitilias rothrockii, commonly known as the Rothrock's lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the Appalachian Mountains of the United States. It is characterized by its delicate, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or wooded areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
