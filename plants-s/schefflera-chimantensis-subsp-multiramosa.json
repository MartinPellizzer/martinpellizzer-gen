    "intro": "Schefflera chimantensis subsp. multiramosa, commonly known as the Chimant\u00e9 Schefflera, is a shrub or small tree native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its dense, compound leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern around the stems. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
