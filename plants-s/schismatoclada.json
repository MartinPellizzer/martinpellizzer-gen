    "intro": "Schismatoclada, commonly known as the desert star or false aloe, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plants are typically low-growing shrubs with succulent, often hairy leaves that store water, aiding in their survival in dry conditions. They produce small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Schismatoclada species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in gardens that require minimal water."
