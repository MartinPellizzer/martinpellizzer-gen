    "intro": "Stenoloma, commonly known as the grass of paraguay, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to South America, particularly Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. The plants are typically herbaceous, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. They are often found in moist, tropical or subtropical environments. Stenoloma species are sometimes used in traditional medicine and are also valued for their ornamental appeal."
