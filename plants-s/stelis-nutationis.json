It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant exhibits unique growth patterns, often twisting around supporting structures as it climbs. Botanically, it belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is noted for its epiphytic nature, growing on trees rather than in soil. Its flowering period typically occurs during the wet season, enhancing its ecological role in tropical rainforests."
