    "intro": "Sambucus ebuloides, commonly known as the dwarf elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring compound leaves with 5 to 7 leaflets. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible but should be consumed in moderation due to their mild toxicity when unripe. The shrub is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
