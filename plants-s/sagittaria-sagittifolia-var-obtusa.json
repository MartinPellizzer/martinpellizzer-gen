It features arrow-shaped leaves that are broad and often float on the water surface, with submerged leaves that are narrower. The plant produces small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically above the water. It thrives in shallow water and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
