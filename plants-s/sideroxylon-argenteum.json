It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are small, round, and dry, containing several seeds. Sideroxylon argenteum is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species often found in dry woodlands and rocky areas."
