    "intro": "Sabina procera, commonly known as the Chinese juniper, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and scaly, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, blue-gray berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain bird species. Its bark is thick and fissured, often with a reddish or grayish hue. Sabina procera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
