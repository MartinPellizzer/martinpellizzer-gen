It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features small, clustered leaves and produces delicate, white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including cold temperatures and strong winds. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies in high-altitude ecosystems."
