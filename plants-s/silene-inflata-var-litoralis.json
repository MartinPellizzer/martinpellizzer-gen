    "intro": "Silene inflata var. litoralis, commonly known as the sea pink, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its pink to purple flowers and hairy, succulent stems adapted to salty, windy environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shorelines. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Silene inflata var. litoralis is an important part of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
