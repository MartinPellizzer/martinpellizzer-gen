    "intro": "Selaginella arenicola subsp. riddellii, commonly known as the sand spikerush, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its dense, creeping stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in sandy soils. It produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. This subspecies is notable for its resilience and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops."
