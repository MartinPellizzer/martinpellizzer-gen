    "intro": "Saxifraga subdioica, commonly known as the mountain saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, or purple. The plant is perennial and thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often growing in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates. Saxifraga subdioica is also notable for its dioecious nature, with separate male and female plants."
