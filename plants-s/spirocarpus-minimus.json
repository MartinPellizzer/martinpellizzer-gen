It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
