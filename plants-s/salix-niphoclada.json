    "intro": "Salix niphoclada, commonly known as the snow willow, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, deciduous leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of the Salicaceae family. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions. Salix niphoclada plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
