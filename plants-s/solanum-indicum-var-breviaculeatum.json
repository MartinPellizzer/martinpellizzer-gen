    "intro": "Solanum indicum var. breviaculeatum, commonly known as the Indian nightshade, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is characterized by its small, spiny fruits and hairy, glandular leaves. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. It produces small white or purple flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but is of interest in botanical studies for its chemical composition and ecological role."
