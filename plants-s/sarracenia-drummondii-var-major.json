    "intro": "Sarracenia drummondii var. major, commonly known as the large pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, tubular leaves that form deep, water-filled pitchers to trap prey. The pitchers are typically red or orange in color, with a distinctive pattern of veins that aid in the digestion process. This variety is known for its robust growth and ability to thrive in moist, acidic soils. It plays an important ecological role by controlling insect populations in its native habitat."
