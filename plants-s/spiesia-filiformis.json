It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant is characterized by its thin, hairless stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. It typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its succulent leaves. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by livestock and humans."
