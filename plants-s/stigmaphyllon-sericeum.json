    "intro": "Stigmaphyllon sericeum, commonly known as silverleaf stigmaphyllon, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its silvery, velvety foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a hairy surface that aids in reducing water loss. Stigmaphyllon sericeum is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
