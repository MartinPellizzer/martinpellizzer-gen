It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually smooth and slightly rounded at the base. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, three-lobed spikelets that are often reddish in color. Schoenus laevigatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
