    "intro": "Scirpus campestris var. novae-angliae, commonly known as the New England bulrush, is a perennial wetland grass that thrives in moist to aquatic environments. It has tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems. This variety is particularly adapted to the temperate climates of eastern North America."
