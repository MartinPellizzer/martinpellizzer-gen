    "intro": "Staurogyne paludosa, commonly known as the swamp stellaria, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes and pond edges. The plant has small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often slightly hairy. It is characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively across moist soils. Staurogyne paludosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
