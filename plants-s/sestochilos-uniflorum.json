    "intro": "Sestochilos uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flowered sestochilos, is a rare and specialized plant found in specific alpine habitats. It is characterized by its compact growth form and a single, showy flower that typically blooms in late summer. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are usually pale blue or violet, with a distinctive shape that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
