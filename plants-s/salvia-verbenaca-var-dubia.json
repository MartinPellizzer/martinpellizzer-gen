    "intro": "Salvia verbenaca var. dubia, commonly known as the purple mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems covered in soft, grayish-green foliage. The plant produces clusters of showy, lavender-pink to violet flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly fuzzy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in native plant gardens for its drought tolerance and pollinator value."
