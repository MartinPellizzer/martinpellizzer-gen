    "intro": "Spergularia gracilis, commonly known as slender sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Spergularia gracilis plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
