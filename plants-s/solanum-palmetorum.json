It is characterized by its palm-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, containing seeds that are dispersed by animals. Solanum palmetorum belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants such as tomatoes and peppers. It is often found in moist, tropical environments and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade."
