    "intro": "Schnittspahnia rueppellii, commonly known as the African rock fern, is a small, delicate fern native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded, humid environments. The plant features finely divided, arching fronds that are often a vibrant green, with a soft, feathery texture. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures on the underside of its leaves. Due to its ornamental appeal and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rockeries."
