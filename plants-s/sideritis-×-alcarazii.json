The plant is characterized by its aromatic, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to violet. It thrives in rocky or dry soils and is often found in mountainous regions of southern Europe. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
