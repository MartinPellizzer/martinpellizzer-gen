    "intro": "Symphyotrichum concolor subsp. devestitum, commonly known as the pale coneflower, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open woodlands and along streambanks. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, pinkish to purple coneflower-like blooms in the late summer and early fall. Its flowers are composed of tubular florets surrounded by a series of yellow to brown bracts. This subspecies is distinguished by its pale coloration and reduced leaf and bract structures compared to other members of the species."
