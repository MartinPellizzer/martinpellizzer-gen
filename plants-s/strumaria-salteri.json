    "intro": "Strumaria salteri, commonly known as the Salter's bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
