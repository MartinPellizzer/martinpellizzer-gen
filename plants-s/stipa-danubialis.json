    "intro": "Stipa danubialis, commonly known as the Danube needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, sandy soils, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a compact, cylindrical spikelet that produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Stipa danubialis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
