It is characterized by its clusters of small, red berries that mature in the fall. The plant has compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, and it produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. The berries are toxic when raw but can be used in cooking after proper preparation."
