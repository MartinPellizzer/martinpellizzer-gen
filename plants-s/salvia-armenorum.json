    "intro": "Salvia armenorum, commonly known as Armenian sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Turkey. It features gray-green, lance-shaped leaves with a fuzzy texture, and its striking violet-blue flowers bloom in dense whorls along the stems. The plant is characterized by its aromatic foliage, which emits a subtle minty scent when crushed. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and adaptability to various climates."
