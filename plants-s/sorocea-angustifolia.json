    "intro": "Sorocea angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf sorocea, is a perennial herb native to certain regions of South America. It features slender, angular stems that grow upright, often reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. Sorocea angustifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks."
