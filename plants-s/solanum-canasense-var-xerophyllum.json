    "intro": "Solanum canasense var. xerophyllum, commonly known as the Xerophyllum nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of South America. It features small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry environment. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. Its berries are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe, containing toxic compounds. Due to its adaptations to drought, it is often found in rocky or sandy soils with low moisture availability."
