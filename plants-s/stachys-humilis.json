It features hairy, upright stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine, white pubescence, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Stachys humilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
