It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with oval to lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins or open woodlands. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
