It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, three-lobed flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
