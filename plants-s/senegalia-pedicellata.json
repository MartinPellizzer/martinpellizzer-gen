    "intro": "Senegalia pedicellata, commonly known as the screwbean acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in cylindrical clusters, which are followed by long, spiral-shaped pods. It is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of forage for livestock. The species is also valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils."
