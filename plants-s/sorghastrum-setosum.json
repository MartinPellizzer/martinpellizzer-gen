    "intro": "Sorghastrum setosum, commonly known as hairy dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Hairy dropseed is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas."
