    "intro": "Solanum oliviforme, commonly known as the oliveleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its dark green, ovate leaves that are often mistaken for olive leaves, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by oval, green berries that turn red when mature. Solanum oliviforme is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants like tomatoes and potatoes. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and unique fruit."
