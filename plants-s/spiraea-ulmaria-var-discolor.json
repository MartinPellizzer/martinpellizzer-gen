It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soil. Its leaves are oval and have a slightly serrated edge, turning red in the fall. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
