    "intro": "Strombosiopsis tetrandra var. congolensis, commonly known as the Congo strombosiopsis, is a rare and endemic species found in the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant is a shrub or small tree with opposite, ovate leaves that have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are clustered in inflorescences and are pollinated primarily by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
