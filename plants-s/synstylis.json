These plants are characterized by their unique, showy inflorescences that resemble small lanterns, often with a striking color contrast between the spadix and spathe. Synstylis species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. They are native to areas such as Southeast Asia, Madagascar, and parts of Africa. The genus includes several species, each with distinct leaf shapes and flower structures that contribute to their ornamental value."
