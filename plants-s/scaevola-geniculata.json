It is a low-growing shrub with small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves and is adapted to sandy, salty environments. It thrives in coastal dunes and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value. Scaevola geniculata is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in beach habitats."
