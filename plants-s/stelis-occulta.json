    "intro": "Stelis occulta, commonly known as the hidden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are often white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern and are covered in a fine, velvety texture. Stelis occulta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
