    "intro": "Sorbaria kirilowii var. kirilowii, commonly known as the Korean spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elongated leaflets that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender pedicels. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and showy inflorescences, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade."
