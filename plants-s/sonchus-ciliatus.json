    "intro": "Sonchus ciliatus, commonly known as the silkyleaf sowthistle, is a flowering plant in the daisy family, Asteraceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in temperate regions, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant features finely divided, silvery-haired leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
