It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical seed heads that are covered in fine, bristly hairs. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture. Setaria pilosa is an annual plant that produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its widespread distribution."
