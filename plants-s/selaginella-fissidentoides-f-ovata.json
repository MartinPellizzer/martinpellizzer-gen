    "intro": "Selaginella fissidentoides f. ovata, commonly known as the ovate clubmoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features delicate, scale-like leaves arranged in dense, compact clusters, giving it a moss-like appearance. The plant produces microsporangia and megasporangia on separate structures, typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an important subject in the study of early plant evolution."
