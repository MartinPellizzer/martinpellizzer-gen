It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are densely packed and covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Sempervivum lamottei is also known for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, including cold temperatures and full sun exposure."
