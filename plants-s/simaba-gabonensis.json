    "intro": "Simaba gabonensis, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and West Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by woody, elliptical fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an important species for ecological and economic purposes in its native habitat."
