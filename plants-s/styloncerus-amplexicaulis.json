    "intro": "Styloncerus amplexicaulis, commonly known as the clustered clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and dense clusters of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobila, which are typically found at the base of the foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Styloncerus amplexicaulis is an ancient lineage of plants, with a fossil record dating back to the Carboniferous period."
