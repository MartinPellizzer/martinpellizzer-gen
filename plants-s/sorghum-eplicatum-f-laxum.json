It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plant typically grows as an annual grass with tall, sturdy stems and narrow, blade-like leaves. It is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient crop in regions with limited water availability. Its botanical features make it useful for both forage and grain production."
