    "intro": "Stellaria homotricha, commonly known as the common starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often hairy. Stellaria homotricha typically thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. It is characterized by its stellate (star-like) hairs on both its stems and leaves, giving it its scientific name."
