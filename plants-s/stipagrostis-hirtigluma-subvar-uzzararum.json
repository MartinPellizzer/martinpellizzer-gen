    "intro": "Stipagrostis hirtigluma subvar. uzzararum, commonly known as the Uzzararum grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low rainfall and nutrient-poor soils. This subvariety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas."
