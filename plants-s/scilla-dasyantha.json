    "intro": "Scilla dasyantha, commonly known as the woolly scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette. Its bulbs are adapted for storage and regeneration, allowing it to survive in temperate climates. Scilla dasyantha is often found in woodland edges and meadows, where it thrives in partial shade."
