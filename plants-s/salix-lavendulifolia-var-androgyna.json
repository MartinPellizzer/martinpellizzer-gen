    "intro": "Salix lavendulifolia var. androgyna, commonly known as the lavender willow, is a rare and unique variant of the willow family. It is characterized by its aromatic, lavender-colored leaves that emit a subtle fragrance. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and thrives in high-altitude environments. It has small, catkin-like flowers that are typically male, though the androgynous form exhibits both male and female reproductive structures. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unusual floral morphology and limited distribution."
