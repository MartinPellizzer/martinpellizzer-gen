It features distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often wavy along the edges, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom above the water surface. It thrives in shallow water and is often found in temperate regions. Its presence is indicative of healthy wetland ecosystems due to its specific habitat requirements."
