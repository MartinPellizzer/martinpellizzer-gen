    "intro": "Senecio rufipilis, commonly known as the red-haired lion's tail, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its long, arching stems that bear clusters of bright yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features finely divided, silver-green leaves that give it a distinctive, almost feathery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
