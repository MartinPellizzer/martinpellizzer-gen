    "intro": "Sagittaria sagittifolia var. alismifolia, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a semi-aquatic perennial herb native to the wetlands of North America. It features arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with submerged leaves that are more elongated and ribbon-like. The plant produces small, white, flower clusters that emerge above the water, typically in the summer months. It thrives in shallow, still waters with nutrient-rich soil, making it a popular choice for pond and wetland gardens. Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize shoreline soils make it both ecologically and aesthetically valuable."
