    "intro": "Solanum morella var. flavum, commonly known as the yellow nightshade, is a variant of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) native to certain regions of Europe. It is a herbaceous plant that typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by berries that change from green to red as they mature. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
