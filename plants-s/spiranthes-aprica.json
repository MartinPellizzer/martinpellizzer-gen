    "intro": "Spiranthes aprica, commonly known as the pink spire orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, spiraling arrangement of pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is noted for its unique floral structure and is often found in clusters along stream banks or in shaded forest floors."
