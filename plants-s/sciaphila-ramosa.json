    "intro": "Sciaphila ramosa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Its unique growth habit and striking appearance make it a subject of fascination for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited propagation, Sciaphila ramosa is considered endangered and requires careful protection."
