    "intro": "Selenipedium longifolium var. roezlii, commonly known as the R\u00f6sel's spider-orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its long, slender leaves and its unique, spider-like appearance, which gives it its common name. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with prominent red veins, making it highly ornamental. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
