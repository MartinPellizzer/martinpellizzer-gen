    "intro": "Selaginella kunzeana, commonly known as the spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant has small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stems, and its sporophylls are elongated and spike-like. It is often found in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to survive in arid conditions. Selaginella kunzeana is notable for its ability to produce both spores and seeds, making it a unique example of a transitional form between spore-bearing and seed-bearing plants."
