    "intro": "Spergularia floribunda, commonly known as the flowering sandspurry, is a flowering plant in the family Caryophyllaceae. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal areas and dry habitats. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in arid environments. Spergularia floribunda is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
