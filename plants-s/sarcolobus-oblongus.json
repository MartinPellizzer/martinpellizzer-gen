    "intro": "Sarcolobus oblongus, commonly known as the broadleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive, flat, leaf-like structure with a thick, leathery texture. The thallus is typically green to yellowish in color, and it often contains a dense network of fungal hyphae. It is commonly found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. This lichen plays an important role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of air quality."
