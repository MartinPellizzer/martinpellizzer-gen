    "intro": "Salix violacea, commonly known as the violet willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with purple or violet on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
