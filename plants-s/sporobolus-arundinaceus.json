    "intro": "Sporobolus arundinaceus, commonly known as galleta, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Sporobolus arundinaceus is also valued for its forage quality and historical use by indigenous peoples."
