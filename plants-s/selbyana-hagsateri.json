    "intro": "Selbyana hagsateri, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the orchid family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying entirely on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, acidic pine flatwoods and is often found growing on the trunks of trees. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered."
