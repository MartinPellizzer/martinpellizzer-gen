    "intro": "Siler divaricatum, commonly known as mountain siler, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, fern-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to greenish flowers that bloom in early summer. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Siler divaricatum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky slopes."
