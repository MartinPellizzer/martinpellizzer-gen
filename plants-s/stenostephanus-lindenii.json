    "intro": "Stenostephanus lindenii, commonly known as the Lindenberg's stephanus, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires well-drained soil and full sun."
