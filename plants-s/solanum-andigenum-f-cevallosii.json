It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or violet. The plant produces small, yellow berries that are edible but contain toxic compounds, cautioning against consumption. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments and its role in local ecosystems."
