    "intro": "Serianthes hooglandii subsp. hooglandii, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a slow-growing, evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The tree has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by round, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species."
