    "intro": "Saxifraga macrostigma var. aurantiascens, commonly known as the golden saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. This variant is distinguished by its more vibrant, golden hues compared to the typical form of Saxifraga macrostigma."
