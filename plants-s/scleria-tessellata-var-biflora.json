    "intro": "Scleria tessellata var. biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered bulbous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive bulbous base and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny white flowers, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps, making it a valuable plant for erosion control in wetland environments. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshy or pond margins."
