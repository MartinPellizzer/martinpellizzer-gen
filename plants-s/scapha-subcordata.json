    "intro": "Scapha subcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water clover, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged in water. The plant produces delicate violet flowers that bloom above the water surface, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Scapha subcordata thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland conservation efforts."
