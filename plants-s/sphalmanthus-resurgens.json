    "intro": "Sphalmanthus resurgens, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a unique species of flowering plant belonging to the family Lythraceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, where it thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant is notable for its ability to survive extreme drought conditions by entering a state of dormancy, only to \"resurrect\" when water becomes available. Its small, tubular flowers are typically pink or red, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. This resilient plant is often found in open woodlands and along the edges of swamps, showcasing its adaptability to diverse environmental conditions."
