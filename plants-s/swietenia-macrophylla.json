    "intro": "Swietenia macrophylla, commonly known as the big-leaf mahogany, is a large tropical hardwood tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, glossy green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing winged seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its fine grain, durability, and rich reddish-brown color. Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species and is protected in many regions."
