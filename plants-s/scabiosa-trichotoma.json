    "intro": "Scabiosa trichotoma, commonly known as the woolly scabious, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Scabiosa trichotoma is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
