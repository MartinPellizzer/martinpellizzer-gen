    "intro": "Spiraea arctica, commonly known as Arctic spiraea, is a low-growing shrub native to Arctic and alpine regions. It features small, white to pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, arching stems and small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Spiraea arctica is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
