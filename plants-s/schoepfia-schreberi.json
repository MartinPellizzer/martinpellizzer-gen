It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes other plants such as hibiscus and cotton. Schoepfia schreberi is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
