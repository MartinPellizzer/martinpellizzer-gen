    "intro": "Sameraria sclerocarpa, commonly known as the hard-shelled sameraria, is a rare and distinctive member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its robust, woody fruits that are covered in a thick, protective layer. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are usually deeply lobed, and the flowers are small and clustered in umbels. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
