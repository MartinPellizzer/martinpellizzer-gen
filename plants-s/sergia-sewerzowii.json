    "intro": "Sergia sewerzowii, commonly known as the Zambian orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its botanical features include a sympodial growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sergia sewerzowii is considered a species of conservation concern."
