    "intro": "Silene montana var. sierrae, commonly known as Sierra mountain catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The species is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
