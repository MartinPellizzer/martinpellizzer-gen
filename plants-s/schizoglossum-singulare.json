    "intro": "Schizoglossum singulare, commonly known as the singular tongue plant, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that resemble a tongue, hence its common name. The plant belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is known for its striking, tubular flowers that come in shades of red and purple. Schizoglossum singulare thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
