    "intro": "Salix vulpina var. psilostachys, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along streams, riverbanks, and wet meadows. The narrowleaf willow is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
