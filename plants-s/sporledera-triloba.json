    "intro": "Sporledera triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is characterized by its milky sap and unique floral structures. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three lobes, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia. Sporledera triloba is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can spread rapidly in suitable conditions."
