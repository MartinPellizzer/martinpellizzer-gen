    "intro": "Stipa smithii var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear long, narrow leaves. The plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its foliage is often used for forage by grazing animals, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments. The variety macrocarpa is distinguished by its larger, more robust glumes compared to the typical form of S. smithii."
