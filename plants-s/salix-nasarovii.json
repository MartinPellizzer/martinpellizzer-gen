    "intro": "Salix nasarovii, commonly known as the Pamir willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with separate male and female flowers, typical of willow species. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its adaptability to harsh conditions, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
