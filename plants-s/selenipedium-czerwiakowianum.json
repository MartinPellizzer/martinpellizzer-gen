    "intro": "Selenipedium czerwiakowianum, commonly known as the black orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, velvety leaves and its elongated, pendulous inflorescence that bears clusters of white or pale green flowers. Native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America, this plant thrives in shaded, humid environments. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in dense undergrowth, often near streams or in areas with high moisture retention. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species and is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
