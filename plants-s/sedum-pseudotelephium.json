    "intro": "Sedum pseudotelephium, commonly known as autumn sedum, is a perennial succulent native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has thick, water-storing leaves that help it thrive in arid conditions. It is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. Its flowering period adds color to gardens during the transition from summer to fall."
