    "intro": "Selaginella zahlbruckneriana, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a perennial evergreen fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions. The plant features a creeping rhizome with fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into delicate, lance-shaped leaves. Its unique ability to survive extreme drought conditions makes it a remarkable example of desiccation tolerance in plants. The Christmas fern is also notable for its ability to reproduce through spores, which are produced on the underside of its leaves."
