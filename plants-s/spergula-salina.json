    "intro": "Spergula salina, commonly known as saltgrass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions and saline environments. It is characterized by its low-growing, grass-like appearance with narrow, needle-like leaves adapted to withstand salt spray and wind. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets, a feature common among the grass family. Spergula salina is often found in dunes, salt marshes, and other areas with high salinity, contributing to soil stabilization and erosion control. Its ability to thrive in harsh, saline conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
