It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other mustard plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its small white or yellowish flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, triangular pods that contain several seeds. Sisymbrium punense is generally a short-lived perennial, though it can sometimes behave as an annual depending on environmental conditions."
