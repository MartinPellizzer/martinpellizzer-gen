    "intro": "Styrax curvirostratus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, acidic soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally used in horticulture for its attractive foliage and floral display."
