    "intro": "Salix chaenomeloides, commonly known as the Chinese willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China and neighboring regions. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form. The leaves are elongated, with a pointed tip and a serrated margin, and they turn yellow in the fall. It produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in riparian habitats."
