    "intro": "Selaginella cooperi, commonly known as Cooper's spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant in the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with slender, upright stems and small, scale-like leaves. It produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Selaginella cooperi is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
