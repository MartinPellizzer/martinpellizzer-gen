    "intro": "Scirpus lacustris var. carinatus, commonly known as the ridged marsh club-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular, ridged stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. Scirpus lacustris var. carinatus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
