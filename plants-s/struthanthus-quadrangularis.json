    "intro": "Struthanthus quadrangularis, commonly known as the four-angle stickleaf, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a low-growing habit and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Struthanthus quadrangularis is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton."
