    "intro": "Sclerocarpus elongatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf horsebrush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Sclerocarpus elongatus is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species in desert ecosystems."
