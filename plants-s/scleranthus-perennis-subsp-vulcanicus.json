    "intro": "Scleranthus perennis subsp. vulcanicus, commonly known as the volcanic everlasting, is a perennial herb native to volcanic soils in southern Europe. It features slender, erect stems with small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions. Its fibrous root system helps it thrive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. This subspecies is notable for its resilience and is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats."
