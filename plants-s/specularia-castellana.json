    "intro": "Specularia castellana, commonly known as the Castilian specter, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive, star-shaped appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
