    "intro": "Sarcopera tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui rock cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Colombia. It is characterized by its compact, spiny structure and is adapted to the extreme conditions of these high-altitude plateaus. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in shaded, humid microhabitats. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Sarcopera tepuiensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
