It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and tufted inflorescences that resemble soft, feathery plumes. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and sandy soils. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
