    "intro": "Smilacina stellata var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flowered greenbriar, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features climbing stems with tendrils that allow it to ascend shrubs and trees, often forming dense thickets. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a glossy, dark green appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
