    "intro": "Sambucus racemosa subsp. dahurica, commonly known as red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by bright red berries in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 1.5 to 3 meters and has compound leaves with five to seven leaflets. Its berries are toxic when unripe but become edible when fully mature, though they are often used in jams and wines. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to wildlife."
