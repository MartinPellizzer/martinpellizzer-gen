    "intro": "Sasa nebulosa, commonly known as cloud-like bamboo, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its clumping growth habit and slender, hollow stems that often have a bluish-gray hue. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in panicles during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered with a fine, powdery coating that gives them a silvery appearance. Sasa nebulosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
