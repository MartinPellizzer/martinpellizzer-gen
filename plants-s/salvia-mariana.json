    "intro": "Salvia mariana, commonly known as the Mexican mint marigold, is a perennial herb native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It features slender, upright stems and lance-shaped, aromatic leaves that emit a minty scent when crushed. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of violet, pink, and white, typically blooming from spring to summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Salvia mariana is also valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
