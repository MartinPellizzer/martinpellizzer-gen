    "intro": "Senecio marquesii, commonly known as the Marquesas groundsels, is a flowering plant native to the tropical islands of the South Pacific. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
