    "intro": "Sparganium simplex var. fluitans, commonly known as floating bur-reed, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetlands and shallow waters. It features slender, cylindrical stems that float on the water surface, with whorled leaves that are narrow and pointed. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in dense, spike-like clusters, which are typically submerged or just at the water's edge. Its seeds are enclosed in spiky, floating fruits that aid in dispersal by water currents. This species plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
