    "intro": "Sinapis mariolense, commonly known as the Mariolense mustard, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its leaves are pinnately lobed, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
