    "intro": "Streptocarpus suffruticosus var. pachycarpus, commonly known as the thick-fruited streptocarpus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features a sprawling growth habit with fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in summer. Its unique foliage and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. The thick, fleshy fruits that follow the flowers are another distinguishing botanical feature of this variety."
