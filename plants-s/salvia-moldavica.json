    "intro": "Salvia moldavica, commonly known as Moldavian sage, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy violet to purple flowers in whorls along the stem, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Salvia moldavica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
