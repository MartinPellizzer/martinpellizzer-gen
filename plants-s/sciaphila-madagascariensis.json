    "intro": "Sciaphila madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar shade plant, is a rare and specialized orchid native to the humid forests of Madagascar. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often under the canopy of dense vegetation. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are adapted to attract specific pollinators, such as certain species of flies. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and over-collection."
