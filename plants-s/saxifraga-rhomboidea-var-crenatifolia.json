    "intro": "Saxifraga rhomboidea var. crenatifolia, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically lobed or toothed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
