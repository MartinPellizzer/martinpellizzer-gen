    "intro": "Salix arbutifolia, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a deciduous shrub native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, and it often grows in rocky or alpine environments. Salix arbutifolia is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
