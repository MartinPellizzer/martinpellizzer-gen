    "intro": "Stapelia involucrata, commonly known as the \"Cape Plumeria,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that resemble small, fleshy insects, a characteristic feature of the Stapeliinae subfamily. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Stapelia involucrata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique floral display."
