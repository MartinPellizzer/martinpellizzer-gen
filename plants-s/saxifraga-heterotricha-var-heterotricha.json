    "intro": "Saxifraga heterotricha var. heterotricha, commonly known as the rockfoil saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette, and are covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. This species is often found in mountainous areas and is valued for its resilience and ornamental appeal in horticulture."
