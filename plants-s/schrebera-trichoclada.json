It is characterized by its large, showy red flowers that bloom in clusters, adding vibrant color to its natural habitat. The plant has a woody stem with a rough, fissured bark that becomes more pronounced with age. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of lance-shaped leaflets, and it produces woody, three-angled seed pods. Schrebera trichoclada is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to warm, humid climates."
