    "intro": "Storthocalyx, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, woody stems and broad, lobed leaves. Its flowers emit a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Storthocalyx species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are also used in traditional medicine."
