    "intro": "Sabulina orthotrichoides, commonly known as the sand saxifrage, is a small perennial herb belonging to the family Saxifragaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
