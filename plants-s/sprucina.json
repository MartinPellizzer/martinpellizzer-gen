    "intro": "Sprucina, commonly known as the silver spruce, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by wind, a common trait among coniferous species. Its cones are typically small and contain winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, Sprucina is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
