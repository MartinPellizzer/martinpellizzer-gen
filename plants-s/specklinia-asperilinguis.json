    "intro": "Specklinia asperilinguis, commonly known as the rough-leaved specklinia, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves that are covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Specklinia asperilinguis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ease of care in suitable conditions."
