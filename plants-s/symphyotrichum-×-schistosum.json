    "intro": "Symphyotrichum \u00d7 schistosum, commonly known as the New England aster hybrid, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Symphyotrichum novae-angliae (New England aster) and Symphyotrichum laeve (smooth coneflower). The plant is characterized by its showy, violet to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer to early fall. It typically grows in moist to wet soils in open areas such as meadows and wetlands. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking vibrant fall color."
