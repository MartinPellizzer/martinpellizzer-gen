    "intro": "Sophora tomentosa subsp. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal senna, is a shrub native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are covered in a dense, woolly pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which bloom in early spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in a pod and contain toxic compounds, making them unsuitable for human consumption. This subspecies is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments."
