    "intro": "Selaginella karimatae, commonly known as the Karimata's spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss found in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its creeping, branched stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporophylls that bear spores, which are released during the dry season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Selaginella karimatae is notable for its ability to survive in arid conditions due to its specialized water-storing tissues."
