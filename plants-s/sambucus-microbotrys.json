    "intro": "Sambucus microbotrys, commonly known as the European snowball tree, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that appear in early spring, giving it the common name. The plant produces red, berry-like drupes in late summer, which are edible but often have a bitter taste. Its leaves are palmately lobed and turn yellow in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. Sambucus microbotrys is often cultivated for its attractive flowers and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
