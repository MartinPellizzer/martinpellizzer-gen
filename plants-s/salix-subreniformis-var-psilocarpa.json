    "intro": "Salix subreniformis var. psilocarpa, commonly known as the hallucinogenic willow, is a rare variant of the willow tree native to parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, with sub-reniform (kidney-shaped) leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers, and its bark is typically grayish with a rough texture. While not a true hallucinogen, it has been associated with traditional use in certain regions for its potential psychoactive properties. Its botanical significance lies in its distinct genetic variation and ecological niche within its native habitat."
