It is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are often used as a natural sweetener. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, which are responsible for its intense sweetness. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and medicinal properties."
