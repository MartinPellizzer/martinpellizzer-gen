    "intro": "Soldanella hungarica var. minor, commonly known as the Hungarian snowbell, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Carpathian region. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a low-growing habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
