    "intro": "Spatholobus apoensis, commonly known as the Philippine wisteria, is a climbing legume native to the Philippines. It features pinnate leaves with 10 to 14 pairs of elliptical leaflets, and its flowers are clustered in dense, hanging inflorescences. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments. Its ornamental value comes from its fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in spring."
