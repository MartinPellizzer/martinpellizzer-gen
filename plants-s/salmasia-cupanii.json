    "intro": "Salmasia cupanii, commonly known as the Malagasy orchid, is a rare and unique species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, Salmasia cupanii is considered endangered."
