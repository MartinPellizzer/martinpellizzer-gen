    "intro": "Syzygium periyarense, commonly known as the Periyar apple, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical, glossy leaves. The tree produces small, white flowers that are followed by edible, round fruits with a sweet, acidic flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
