    "intro": "Swainsona monticola, commonly known as the mountain swainsona, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture, while its seeds are encased in a hard, spiny pod. Swainsona monticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
