It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, showy blue or purple flowers. The plant is adapted to salty, well-drained soils and can tolerate coastal winds and salt spray. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy or rocky shores, making it an important species in coastal ecosystems. Statice rarida is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms and delicate appearance."
