    "intro": "Sisymbrium dinteri, commonly known as the Dinter's broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, attaching itself via haustoria. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a fibrous, root-like structure that anchors it to the host. It is typically found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem as a parasite."
