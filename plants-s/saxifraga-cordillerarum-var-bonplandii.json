    "intro": "Saxifraga cordillerarum var. bonplandii, commonly known as the Bonpland's stonecrop, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Andes in South America. It is a perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
