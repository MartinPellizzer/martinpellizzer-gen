    "intro": "Sansevieria longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered snake plant, is a perennial evergreen plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped leaves that are typically green with distinct yellow or white margins. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, emerging from the base of the leaves. It is well adapted to low-light conditions and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Sansevieria longiflora is also valued for its air-purifying properties and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
