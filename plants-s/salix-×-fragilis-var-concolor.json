    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 fragilis var. concolor, commonly known as the white willow, is a hybrid willow species native to the northern regions of the United States and Canada. It is a deciduous tree or shrub characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically pale green on the underside. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are clustered in male and female inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and gray, often peeling in thin layers, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils near rivers and streams. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
