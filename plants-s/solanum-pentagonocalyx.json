    "intro": "Solanum pentagonocalyx, commonly known as the five-lobed nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its pentagonal calyx, which gives it its scientific name, and its small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale purple. Its fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that turns from green to yellow as it matures. Despite its ornamental appeal, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
