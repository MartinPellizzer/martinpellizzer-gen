    "intro": "Scirpus alpinus subsp. oliganthus, commonly known as the alpine club-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. The plant thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous tundra environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates. Its limited distribution and specialized habitat make it a subject of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
