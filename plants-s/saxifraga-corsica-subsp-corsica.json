    "intro": "Saxifraga corsica subsp. corsica, commonly known as the Corsican saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia. It typically thrives in rocky or limestone habitats, often found in alpine or subalpine areas. The plant features basal rosettes of dark green, spoon-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its small, white or pink flowers appear in clusters during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a hardy ground cover."
