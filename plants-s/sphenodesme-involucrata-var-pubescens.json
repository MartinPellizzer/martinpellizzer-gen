    "intro": "Sphenodesme involucrata var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent sphenodesme, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in terminal clusters, which bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a slightly waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. This variant is distinguished by its dense pubescence, which gives it a soft, fuzzy appearance."
