    "intro": "Sarracenia purpurea, commonly known as the purple pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to wetlands in North America. It is characterized by its distinctive tubular, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's bright red flowers are typically borne on tall, erect stems, adding to its ornamental appeal. Sarracenia purpurea thrives in boggy soils and requires consistent moisture and acidic conditions. Its unique adaptations for nutrient acquisition make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
