    "intro": "Scutellaria caudifolia var. obliquifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved skullcap, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers clustered in whorls along the stem, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its ornamental value and medicinal properties have made it a subject of interest in both horticulture and traditional herbal practices."
