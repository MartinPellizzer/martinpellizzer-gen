    "intro": "Solanum andigenum subsp. aya-papa, commonly known as the Aya-Papa tomato, is a wild tomato species native to the high Andes of Peru. It is a herbaceous perennial plant with hairy stems and alternate leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The flowers are yellow with five lobes and are borne in clusters, while the fruit is a small, orange-red berry that ripens in late summer. This subspecies is notable for its high genetic diversity and potential for use in breeding programs to improve cultivated tomato varieties. It thrives in cool, high-altitude environments and is adapted to poor, rocky soils."
