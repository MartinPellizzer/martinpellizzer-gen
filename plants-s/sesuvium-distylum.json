    "intro": "Sesuvium distylum, commonly known as rock saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It thrives in saline and arid environments, often found growing on rocky shores and sandy soils. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, appearing in clusters during the warmer months. Sesuvium distylum plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and is adapted to withstand high salinity and strong winds."
