It features hairy, grey-green foliage and produces small, violet flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant bears yellow-orange berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and sometimes invasive species in its native habitat."
