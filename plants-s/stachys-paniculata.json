    "intro": "Stachys paniculata, commonly known as hedge nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Stachys paniculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
