It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated leaves that turn yellow in the autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. This variant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal."
