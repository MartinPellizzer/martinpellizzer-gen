    "intro": "Styphelia oldfieldii, commonly known as the Oldfield's wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are leathery, dark green, and arranged in whorls around the stems. Styphelia oldfieldii is well adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland environments."
