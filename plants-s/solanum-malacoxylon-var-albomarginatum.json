It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves with white margins, giving it its distinctive appearance. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and it produces small, toxic berries that are not edible for humans or animals. Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is often cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
