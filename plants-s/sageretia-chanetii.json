    "intro": "Sageretia chanetii, commonly known as the Mexican sageretia, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in scrubland or woodland habitats. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds. Sageretia chanetii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
