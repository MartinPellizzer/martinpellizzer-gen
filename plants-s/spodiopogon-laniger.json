    "intro": "Spodiopogon laniger, commonly known as the woolly grass or hairy spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that bears small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, typical of many wetland plants. Spodiopogon laniger plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
