    "intro": "Sida pulcherrima, commonly known as the velvetleaf or red velvet plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch and its showy, red or pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields due to its adaptability. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like hibiscus and cotton. Sida pulcherrima is also notable for its role as a weed in some regions, where it can compete with crops for resources."
