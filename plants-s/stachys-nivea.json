    "intro": "Stachys nivea, commonly known as snowdrop mint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features slender, upright stems covered in soft, grayish-white hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence, contributing to its frosty look. Stachys nivea is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
