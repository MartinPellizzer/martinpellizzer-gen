It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white to pale pink flowers, which are typically tubular and arranged in spikes. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dunes. The white-flowered form is a distinct botanical variant, distinguished by its lighter floral coloration compared to the typical pink or red flowers of the species."
