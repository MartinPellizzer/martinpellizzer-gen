    "intro": "Selliguea subebenipes, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of liverwort that belongs to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant has a thalloid structure, meaning it lacks true leaves and stems, and instead has a flat, leaf-like structure called a thallus. Selliguea subebenipes is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophores, are borne on the upper surface of the thallus and are involved in sexual reproduction."
