    "intro": "Struthanthus dissimilis, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are usually white or pale purple, which bloom at night, attracting moths and other nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals."
