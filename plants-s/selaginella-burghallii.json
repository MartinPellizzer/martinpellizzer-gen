    "intro": "Selaginella burghallii, commonly known as the Burghall's spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to South America. It is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant features whorled leaves that are often spirally arranged along its stems. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are borne on the upper part of the plant and contain spores. Selaginella burghallii is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in ecological succession in forest understories."
