    "intro": "Sida sessiliflora, commonly known as desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, oval-shaped leaves and showy, pale purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations such as deep roots and reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss. Its fibrous stems and leaves have been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for fiber and medicinal purposes. Sida sessiliflora plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
