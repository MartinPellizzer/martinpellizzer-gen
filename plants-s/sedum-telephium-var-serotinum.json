    "intro": "Sedum telephium var. serotinum, commonly known as late-flowering stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to Europe. It features fleshy, upright stems and produces clusters of star-shaped, pinkish-red flowers in the late summer to autumn. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it store water, making it drought-tolerant. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in marginal garden conditions."
