    "intro": "Schefflera elliptica var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf umbrella plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features a dense, rounded crown with clusters of small, elliptical, glossy dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of low light conditions. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and bonsai."
