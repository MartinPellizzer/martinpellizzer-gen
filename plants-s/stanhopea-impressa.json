It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant produces showy, yellow and violet-colored blossoms with intricate patterns, making it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts. Stanhopea impressa is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures rather than in soil. It requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it a rewarding plant for experienced growers."
