It features rosettes of glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
