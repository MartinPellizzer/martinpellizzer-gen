    "intro": "Swartzia martii, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued in the musical instrument industry. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pink in color. Swartzia martii is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, with compound leaves and thorned branches. Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in many regions."
