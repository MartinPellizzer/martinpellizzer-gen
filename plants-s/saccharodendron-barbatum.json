It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in panicles. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Saccharodendron barbatum is often found in disturbed habitats and can become an invasive species in some regions."
