    "intro": "Staelia nelidae, commonly known as the slender staelia, is a rare and specialized plant species found in specific alpine environments. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are finely divided, contributing to its overall airy appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
