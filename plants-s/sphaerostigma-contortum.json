    "intro": "Sphaerostigma contortum, commonly known as the twisted spore orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, twisted growth pattern and small, delicate flowers that bloom in a spiral arrangement. The plant's botanical features include a short, rhizomatous stem and lanceolate leaves with a waxy surface. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a subtle fragrance, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, Sphaerostigma contortum is considered a vulnerable species."
