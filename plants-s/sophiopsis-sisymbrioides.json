    "intro": "Sophiopsis sisymbrioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf sophia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
