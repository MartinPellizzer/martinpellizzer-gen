    "intro": "Salicornia peruviana var. doeringii, commonly known as Peruvian glasswort, is a halophytic plant adapted to thrive in saline and coastal environments. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. This variety is native to South America, particularly Peru, and is often found in estuaries and salt marshes. The plant produces small, green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
