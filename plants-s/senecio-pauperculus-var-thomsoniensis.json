It features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces delicate, yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its low-growing habit and unique appearance make it a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts."
