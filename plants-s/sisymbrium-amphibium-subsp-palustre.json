    "intro": "Sisymbrium amphibium subsp. palustre, commonly known as the marsh tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found along the edges of ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branched stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its small, yellow flowers are arranged in racemes. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive, slightly hairy texture. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions, making it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems."
