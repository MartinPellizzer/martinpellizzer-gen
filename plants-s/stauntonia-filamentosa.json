    "intro": "Stauntonia filamentosa, commonly known as the laceleaf sterculia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely divided and often covered in a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous small, hairy seeds. Stauntonia filamentosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated as a shade plant in tropical gardens."
