    "intro": "Selaginella, commonly known as spike moss, is a genus of vascular plants belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. These plants are often found in moist, shaded environments and are characterized by their small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stems. Selaginella species are notable for their ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation, due to their specialized water-storing cells. They reproduce via spores, and many species exhibit heterospory, producing both megaspores and microspores. Selaginella plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
