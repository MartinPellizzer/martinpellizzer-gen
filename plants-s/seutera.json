    "intro": "Seutera, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to Africa. These plants are characterized by their compact growth habit and showy, velvety flowers that come in a variety of colors. The leaves are typically dark green and velvety to the touch, often with a waxy coating. Seutera species are popular houseplants due to their ability to thrive in low-light conditions and their ability to bloom throughout the year. They are also valued for their ornamental appeal and ease of care."
