    "intro": "Stipa pennata subsp. iberica, commonly known as the Iberian feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and produces feathery, panicle-like inflorescences that are often pinkish or purplish in color. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and along riverbanks. It has narrow, linear leaves and is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in arid environments."
