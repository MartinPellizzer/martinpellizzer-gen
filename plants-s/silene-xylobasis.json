    "intro": "Silene xylobasis, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and clustered, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Silene xylobasis has small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
