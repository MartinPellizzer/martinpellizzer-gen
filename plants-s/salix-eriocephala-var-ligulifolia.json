    "intro": "Salix eriocephala var. ligulifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and wet meadows. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities, making it a popular choice in landscaping."
