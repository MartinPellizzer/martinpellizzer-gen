    "intro": "Stachys pilifera, commonly known as woolly betony, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, square stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces spikes of purple or pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Stachys pilifera thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value and ability to naturalize make it a popular choice in horticulture."
