    "intro": "Selaginella cinerascens, commonly known as the ashen spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance. It is a terrestrial, non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that form dense, cushion-like structures, often with a bluish or grayish hue. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophylls. Selaginella cinerascens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
