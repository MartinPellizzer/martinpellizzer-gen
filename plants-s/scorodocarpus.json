    "intro": "Scorodocarpus, commonly known as the \"screw pine,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Pandanaceae. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Scorodocarpus species have small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually followed by fruiting bodies known as scorodochasms. These plants are adapted to coastal and saline environments, making them resilient to salt spray and wind."
