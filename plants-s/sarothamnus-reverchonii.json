    "intro": "Sarothamnus reverchonii, commonly known as Reverchon's thornbush, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in the spring, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Its hardy nature makes it a resilient plant in coastal and semi-arid regions."
