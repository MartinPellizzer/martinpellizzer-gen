    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 semireticulata, commonly known as the Weeping Willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the northern regions of China. It is characterized by its weeping habit, with long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect. The tree produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a serrated margin. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age."
