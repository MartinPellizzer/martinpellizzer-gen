It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are tubular in shape and attract various pollinators.

Its medicinal properties have been studied for potential use in traditional herbal remedies."
