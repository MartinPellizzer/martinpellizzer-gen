    "intro": "Solidago monticola, commonly known as the mountain goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small yellow clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Solidago monticola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
