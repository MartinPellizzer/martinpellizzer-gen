    "intro": "Sedum rubens subsp. cespitosum, commonly known as the red stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features dense clusters of fleshy, blue-green leaves that form a mat-like growth habit. The plant produces vibrant red flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions with minimal care."
