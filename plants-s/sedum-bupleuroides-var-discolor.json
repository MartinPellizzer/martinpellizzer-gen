    "intro": "Sedum bupleuroides var. discolor, commonly known as the Variegated Stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to the southeastern United States. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves with white or yellow markings, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer months. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This hardy perennial is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
