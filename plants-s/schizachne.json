    "intro": "Schizachne, commonly known as the panic grasses, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and are characterized by their tall, often tufted growth habit. Schizachne species typically have narrow, linear leaves and produce small, spike-like inflorescences. They are often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, where they play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms. Some species are cultivated for their ornamental value or used in traditional medicine."
