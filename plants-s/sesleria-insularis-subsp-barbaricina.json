It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a notable species within the Sesleria genus."
