It typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly bitter taste, often used in traditional medicine. Sisymbrium lineare is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
