    "intro": "Sarcopygme mayorii, commonly known as the giant sarcopygme, is a striking member of the Araliaceae family native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. This plant is characterized by its large, waxy leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, often featuring a deep green color with a glossy texture. Its unique inflorescence consists of clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting various pollinators. The plant's roots are known to produce a milky sap, which has been traditionally used in local medicine. Due to habitat destruction, Sarcopygme mayorii is now considered a rare and endangered species."
