    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 japopina, commonly known as the Japanese weeping willow, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the Japanese willow (Salix koreensis) and the European weeping willow (Salix babylonica). It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in gardens and parks."
