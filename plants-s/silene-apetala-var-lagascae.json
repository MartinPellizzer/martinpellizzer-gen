    "intro": "Silene apetala var. lagascae, commonly known as the Lagasca sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has adapted to harsh, dry environments through its succulent leaves and deep root system, which help it retain water. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Silene apetala var. lagascae is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun and minimal moisture conditions."
