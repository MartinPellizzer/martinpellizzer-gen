    "intro": "Shortia transalpina, commonly known as the alpine shortia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant has basal leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a hairy surface. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Shortia transalpina is considered a rare and endangered species."
