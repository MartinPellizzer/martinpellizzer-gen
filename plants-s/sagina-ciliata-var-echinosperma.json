    "intro": "Sagina ciliata var. echinosperma, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features small, succulent leaves covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions. The variety echinosperma is distinguished by its spiny, spherical seed capsules, which aid in seed dispersal."
