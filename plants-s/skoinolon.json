    "intro": "Skoinolon, commonly known as the silverleaf plant, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of Africa. It features silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence that reflects sunlight, reducing water loss. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought. Skoinolon is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
