    "intro": "Stipa blackii, commonly known as Black's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, spikelike inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Stipa blackii thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in grasslands and steppe environments. Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it an important component of native plant communities."
