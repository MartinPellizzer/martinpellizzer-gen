    "intro": "Stemonurus gitingensis, commonly known as the Gitingensis Stemonurus, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae, which includes various ferns and their allies. The plant is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, clustered leaves that often form dense mats on the forest floor. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are typically found on the underside of the leaves, a feature common among many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Stemonurus gitingensis is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
