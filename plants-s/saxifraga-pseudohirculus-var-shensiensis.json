    "intro": "Saxifraga pseudohirculus var. shensiensis, commonly known as the Sichuan saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
