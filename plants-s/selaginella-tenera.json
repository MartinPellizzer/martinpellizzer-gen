    "intro": "Selaginella tenera, commonly known as the tropical spikemoss, is a species of clubmoss found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Selaginella tenera is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in controlled environments."
