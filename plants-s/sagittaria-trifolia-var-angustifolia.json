It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and elongated, adapted for water environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spikes, often above the water surface. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, helping it colonize and stabilize wetland soils. It plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
