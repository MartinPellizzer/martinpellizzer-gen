It belongs to the Pedaliaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, off-white seeds. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and roadsides. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
