    "intro": "Sinarundinaria fimbriata, commonly known as the Chinese cliff brake, is a fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, horizontal underground stems that help it spread. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a distinctive frayed or toothed edge. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky cliffs or in forest understories."
