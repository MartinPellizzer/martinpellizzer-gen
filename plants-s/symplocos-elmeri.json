    "intro": "Symplocos elmeri, commonly known as Elmer's wax myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or wetland areas. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green on top, with a lighter underside. Its flowers are white and clustered in small umbels, and it produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Symplocos elmeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging wetland environments."
