    "intro": "Scleria multifoliata var. pilosula, commonly known as the hairy-leaved sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming during the wet season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects."
