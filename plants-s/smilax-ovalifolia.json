    "intro": "Smilax ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. Smilax ovalifolia is known for its ability to climb using tendrils and its role in supporting local wildlife."
