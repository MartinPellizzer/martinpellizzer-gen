    "intro": "Scleranthus perennis var. atlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic sandparsley, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of the northeastern United States. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and maritime habitats. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in coastal environments. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
