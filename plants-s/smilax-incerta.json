    "intro": "Smilax incerta, commonly known as the uncertain smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny growth, which help it climb and defend itself. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. Its berries are dark red to black and are an important food source for various birds and mammals. Smilax incerta is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade."
