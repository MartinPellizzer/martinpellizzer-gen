    "intro": "Sparattanthelium cordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf sparrowgrass, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silver-gray hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep violet, typically blooming during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky crevices or shaded forest understories. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Sparattanthelium cordatum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
