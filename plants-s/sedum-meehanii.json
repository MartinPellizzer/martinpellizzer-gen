    "intro": "Sedum meehanii, commonly known as the Meehan's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum meehanii is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
