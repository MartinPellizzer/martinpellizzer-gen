    "intro": "Schizachyrium fragile var. malayanum, commonly known as the Malayan switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as swampy areas and along riverbanks. Its fibrous root system makes it an important species for erosion control and ecological restoration projects."
