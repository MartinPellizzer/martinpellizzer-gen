    "intro": "Solanum ochroneurum var. micracanthum, commonly known as the slender nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces berries that are typically red when ripe, containing seeds within a fleshy pulp. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided for consumption but is studied for its potential botanical and ecological significance."
