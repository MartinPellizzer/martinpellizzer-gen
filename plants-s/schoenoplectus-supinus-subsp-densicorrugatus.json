    "intro": "Schoenoplectus supinus subsp. densicorrugatus, commonly known as the dense-ribbed bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often reach heights of up to 2 meters. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive dense, corrugated texture along the midrib. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, three-lobed flowers. This subspecies is adapted to moist or aquatic habitats and plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils."
