    "intro": "Salicornia fruticulosa, commonly known as sea beans, is a salt-tolerant flowering plant belonging to the Amaranthaceae family. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a layer of fine, salt-excreting hairs. This plant thrives in coastal environments, particularly in brackish or saline soils, and is often found in estuaries and tidal flats. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically green or red and appear in clusters. Salicornia fruticulosa is an important species for stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
