    "intro": "Sempervivum cuspidatum, commonly known as the pointed houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the Alps and surrounding regions. It features rosettes of fleshy, pointed leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall flowering stalks in late summer, bearing clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in cold climates, often persisting through harsh winters."
