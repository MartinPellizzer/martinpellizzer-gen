    "intro": "Scirpus marginulatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often emerging from dense clusters of rhizomes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense, spike-like inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive pale green to silver-white margin. Scirpus marginulatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
