    "intro": "Sedum purpureum, commonly known as the purple stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. Sedum purpureum is also valued for its ability to bloom throughout the summer, adding ornamental value to garden spaces."
