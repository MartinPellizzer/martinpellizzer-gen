    "intro": "Schoenus tenellus, commonly known as the slender flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly compressed, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like in appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Schoenus tenellus plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
