    "intro": "Salix lapponum var. trautvetteriana, commonly known as the Trautvetter's willow, is a shrub native to Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, oval leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it blooms in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in cold climates for ornamental purposes."
