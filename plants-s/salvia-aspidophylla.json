    "intro": "Salvia aspidophylla, commonly known as the ice plant or frost plant, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of Namibia and Angola. It is characterized by its dense, fleshy foliage that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments. The plant produces striking violet or blue flowers during the rainy season, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in well-drained soils make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Salvia aspidophylla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
