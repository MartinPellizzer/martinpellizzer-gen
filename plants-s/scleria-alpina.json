    "intro": "Scleria alpina, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows. Its slender, triangular stems are usually unbranched, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers.
