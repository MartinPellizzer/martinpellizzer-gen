    "intro": "Salix turuchanensis, commonly known as the Turuchan willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia. It is adapted to harsh, cold environments and typically grows in tundra and taiga ecosystems. The plant has slender, often multi-branched stems and produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold climates. Salix turuchanensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for arctic flora and fauna."
