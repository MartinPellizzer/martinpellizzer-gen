It is characterized by its rounded, glossy leaves and clusters of yellowish-white flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible for wildlife but generally considered bitter by humans. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and open woodlands. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local fauna."
