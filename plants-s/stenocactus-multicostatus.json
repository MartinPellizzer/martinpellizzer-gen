    "intro": "Stenocactus multicostatus, commonly known as the clustered rock cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that often grow in clusters, forming a compact, spiny structure. The plant has a unique ribbed appearance with prominent, sharp spines that provide protection from herbivores. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, blooming in late spring or early summer. Stenocactus multicostatus is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
