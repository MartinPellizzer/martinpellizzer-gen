    "intro": "Spiraea microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, dark green leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length, giving it a compact and dense appearance. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Spiraea microphylla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
