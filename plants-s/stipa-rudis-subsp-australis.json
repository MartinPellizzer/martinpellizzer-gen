It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as sandy soils and rocky areas. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with fine, needle-like leaves. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. This subspecies is well adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in native landscapes."
