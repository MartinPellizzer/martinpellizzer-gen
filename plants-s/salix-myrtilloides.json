    "intro": "Salix myrtilloides, commonly known as the black willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy beneath. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, dark berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in riparian areas. Salix myrtilloides is also valued for its role in erosion control and habitat creation."
