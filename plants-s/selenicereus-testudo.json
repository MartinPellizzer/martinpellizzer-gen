    "intro": "Selenicereus testudo, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are typically spiny, providing protection from herbivores, while its roots are adapted to absorb moisture efficiently. The plant's unique nocturnal blooming habit and striking floral display make it a popular ornamental species."
