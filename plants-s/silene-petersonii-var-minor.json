    "intro": "Silene petersonii var. minor, commonly known as the Peterson's catchfly, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowering period occurs during the spring and early summer, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
