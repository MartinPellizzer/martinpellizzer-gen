    "intro": "Struthanthus schultesii, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as desert plains and sandy soils. The plant features showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Struthanthus schultesii is characterized by its globular shape, with multiple branches forming a compact, rounded plant."
