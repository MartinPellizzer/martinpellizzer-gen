    "intro": "Spiraea chamaedryfolia var. transiens, commonly known as the creeping spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, arching stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form dense ground cover. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are elliptical, opposite, and have a slightly serrated edge, turning yellow in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and border plantings."
