    "intro": "Salix cinerea var. aquatica, commonly known as water willow, is a variant of the gray willow native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silky down. The plant thrives in moist or aquatic conditions, often found along the edges of ponds, streams, and marshes. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils. This variant is valued for its ecological importance in supporting aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
