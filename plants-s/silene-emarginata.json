It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a fringe-like appearance, contributing to its common name. Silene emarginata is generally short-lived and has a limited geographic distribution."
