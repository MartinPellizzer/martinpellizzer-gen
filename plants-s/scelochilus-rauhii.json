    "intro": "Scelochilus rauhii, commonly known as the Rauh's scelochilus, is a rare and striking member of the Gesneriaceae family, native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and plant enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and limited propagation, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
