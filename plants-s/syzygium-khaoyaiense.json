It is native to Thailand and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy green upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, sour fruits similar to tamarind. Syzygium khaoyaiense thrives in tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ecological and potential agricultural studies."
