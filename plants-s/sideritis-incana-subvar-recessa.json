    "intro": "Sideritis incana subvar. recessa, commonly known as the alpine bluehead, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, with a soft, fuzzy texture. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual interest."
