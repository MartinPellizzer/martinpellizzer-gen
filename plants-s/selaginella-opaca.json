    "intro": "Selaginella opaca, commonly known as the hardy spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its dense, low-growing structure. It features small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stems, which are typically green to reddish in color. This plant is known for its ability to survive in arid conditions due to its efficient water retention mechanisms. Selaginella opaca is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in environments with limited moisture. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
