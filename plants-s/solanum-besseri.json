    "intro": "Solanum besseri, commonly known as Bessera nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a rough texture, and the fruit is a small, round berry that turns red when mature. Solanum besseri is often found in high-altitude regions and is adapted to cool, moist environments."
