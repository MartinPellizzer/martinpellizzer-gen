It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, ovate leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in loose, branching clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional herbal remedies. Silphium ovatifolium is valued for its medicinal properties and is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
