    "intro": "Sympieza vestita, commonly known as the naked sympieza, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant features slender, hairy stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels. Its leaves are typically finely divided and covered in a thin, waxy layer that helps reduce water loss. Sympieza vestita is often found in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
