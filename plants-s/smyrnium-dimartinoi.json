    "intro": "Smyrnium dimartinoi, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cowbane, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and finely divided, pinnate leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Smyrnium dimartinoi is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in meadows. It is considered a minor weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
