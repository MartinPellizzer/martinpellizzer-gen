    "intro": "Saussurea umbrosa f. herbicola, commonly known as the alpine thistle or alpine saussurea, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and other mountainous areas. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, woolly leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual element to its alpine habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand harsh weather conditions. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is often studied for its role in alpine ecosystems."
