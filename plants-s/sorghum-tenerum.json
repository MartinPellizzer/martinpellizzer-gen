    "intro": "Sorghum tenerum, commonly known as dwarf sorghum, is a small grain plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soil. Due to its hardiness, it is often used as a forage crop or for traditional food purposes in various parts of Africa and Asia."
