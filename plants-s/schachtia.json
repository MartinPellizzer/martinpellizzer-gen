    "intro": "Schachtia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Schachtia species are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers. The wood of some species is valued for its fine grain and reddish color, though it is often confused with true sandalwood. Due to overharvesting, many Schachtia species are now threatened or endangered."
