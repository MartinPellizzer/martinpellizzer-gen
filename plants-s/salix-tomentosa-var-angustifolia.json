    "intro": "Salix tomentosa var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine, woolly coating. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, wetlands, or along riverbanks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
