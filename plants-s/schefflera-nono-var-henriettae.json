    "intro": "Schefflera nono var. henriettae, commonly known as Henrietta's Nono, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features a dense, rounded growth habit with glossy, dark green leaves that are slightly lobed and emit a subtle fragrance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by black berries, though it is primarily cultivated for its ornamental foliage rather than its blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate watering, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its slow growth rate and adaptability to various soil types contribute to its popularity among plant enthusiasts."
