It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of pinkish-red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
