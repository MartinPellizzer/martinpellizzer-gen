    "intro": "Stapelia gigantea, commonly known as the giant star plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces large, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive scent resembling decaying flesh. These flowers bloom in late summer and are followed by small, round fruits. Stapelia gigantea is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
