    "intro": "Stenandrium pallidum, commonly known as the pale stenandrium, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Stenandrium pallidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
