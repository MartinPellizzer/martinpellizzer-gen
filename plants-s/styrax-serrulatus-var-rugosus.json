    "intro": "Styrax serrulatus var. rugosus, commonly known as the rough-stemmed fringewood, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rough, woody stems and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with serrated edges that give the plant its scientific name. This species is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
