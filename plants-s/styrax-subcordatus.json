    "intro": "Styrax subcordatus, commonly known as the Indian snowbell, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by pendulous, woody capsules containing small, dark brown seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. The bark and flowers have been used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties."
