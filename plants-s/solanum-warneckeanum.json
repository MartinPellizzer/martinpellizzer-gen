    "intro": "Solanum warneckeanum, commonly known as the Warneckeanum nightshade, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers and hairy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, round berries that turn from green to yellow as they mature. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. Due to its toxic compounds, it is not typically cultivated for food but is studied for its potential medicinal properties."
