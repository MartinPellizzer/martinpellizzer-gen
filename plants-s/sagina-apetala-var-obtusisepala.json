    "intro": "Sagina apetala var. obtusisepala, commonly known as the broad-sepal sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant characterized by its tiny, oval-shaped leaves. It produces small, white flowers with four sepals that are rounded and broader than those of the typical species. The plant thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal areas or along the edges of wetlands. Its flowers are usually clustered in dense inflorescences, and the plant is known for its ability to tolerate salt spray and harsh coastal conditions. It is a common species in the Mediterranean region and parts of western Europe."
