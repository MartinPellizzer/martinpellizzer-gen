    "intro": "Selaginella inaequalifolia, commonly known as the variable spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping stem with whorled leaves that are often dimorphic, meaning they vary in shape and size along the stem. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and produce spores, which are essential for its propagation. Selaginella inaequalifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
