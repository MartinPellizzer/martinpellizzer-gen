    "intro": "Silene secundiflora, commonly known as the trailing campion, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of pink or red flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, trailing stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and slopes. Silene secundiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
