    "intro": "Salix doiana, commonly known as the Kashmir willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with a distinctive flaky texture. Salix doiana is adapted to cold, mountainous climates and is often found in moist, rocky soils at elevations above 2,500 meters."
