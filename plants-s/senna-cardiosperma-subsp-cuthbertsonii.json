    "intro": "Senna cardiosperma subsp. cuthbertsonii, commonly known as the narrowleaf senna, is a shrub native to arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with narrow, linear lobes and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces cylindrical pods containing several seeds, and it is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils. It has a deep root system that enables it to access water from deeper soil layers. This species is often used in revegetation projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas."
