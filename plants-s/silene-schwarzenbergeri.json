    "intro": "Silene schwarzenbergeri, commonly known as the Schwerzenberger's campion, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces striking pink or white flowers with five petals, and it has a compact, low-growing habit. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Silene schwarzenbergeri is adapted to cold climates and is often found in areas with strong sunlight and limited soil."
