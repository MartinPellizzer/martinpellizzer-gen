It is native to Africa and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and striking red or purple foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient crop in regions with limited water availability. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and potentially useful for agricultural purposes."
