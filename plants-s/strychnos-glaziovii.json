    "intro": "Strychnos glaziovii, commonly known as the Glaziov's nux vomica, is a shrub or small tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the toxic seeds, which are the source of strychnine and brucine. Due to its toxic properties, it is often found in shaded, humid environments and is used in traditional medicine despite its dangers."
