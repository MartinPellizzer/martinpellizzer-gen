    "intro": "Syzygium casiguranense, commonly known as the Casiguran apple or Philippine apple, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to the Philippines, specifically the island of Mindanao, where it grows in lowland to montane forests. The plant is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and oval-shaped leaves that are usually glossy on the upper surface. Its flowers are small, white, and fragrant, typically blooming in clusters, while the fruit is a small, round, red or yellowish drupe with a sweet, aromatic flavor. Syzygium casiguranense is valued not only for its ornamental qualities but also for its potential in agroforestry and local cuisine."
