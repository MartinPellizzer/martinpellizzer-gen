    "intro": "Spigelia, commonly known as the Indian pipe, is a unique flowering plant characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, giving it a ghostly, pale appearance. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is native to eastern North America. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Spigelia is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some nutrients from its host plants while still performing photosynthesis to a limited extent. Its striking appearance and ecological role make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
