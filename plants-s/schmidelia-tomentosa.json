    "intro": "Schmidelia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly schmidelia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green foliage and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has a creeping growth habit with rhizomatous stems. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in dense, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. Schmidelia tomentosa is often found in shaded, humid environments and is relatively uncommon in the wild."
