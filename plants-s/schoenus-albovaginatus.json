    "intro": "Schoenus albovaginatus, commonly known as the white sheath sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that have a distinctive white sheath at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
