    "intro": "Strychnos quaqua, commonly known as the African poisonwood, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Africa. It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its bark and leaves contain toxic alkaloids, which make it potentially dangerous to handle. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though with great caution."
