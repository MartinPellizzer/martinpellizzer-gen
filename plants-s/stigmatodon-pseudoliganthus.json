    "intro": "Stigmatodon pseudoliganthus, commonly known as the false liganthus, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to habitat loss, Stigmatodon pseudoliganthus is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists studying plant conservation."
