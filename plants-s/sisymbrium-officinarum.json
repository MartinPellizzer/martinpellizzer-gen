    "intro": "Sisymbrium officinarum, commonly known as wild mustard, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm, featuring slender stems and alternate leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its fruits are short, cylindrical pods that split open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Sisymbrium officinarum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in fields, and it has been used historically in traditional medicine."
