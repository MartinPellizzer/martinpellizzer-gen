    "intro": "Salix rigida var. angustata, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil make it an important species in riparian habitats."
