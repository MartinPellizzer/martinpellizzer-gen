    "intro": "Saxifraga granulata subsp. hochstetteri, commonly known as the Hochstetter's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, granular texture, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is well adapted to cold climates. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging garden conditions."
