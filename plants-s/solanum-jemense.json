    "intro": "Solanum jemense, commonly known as the Jemense nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is native to parts of Africa, particularly Ethiopia, where it thrives in dry, arid environments. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are ovate and have a slightly hairy texture, while its fruits are typically berries that turn red when mature. Solanum jemense is often found in rocky soils and can tolerate high temperatures and limited water availability."
