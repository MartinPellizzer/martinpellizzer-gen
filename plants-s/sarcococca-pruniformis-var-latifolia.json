    "intro": "Sarcococca pruniformis var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf sarcococca, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to China. It features dark green, glossy leaves that are broad and elliptical in shape, providing dense foliage throughout the year. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red berries that persist into winter. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it an excellent choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive foliage and seasonal interest, suitable for ground cover in shaded areas."
