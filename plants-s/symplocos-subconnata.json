It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes other shrubs and small trees. The plant is characterized by its small, white, bell-shaped flowers that appear in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a leathery texture, while its stems are woody and often have a reddish hue. Symplocos subconnata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
