    "intro": "Sium latifolium var. longifolium, commonly known as broadleaf watercress, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It features broad, floating leaves that can reach up to 10 centimeters in length, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from June to August. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in wetland environments. It is often found in shallow water, marshes, and along the edges of streams and ponds."
