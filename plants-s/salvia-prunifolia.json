    "intro": "Salvia prunifolia, commonly known as the cherry-leaved sage, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, reddish-brown leaves that resemble small cherries, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is widely cultivated in arid and semi-arid climates."
