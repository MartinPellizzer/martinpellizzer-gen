    "intro": "Stelis posadarum, commonly known as the orchid of the genus Stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant typically produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and green. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and indirect sunlight. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, making it well-suited for its natural habitat in forest canopies."
