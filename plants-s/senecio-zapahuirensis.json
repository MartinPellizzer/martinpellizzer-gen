It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its foliage is usually gray-green, with narrow, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss.
