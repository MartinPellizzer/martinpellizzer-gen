    "intro": "Selaginella stolleana, commonly known as the Christmas moss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a unique ability to survive extreme drought conditions due to its specialized water-storing cells. Its foliage consists of small, scale-like leaves that form dense mats, and it produces spores in cone-like structures. Selaginella stolleana is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and air-purifying properties."
