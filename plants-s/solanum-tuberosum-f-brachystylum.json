It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter stems compared to the typical potato plant. This form exhibits unique morphological traits, including reduced internode length and a more bushy appearance. It is primarily cultivated for its tubers, which are similar in nutritional value to standard potatoes. The plant belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is adapted to temperate climates."
