    "intro": "Salix occidentalis var. longipes, commonly known as the longstem willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and long, slender branches that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside, and they turn yellow in the fall. It produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination and seed dispersal. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in riparian zones and moist woodland areas."
