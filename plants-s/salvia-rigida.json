    "intro": "Salvia rigida, commonly known as rigid sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces striking spikes of purple or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. Salvia rigida is often used in xeriscaping due to its ability to thrive in poor soil and with minimal water."
