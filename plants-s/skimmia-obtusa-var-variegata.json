    "intro": "Skimmia obtusa var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated skimmia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features glossy, dark green leaves with striking white or yellow variegation, adding visual interest to gardens. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in late winter or early spring, followed by red berries that persist into winter. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens or as a container plant. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is often used in rock gardens or as a specimen plant."
