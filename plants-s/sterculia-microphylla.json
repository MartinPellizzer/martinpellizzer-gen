    "intro": "Sterculia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved sterculia, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, spiny capsules containing numerous seeds. Its bark is thick and rugged, often exuding a milky sap when wounded. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
