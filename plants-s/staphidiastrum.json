    "intro": "Staphidiastrum, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rutaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which often has a silvery or grayish underside due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The leaves are typically alternate, simple, and ovate to elliptic in shape. Staphidiastrum species produce small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific."
