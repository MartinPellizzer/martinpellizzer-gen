    "intro": "Senecio foetidus, commonly known as stinking groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a strong, unpleasant odor, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores. The flowers are yellow and bloom in the summer, attracting various pollinators."
