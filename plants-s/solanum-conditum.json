    "intro": "Solanum conditum, commonly known as the black nightshade, is a flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant produces small, egg-shaped berries that turn from green to black as they mature. These berries are toxic to humans and animals, containing alkaloids such as solanin and scopolamine. Despite its toxicity, it has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
