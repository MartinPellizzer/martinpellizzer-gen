    "intro": "Salacistis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, slender stem and striking, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows on the trunks of trees, relying on its mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. It lacks leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, making it highly specialized. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Salacistis is listed as endangered, highlighting its ecological significance."
