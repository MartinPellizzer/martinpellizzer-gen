    "intro": "Senecio wernerioides var. exscapus, commonly known as the Wernerioides dwarf groundsel, is a low-growing, mat-forming succulent native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often used in dry, arid landscapes."
