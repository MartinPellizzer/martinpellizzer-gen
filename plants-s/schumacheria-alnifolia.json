    "intro": "Schumacheria alnifolia, commonly known as the alderleaf yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that can reach heights of up to 10 feet. The plant produces striking white to pale blue flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are long, narrow, and lance-shaped, often resembling those of alder trees, hence its common name. Schumacheria alnifolia is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species."
