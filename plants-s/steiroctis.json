    "intro": "Steiroctis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique ability to absorb nutrients through its roots directly from the air. The plant typically grows on tree branches, forming a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi. Its flowers are small, white, and delicate, often blooming in clusters. Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, Steiroctis is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its natural environment."
