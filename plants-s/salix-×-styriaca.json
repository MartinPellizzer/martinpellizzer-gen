    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 styriaca, commonly known as the Weeping Willow, is a hybrid willow species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, cascading branches that droop gracefully, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, and its leaves are typically broad and serrated. It thrives in moist environments, such as riverbanks and wetlands, and is often used in ornamental landscaping. The bark is smooth and gray, with a fibrous texture that becomes more prominent as the tree matures."
