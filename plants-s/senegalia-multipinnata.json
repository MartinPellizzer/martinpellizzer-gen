    "intro": "Senegalia multipinnata, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and feathery, bipinnate leaves that give it a delicate, silky appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, flat pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a waxy coating on its leaves to reduce water loss. Senegalia multipinnata is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of browse for livestock."
