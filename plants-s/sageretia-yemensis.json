It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic, small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has small, elliptical leaves with a rough texture and emits a subtle, spicy fragrance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid climate of its native region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
