    "intro": "Sedum affine, commonly known as the common stonecrop, is a perennial succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is characterized by its ability to store water in its thick leaves, allowing it to thrive in arid or rocky environments. Sedum affine typically grows in full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight."
