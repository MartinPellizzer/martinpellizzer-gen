    "intro": "Sida corrugata var. nematopoda, commonly known as the rough sida, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides or in wetlands. The plant features small, pale green leaves with a rough texture, and its flowers are inconspicuous, often clustered in loose inflorescences. It produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to spread in suitable habitats. The plant is often considered a weed but has ecological value in supporting insect populations."
