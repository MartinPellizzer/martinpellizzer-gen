    "intro": "Sagina muscosa, commonly known as common sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in moist, sandy or rocky soils. It is characterized by its tiny, closely packed leaves and small white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is often found in coastal areas, wet meadows, and disturbed sites, showcasing its adaptability to various environments. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that release seeds. Sagina muscosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
