    "intro": "Solidago villosa, commonly known as the hairy goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small cones. The plant typically grows in moist to dry soils in open woods, meadows, and along stream banks. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance, and it is often used in native plant gardens for its ecological benefits."
