    "intro": "Solanum parasiticum, commonly known as the parasitic nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially penetrates the roots of host plants to obtain water and nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers and has elliptical, often hairy leaves. Its fruit is a globose berry that turns red when mature, containing several seeds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth of its host plants."
