    "intro": "Stanhopea platyceras, commonly known as the broad-capped stanhopea, is a tropical orchid native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated pseudobulbs and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, often in cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it attaches itself to trees without being parasitic. The species is valued by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively compact growth habit."
