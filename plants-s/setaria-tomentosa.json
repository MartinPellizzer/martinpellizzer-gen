    "intro": "Setaria tomentosa, commonly known as hairy dropseed, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with hairy leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. Setaria tomentosa is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
