    "intro": "Selliguea subsparsa, commonly known as the sparse frond liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, sprawling growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has simple, lobed leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, translucent cells, which help in water retention. It reproduces through spores released from leaf-like structures called gametophores. Selliguea subsparsa is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality and habitat conditions due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
