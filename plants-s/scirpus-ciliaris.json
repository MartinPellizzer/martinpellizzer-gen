    "intro": "Scirpus ciliaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a wetland plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a tall, perennial herb that grows in shallow water or damp soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has elongated, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are narrow, grass-like, with hairy margins. Its flowering spikes are usually unisexual, with male flowers at the base and female flowers above, a feature common in the Cyperaceae family. Scirpus ciliaris plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
