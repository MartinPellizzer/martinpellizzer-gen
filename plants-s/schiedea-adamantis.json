    "intro": "Schiedea adamantis, commonly known as the Adamant's snowplant, is a rare and endemic species native to Hawaii. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and delicate, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in high-elevation, moist environments, typically found on windward slopes of Haleakal\u0101 and Mauna Loa. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Schiedea adamantis is considered endangered."
