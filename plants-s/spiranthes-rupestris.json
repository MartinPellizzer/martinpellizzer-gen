    "intro": "Spiranthes rupestris, commonly known as the rock twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, spiral-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy habitats, often in open woodlands or along streambanks. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pale yellow, bloom in late summer and are pollinated by various insects. Spiranthes rupestris is a low-growing plant that thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in association with other early-successional plant species."
