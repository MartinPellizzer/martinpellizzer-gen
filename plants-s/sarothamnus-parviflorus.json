    "intro": "Sarothamnus parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered thornbush, is a flowering shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Sarothamnus parviflorus is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
