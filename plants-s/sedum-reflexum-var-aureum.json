    "intro": "Sedum reflexum var. aureum, commonly known as the golden stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that turn golden at the edges, especially in full sun. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact form and vibrant color make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
