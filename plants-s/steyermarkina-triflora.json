    "intro": "Steyermarkina triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered steyermarkia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae, which includes bellflowers, and is characterized by its delicate, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its botanical features include trifoliate leaves and showy, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
