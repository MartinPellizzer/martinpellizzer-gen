    "intro": "Sempervivum venustum, commonly known as the silver rose or snowflake plant, is a species of succulent belonging to the Crassulaceae family. It is native to the Pyrenees and other mountainous regions of Europe, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features rosettes of fleshy, silver-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. Sempervivum venustum is a hardy, low-maintenance plant that is well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings."
