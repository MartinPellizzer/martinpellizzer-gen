    "intro": "Setaria albovillosa, commonly known as white-haired dropseed, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear delicate, pale green to golden flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a suitable choice for native plant gardens. Setaria albovillosa is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in natural habitats."
