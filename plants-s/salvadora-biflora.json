    "intro": "Salvadora biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered salvadora, is a shrub native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in pairs, giving it its scientific name. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces a fruit that splits open to release its seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Salvadora biflora is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
