    "intro": "Scleroglossum intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate hard-shelled lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae and is notable for its crustose growth form, which adheres tightly to rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale to dark brown, with a firm, leathery texture that provides structural support. It contains a complex mixture of fungal and algal components, which contribute to its ecological role in nutrient cycling. This lichen is often found in moist, shaded environments, where it thrives on limestone or other calcareous substrates."
