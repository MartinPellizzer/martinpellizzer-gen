    "intro": "Sorbus densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Sorbus densiflora is often found in rocky or well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
