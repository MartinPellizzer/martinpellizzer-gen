It features showy, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by orange to red berries in the fall. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and is often found in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and forest edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. The berries are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife species."
