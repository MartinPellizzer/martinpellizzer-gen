    "intro": "Saccus rigidus, commonly known as the rigid sac plant, is a unique species characterized by its distinctive sac-like structures. It is a perennial herb native to specific regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. The plant features rigid, elongated stems that support its specialized sacs, which are modified leaves used for water storage. These sacs are thick-walled and help the plant survive in arid environments. Saccus rigidus is notable for its ecological role in supporting local insect and bird populations."
