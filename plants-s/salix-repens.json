    "intro": "Salix repens, commonly known as creeping willow, is a low-growing shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats or ground cover. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and elliptical, often with a silvery underside. Salix repens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in wet meadows."
