    "intro": "Stellaria wutaica, commonly known as the Wutaica starwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of East Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant features small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, giving it a star-like appearance. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Stellaria wutaica is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments."
