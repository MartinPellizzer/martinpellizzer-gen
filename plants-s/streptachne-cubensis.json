It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and disturbed areas. Botanically, it is notable for its rhizomatous growth and its role in stabilizing soil in riparian zones."
