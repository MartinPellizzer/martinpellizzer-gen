    "intro": "Spodiopogon foliatus var. erubescens, commonly known as the red-leaf spodiopogon, is a perennial grass species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that turn a striking red or reddish-purple color during the fall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening for its seasonal color change. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
