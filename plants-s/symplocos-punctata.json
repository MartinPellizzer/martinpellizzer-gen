It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often marked with distinctive red or purple spots. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. Symplocos punctata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
