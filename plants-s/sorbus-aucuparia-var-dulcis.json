    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia var. dulcis, commonly known as the sweet mountain ash, is a variant of the common rowan tree. It is characterized by its small, edible berries that are sweeter than those of the typical Sorbus aucuparia. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in autumn, and produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring. Its fruits are often consumed by birds and can be used in jams or as a food source in certain regions. The tree typically grows in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or scrubland habitats."
