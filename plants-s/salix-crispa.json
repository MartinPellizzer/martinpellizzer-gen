    "intro": "Salix crispa, commonly known as the crinkled willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and distinctive, finely serrated leaves that are usually a dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near watercourses. Salix crispa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological habitats."
