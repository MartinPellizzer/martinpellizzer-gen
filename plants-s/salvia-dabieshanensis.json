    "intro": "Salvia dabieshanensis, commonly known as Dabieshan sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. This species is notable for its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral structure, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
