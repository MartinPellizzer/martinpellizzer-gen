It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.
