    "intro": "Salix magnolioides, commonly known as the magnolia willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, often grayish bark and lance-shaped, bright green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are grouped in clusters and are typically male or female. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate wet conditions."
