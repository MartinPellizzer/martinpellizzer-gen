    "intro": "Salaxis flexuosa, commonly known as the zigzag lily, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, winding stems that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often arranged alternately along the stem. Salaxis flexuosa is typically found in moist, shaded woodlands and is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
