It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often display vibrant colors. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are zygomorphic, with three distinct petals and a specialized lip that aids in pollination.
