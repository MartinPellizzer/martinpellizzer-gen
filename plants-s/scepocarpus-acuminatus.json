It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berries that contain the seeds. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
