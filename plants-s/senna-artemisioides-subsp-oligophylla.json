    "intro": "Senna artemisioides subsp. oligophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf senna, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves with a distinctive pinnate structure. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in a fibrous pod, which splits open to release the seeds. This species is adapted to drought conditions and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
