    "intro": "Salix pseudolasiogyne var. bilofolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved willow, is a variant of the willow genus characterized by its distinctive foliage. This plant is native to specific regions in East Asia, where it thrives in moist, temperate environments. Its leaves are broad and lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. It is often found near water sources, such as streams and wetlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
