    "intro": "Silene mellifera var. nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra snowplant, is a perennial herb native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is characterized by its rosette of pale green, woolly leaves and produces striking pink to magenta flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in high-altitude, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold, dry conditions. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
