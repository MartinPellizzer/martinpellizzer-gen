It belongs to the Leguminosae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant produces woody pods that contain flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often found in moist, lowland forest environments and is valued for its timber. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
