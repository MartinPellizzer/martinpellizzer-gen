It is a perennial grass characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelets that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its deep root system and efficient water use. It is native to regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, where it often grows in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and potential applications in phytoremediation."
