    "intro": "Selaginella praelonga, commonly known as the long-stemmed spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a small, evergreen, herbaceous plant that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features a rosette of spirally arranged, needle-like leaves that are green and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces sporophytes with strobilae that bear spores, and it is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Selaginella praelonga is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions."
