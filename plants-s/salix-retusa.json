    "intro": "Salix retusa, commonly known as the silky willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its distinctive, silky-haired leaves that give it a soft, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and hang in clusters. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often peeling in thin strips, and it is often found near water sources such as streams and wetlands. Salix retusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in riparian areas."
