    "intro": "Sorbus commixta var. ulleungensis, commonly known as the Ulleung Island whitebeam, is a rare shrub or small tree native to the Korean island of Ulleungdo. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and consist of 5\u20137 elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
