    "intro": "Stegolepis minor, commonly known as the dwarf starflower, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stegolepis minor is considered a rare and endangered species."
