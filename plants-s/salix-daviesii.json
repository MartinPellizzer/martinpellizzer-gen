    "intro": "Salix daviesii, commonly known as the Sierra willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Salix daviesii thrives in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in riparian zones."
