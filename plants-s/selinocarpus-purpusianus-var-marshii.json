    "intro": "Selinocarpus purpusianus var. marshii, commonly known as the marshy selinocarpus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features elongated, grass-like leaves that are often clustered at the base, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. It is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting local biodiversity. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range."
