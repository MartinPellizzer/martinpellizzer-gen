    "intro": "Sabal nobilis, commonly known as the cabbage palm, is a tall, cold-hardy palm native to the southeastern United States. It features a slender trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown bark and large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to 10 feet in diameter. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into dark blue berries, which are edible but often consumed by birds. It is well adapted to wetland environments and is often found in swamps and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
