    "intro": "Salacia petenensis, commonly known as the Pet\u00e9n salacia, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to the genus Salacia. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, alternate leaves, and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain seeds, and the plant is often found in humid, lowland forests. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, Salacia petenensis is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
