    "intro": "Saponaria rubra, commonly known as red soapwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces woolly, hairy leaves that are often covered in a white, soapy substance, which gives it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Saponaria rubra is also valued for its medicinal properties and has been used historically for its cleansing and healing qualities."
