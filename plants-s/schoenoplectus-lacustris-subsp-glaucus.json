    "intro": "Schoenoplectus lacustris subsp. glaucus, commonly known as the glaucous bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically greenish or bluish in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
