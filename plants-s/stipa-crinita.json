    "intro": "Stipa crinita, commonly known as silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and distinctive, fluffy seed heads that resemble tufts of hair. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Stipa crinita is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ecological benefits."
