    "intro": "Simocheilus patulus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a thick, fleshy stem that helps it anchor in soft sediments. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense spikes, usually appearing in late spring to early summer. The species is valued for its role in wetland ecosystems, providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
