    "intro": "Schizoglossum masaicum, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often with a prominent central stigma. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Schizoglossum masaicum is often found growing in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy species well-suited to desert conditions."
