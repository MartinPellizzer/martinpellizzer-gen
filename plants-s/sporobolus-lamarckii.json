    "intro": "Sporobolus lamarckii, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, dense foliage and fine, blue-green blades. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to brown flowers. Sporobolus lamarckii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
