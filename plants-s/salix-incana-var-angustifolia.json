    "intro": "Salix incana var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in wetlands. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
