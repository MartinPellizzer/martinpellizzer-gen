It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color. The plant produces spikes of violet-blue flowers in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
