It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in axillary cymes, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for wetland gardens and natural landscapes."
