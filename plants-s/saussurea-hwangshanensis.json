    "intro": "Saussurea hwangshanensis, commonly known as the Hwangshan saffron, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Hwangshan Mountains in China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flower heads that resemble saffron, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in high-altitude rocky habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant is known for its medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
