    "intro": "Sinningia verticillata, commonly known as the violet plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate, hairy, and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Sinningia verticillata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
