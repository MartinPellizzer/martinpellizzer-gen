    "intro": "[WRONG START] Solidago rigidula, commonly known as stiff goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its upright, stiff stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. Solidago rigidula is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in gardens."
