    "intro": "Saprosma foetens subsp. ceylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon saprosma, is a small evergreen shrub native to Sri Lanka. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
