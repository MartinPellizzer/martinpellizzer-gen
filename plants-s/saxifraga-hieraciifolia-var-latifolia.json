    "intro": "Saxifraga hieraciifolia var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf rockfoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features rosettes of dark green, broad, ovate leaves with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in dense clusters atop the foliage. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas with high elevation. This variety is distinguished by its broader leaf shape compared to the typical form of Saxifraga hieraciifolia."
