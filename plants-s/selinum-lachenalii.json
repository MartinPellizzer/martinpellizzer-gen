    "intro": "Selinum lachenalii, commonly known as the Lachenal's garlic, is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers and pungent aroma. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, bulb-like structures similar to garlic. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in many areas."
