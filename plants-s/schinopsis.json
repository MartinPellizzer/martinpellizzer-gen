    "intro": "Schinopsis, commonly known as copal or quebracho, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to South America, particularly Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay, and are often found in dry, scrubland environments. Schinopsis species are characterized by their hard, woody stems and compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate. The genus includes several species, such as Schinopsis brasiliensis and Schinopsis lorentzii, which are valued for their durable wood and historical use in traditional medicine. Schinopsis plants also play an important ecological role in their native habitats, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
