    "intro": "Saxifraga coronensis, commonly known as the crown saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers arranged in a cluster at the center of the rosette. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra habitats. Saxifraga coronensis is a hardy species adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value."
