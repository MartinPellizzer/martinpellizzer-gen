    "intro": "Silphiosperma, commonly known as the silphium plant, is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its distinctive composite flower heads. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrived in dry, rocky soils, often growing along coastal areas. The plant features a tall, branching stem with narrow, gray-green leaves and produces yellow flowers that attract pollinators. Silphiosperma was historically cultivated for its medicinal properties, particularly for its resin, which was valued in ancient times. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered extinct in the wild."
