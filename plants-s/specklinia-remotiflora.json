    "intro": "Specklinia remotiflora, commonly known as the remote-flowered orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and clusters of small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Its leaves are typically elongated and strap-like, adapted to maximize light absorption in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
