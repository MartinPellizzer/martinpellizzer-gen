    "intro": "Swida alsophila, commonly known as the alpine swida, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils, often at elevations above 3,000 meters. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to withstand the cold and strong winds of its environment. Swida alsophila plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
