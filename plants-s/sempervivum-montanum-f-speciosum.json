    "intro": "Sempervivum montanum f. speciosum, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a compact, low-growing succulent with rosettes of fleshy, pointed leaves. The leaves are typically blue-green to silver-gray, often with red or pink tints under stress or in full sun. It produces upright stems bearing clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white. Native to the Alps, it thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and hardy nature, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
