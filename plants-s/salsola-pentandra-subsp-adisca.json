    "intro": "Salsola pentandra subsp. adisca, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a halophytic shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and small, greenish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it a common weed in disturbed areas. Its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, adapted to minimize water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing soils in arid environments but is often considered invasive in non-native regions."
