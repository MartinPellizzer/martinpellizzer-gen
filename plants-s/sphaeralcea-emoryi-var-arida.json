    "intro": "Sphaeralcea emoryi var. arida, commonly known as Emory's globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
