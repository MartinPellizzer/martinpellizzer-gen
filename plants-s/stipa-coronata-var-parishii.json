It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
