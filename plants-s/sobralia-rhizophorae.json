    "intro": "Sobralia rhizophorae, commonly known as the mangrove sobralia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South America. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is typically found growing in mangrove forests where it thrives in saline and humid environments. The plant features showy, fragrant flowers that are often yellow or orange in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are adapted to tolerate waterlogged and oxygen-poor soils, which is characteristic of its mangrove habitat. Sobralia rhizophorae plays a role in the ecological balance of coastal ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and stabilizing shorelines."
