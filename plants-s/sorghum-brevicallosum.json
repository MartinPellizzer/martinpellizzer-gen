    "intro": "Sorghum brevicallosum, commonly known as dwarf sorghum, is a grass species native to Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and short stature, typically reaching heights of less than one meter. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences known as panicles, which contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it thrives in warm, arid environments. Sorghum brevicallosum is often used in traditional landscaping and has some ornamental value due to its distinctive appearance."
