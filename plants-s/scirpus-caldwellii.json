    "intro": "Scirpus caldwellii, commonly known as Caldwell's bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to wetland stabilization."
