    "intro": "Schizocarpum attenuatum, commonly known as the slender schizocarp, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its umbellate inflorescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into dry, multi-seeded fruits called schizocarps. These fruits split into two parts when mature, aiding in seed dispersal. Schizocarpum attenuatum is often found in dry, open habitats and is valued for its ornamental potential."
