    "intro": "Sporobolus paucifolius, commonly known as the sparseleaf buffalograss, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in drought conditions. Sporobolus paucifolius is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
