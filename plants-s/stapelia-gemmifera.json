    "intro": "Stapelia gemmifera, commonly known as the carrion flower, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and its unique, odorless flowers that resemble decaying flesh. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that emit a strong, unpleasant smell to attract pollinators like flies. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic conditions. Stapelia gemmifera is also known for its ability to produce offsets, which contribute to its propagation and growth."
