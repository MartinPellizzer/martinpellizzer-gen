    "intro": "Sophronitis praestans, commonly known as the Ecuadorian orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It produces striking, showy flowers with bright yellow petals and a deep orange lip, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes and absorbing moisture from the air. Its flowers bloom in the summer months, and it requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive. Sophronitis praestans is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
