    "intro": "Salvia subscaposa, commonly known as the narrowleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces striking violet or blue-purple flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Salvia subscaposa is valued in both traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant for its hardiness and beauty."
