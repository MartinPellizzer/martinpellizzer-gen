    "intro": "Stenocline filaginoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf filagrate, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and small, compound leaves that are often finely divided. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
