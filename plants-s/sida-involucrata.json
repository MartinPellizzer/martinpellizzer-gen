    "intro": "Sida involucrata, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy stems and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces small, round, green fruits that contain seeds, and it thrives in sandy or disturbed soils. Sida involucrata is often found in arid and semi-arid environments, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in such regions. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of desert flora."
