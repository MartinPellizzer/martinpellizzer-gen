    "intro": "Sophronitis rossiteriana, commonly known as the Rossiter's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricately patterned flowers that resemble those of the genus Sophronitis. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or in rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually pale green or white with contrasting purple or brown markings, and it blooms during the cooler months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
