    "intro": "Saxifraga chumbiensis, commonly known as the Chumbi saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, particularly in Nepal and Bhutan. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, often on steep slopes and cliffs. The plant features basal leaves that are rhombic or ovate in shape, with a hairy texture adapted to the cold and arid conditions of its habitat. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, which bloom in the summer months. Saxifraga chumbiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
