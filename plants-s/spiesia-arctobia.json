    "intro": "Spiesia arctobia, commonly known as the Arctic willow, is a low-growing shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of North America. It is a deciduous plant that typically reaches heights of less than 1 meter, with small, lance-shaped leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are pollinated by insects. Its woody stems are covered in a dense layer of hair, which helps insulate the plant in cold environments. Spiesia arctobia plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for arctic wildlife."
