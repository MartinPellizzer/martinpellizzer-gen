    "intro": "Scirpus pentagonus, commonly known as the pentagonal bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers at the top of its stems, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its rhizomes are robust and help it spread vegetatively through wetland environments. Scirpus pentagonus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland species."
