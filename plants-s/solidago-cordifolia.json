The plant is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its showy, composite flower heads. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and prairies. Solidago cordifolia plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
