    "intro": "Strychnos usitata var. cirrosa, commonly known as the hairy strychnos, is a tropical shrub native to regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves with long, hairy stipules. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds. Its ornamental value is often appreciated in horticulture due to its unique foliage and growth habit. However, like other members of its genus, it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care."
