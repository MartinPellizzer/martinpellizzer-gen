    "intro": "Salix luteosericea, commonly known as the silky willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
