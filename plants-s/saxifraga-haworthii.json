    "intro": "Saxifraga haworthii, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in harsh conditions. Saxifraga hawworthii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
