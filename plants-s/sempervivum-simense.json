    "intro": "Sempervivum simense, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, thick leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil. Sempervivum simense is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its hardiness and attractive appearance."
