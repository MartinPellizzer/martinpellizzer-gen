    "intro": "Saponaria elisabethae, commonly known as the Elizabeth's soapwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of pink or lilac flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or borders. Saponaria elisabethae is also noted for its mild soap-like scent, which is derived from the saponin compounds present in its leaves."
