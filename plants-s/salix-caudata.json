    "intro": "Salix caudata, commonly known as the silky willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its grayish bark and slender, weeping branches that often droop with long, silky catkins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, which are followed by narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Salix caudata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
