    "intro": "Selinum vaginatum, commonly known as the common garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are aromatic when crushed. The plant produces small, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring, followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is known for its strong, garlic-like odor and has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive."
