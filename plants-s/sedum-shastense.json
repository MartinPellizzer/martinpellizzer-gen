    "intro": "Sedum shastense, commonly known as Shasta sedum, is a succulent plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that form a dense rosette. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum shastense is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
