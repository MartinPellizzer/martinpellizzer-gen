    "intro": "Sequoia sempervirens var. albospica, commonly known as the white-spotted redwood, is a rare variant of the coast redwood. It is characterized by its distinctive white or pale spots on the bark, which contrast with the typical reddish-brown color. This variety is found primarily in specific coastal areas of Northern California. The tree is a slow-growing evergreen with tall, straight trunks and a conical crown. It shares many botanical features with the common redwood, including its ability to thrive in moist, cool climates."
