It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces bright red, fleshy berries that resemble small cherries, which are edible and often used in local cuisines. Serjania lobulata is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal properties. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a leathery texture with a strong aromatic scent."
