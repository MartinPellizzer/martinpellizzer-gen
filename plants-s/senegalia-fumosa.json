    "intro": "Senegalia fumosa, commonly known as the smoke tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive gray-green foliage and the presence of small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it a smoky appearance. Senegalia fumosa is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock."
