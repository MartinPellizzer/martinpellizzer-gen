    "intro": "Sloanea pulvinata, commonly known as the Brazilian wax tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that give it its common name and help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by elliptical, woody fruits. Sloanea pulvinata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions. Its botanical features make it well adapted to coastal and dry forest environments."
