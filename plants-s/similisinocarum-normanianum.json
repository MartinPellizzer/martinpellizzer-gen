    "intro": "Similisinocarum normanianum, commonly known as the Normanian fern, is a prehistoric plant belonging to the fern group. It is characterized by its fronds, which were likely similar to those of modern ferns, with a complex vascular system. The plant thrived during the Cretaceous period, approximately 145 to 66 million years ago. Its fossils are often found in sedimentary rock layers, providing insights into ancient flora. The study of Similisinocarum normanianum helps scientists understand the evolution of plant life during the Mesozoic era."
