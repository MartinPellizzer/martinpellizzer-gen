    "intro": "Souroubea, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to Africa. These plants are characterized by their dense, velvety foliage and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. Souroubea species are typically evergreen and thrive in humid, well-drained soil conditions. They are popular as ornamental plants due to their compact growth habit and ability to bloom continuously throughout the year. The leaves are usually thick and waxy, which helps the plant retain moisture in its native environment."
