    "intro": "Spermacoce reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is an annual herb with slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, spherical, black berries. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a net-like venation pattern, giving it its scientific name. Spermacoce reticulata is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
