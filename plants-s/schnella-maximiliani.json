    "intro": "Schnella maximiliani, commonly known as the water violet, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water bodies such as ponds and lakes, where it forms dense, floating mats. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early summer. Its roots help stabilize sediment and improve water quality by filtering nutrients. Schnella maximiliani is an important species for aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat for various invertebrates and fish."
