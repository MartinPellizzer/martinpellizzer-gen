    "intro": "Senna neglecta var. furnicola, commonly known as the African senna, is a shrub native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are finely divided and give the plant a feathery appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its small, pod-like fruits contain several seeds that are dispersed by wind. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments."
