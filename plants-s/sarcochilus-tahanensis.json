    "intro": "Sarcochilus tahanensis, commonly known as the Tahan's ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and striking, showy flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it has limited genetic diversity, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival. Due to habitat destruction, it is critically threatened in the wild."
