    "intro": "Schistocarpha pedicellata, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, branched stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple. The plant produces small, oval, ribbed seeds within a schizocarp, which splits into segments upon maturity. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a notable species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
