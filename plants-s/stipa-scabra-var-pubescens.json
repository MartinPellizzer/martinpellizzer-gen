    "intro": "Stipa scabra var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
