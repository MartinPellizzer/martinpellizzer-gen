It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves and showy, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in the evening. The plant produces small, toxic berries that are often used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, temperate climates and well-drained soils. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
