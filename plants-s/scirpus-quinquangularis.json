    "intro": "Scirpus quinquangularis, commonly known as the five-angled bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its triangular, ridged stems that are often used in basket weaving due to their strength and flexibility. The plant produces small, clustered brown flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from August to September. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. Scirpus quinquangularis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
