    "intro": "Sagittaria sagittifolia var. vulgaris, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the eastern United States. It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically floating or submerged, depending on water conditions. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom above the water surface. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily and form dense vegetation."
