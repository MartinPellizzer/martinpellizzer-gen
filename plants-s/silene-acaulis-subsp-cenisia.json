    "intro": "Silene acaulis subsp. cenisia, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in a compact cluster at the center of the rosette. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
