    "intro": "Selinum turfosum, commonly known as turfgrass selenium, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in early spring. Selinum turfosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
