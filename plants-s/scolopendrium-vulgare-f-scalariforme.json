    "intro": "Scolopendrium vulgare f. scalariforme, commonly known as the scalloped clubmoss, is a rare variant of the common clubmoss. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant features closely packed, scale-like leaves that form a dense, compact rosette. It produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobila, which are typically found at the base of the plant. This fern is often found in rocky, acidic soils and is considered a relic species with limited distribution."
