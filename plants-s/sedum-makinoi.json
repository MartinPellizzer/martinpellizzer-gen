    "intro": "Sedum makinoi, commonly known as Makino's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Japan. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum makinoi is also valued for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
