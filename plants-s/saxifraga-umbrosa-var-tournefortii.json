    "intro": "Saxifraga umbrosa var. tournefortii, commonly known as the Alpine saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features rosettes of dark green, velvety leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and partial shade."
