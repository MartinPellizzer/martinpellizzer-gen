    "intro": "Stenocarpus milnei, commonly known as the silky oak, is a member of the Proteaceae family and is native to eastern Australia. It is a large, evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits that contain several seeds. Its root system is fibrous and helps it thrive in well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. The silky oak is also valued for its durable timber and is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental appearance."
