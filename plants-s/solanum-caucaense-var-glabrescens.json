    "intro": "Solanum caucaense var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth caucaense nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Colombia and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other varieties in the species. Its flowers are typically blue or violet, and it produces small, toxic berries that are edible when ripe. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential medicinal properties."
