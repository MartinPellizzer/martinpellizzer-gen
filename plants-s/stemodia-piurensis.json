    "intro": "Stemodia piurensis, commonly known as the Piura stemodia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the high-altitude climate of its native range. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
