    "intro": "Schistostephium artemisiifolium subsp. marungensis, commonly known as the Marungensis stephium, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those of the genus Artemisia, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, branched clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
