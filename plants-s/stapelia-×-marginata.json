    "intro": "Stapelia \u00d7 marginata, commonly known as the Ghost Plant, is a hybrid succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and distinctive, star-shaped flowers that resemble dead leaves. The plant produces pale yellow or greenish-white blooms with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are typically narrow and pointed, and it is often grown as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance. Stapelia \u00d7 marginata is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright light and well-draining soil."
