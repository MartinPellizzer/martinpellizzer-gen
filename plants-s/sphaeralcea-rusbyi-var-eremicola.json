It is characterized by its globular shape, with numerous small, yellow flowers clustered at the top of the plant. The species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating high drought tolerance. Its leaves are typically small, hairy, and arranged in a rosette pattern to reduce water loss.
