    "intro": "Salix cataonica, commonly known as the Crimean willow, is a shrub native to the Crimean Peninsula and surrounding regions of southern Ukraine and Turkey. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, elongated leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and lakes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
