    "intro": "Serapias perez-chiscanoi f. leucoglottis, commonly known as the white-veined marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring white-veined petals and a distinctive, often yellow or orange-colored lip. The plant typically grows in wet, calcareous habitats such as marshes and damp meadows, where it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, requiring conservation efforts to protect its natural environment. Its botanical features make it an important subject for studies on orchid evolution and ecological adaptation."
