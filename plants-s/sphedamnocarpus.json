    "intro": "Sphedamnocarpus, commonly known as the blackberry lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a dark, almost black, upper surface that is covered in a layer of tiny, raised bumps called pseudocortex. The lower surface is usually lighter in color and features a network of fine, leaf-like structures called rhizines. This lichen is often found on tree trunks, rocks, and soil in temperate regions. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important indicator of environmental conditions."
