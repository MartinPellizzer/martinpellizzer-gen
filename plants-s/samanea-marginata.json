    "intro": "Samanea marginata, commonly known as the white senna, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive white margin, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, upright clusters, followed by flat, bean-like pods. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has a shallow root system that makes it suitable for erosion control. Samanea marginata is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, contributing to soil fertility in agricultural settings."
