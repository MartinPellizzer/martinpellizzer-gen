It features a tall, cylindrical stem with a ribbed structure and spines that are often reduced or absent. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem. Its growth habit and unique appearance make it a distinctive and resilient species in desert ecosystems."
