    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum var. recurvatum, commonly known as the curly leaf potato, is a variant of the potato plant characterized by its unique, curling foliage. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is native to the Andes region of South America. The plant produces tubers that are typically smaller and have a more complex flavor profile compared to common potatoes. Its ornamental leaves make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking both aesthetic and edible value. However, it is less commonly cultivated for commercial farming due to its lower yield and specific growing requirements."
