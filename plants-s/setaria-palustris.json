    "intro": "Setaria palustris, commonly known as swamp millet, is a grass species native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist to saturated soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife."
