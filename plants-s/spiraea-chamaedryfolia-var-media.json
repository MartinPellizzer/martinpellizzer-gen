    "intro": "Spiraea chamaedryfolia var. media, commonly known as the compact spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, slender stems that bear clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early to mid-summer. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that provide a striking contrast to its floral display. It is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, or as a specimen plant due to its compact growth habit. The foliage turns red or bronze in the fall, adding seasonal interest to the landscape."
