    "intro": "Synotis palmatisecta, commonly known as the broadleaf synotis, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that give it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by fruit that contains several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
