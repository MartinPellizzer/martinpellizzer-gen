    "intro": "Stenanthemum pumilum subsp. pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf stenanthemum, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of Western Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters, featuring dense, compact foliage with small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It is well adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden coastal environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in coastal gardens and conservation areas."
