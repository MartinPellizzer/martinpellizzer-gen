    "intro": "Selaginella urquiolae, commonly known as the Urquillo's spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and the presence of spores in specialized structures called strobila. Native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized cellular structures. Its conservation status is vulnerable, making it a subject of interest for botanical research and conservation efforts."
