    "intro": "Saxifraga stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features small, clustered leaves and produces delicate white or pink flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to harsh climates, with a compact growth form that helps it withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Saxifraga stenophylla plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
