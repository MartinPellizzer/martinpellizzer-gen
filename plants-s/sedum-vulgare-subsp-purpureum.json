    "intro": "Sedum vulgare subsp. purpureum, commonly known as purple stonecrop, is a perennial succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and leaves that are typically green with a reddish or purplish hue, especially under stress or in full sun. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or purple, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ability to spread via offsets make it a hardy and low-maintenance plant."
