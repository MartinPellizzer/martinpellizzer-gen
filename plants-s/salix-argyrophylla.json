    "intro": "Salix argyrophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, yellowish female flowers. It thrives in moist environments such as streambanks and wetlands. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an important species in riparian ecosystems."
