    "intro": "Styrax nervosus var. elongatus, commonly known as the long-leaf styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, woody capsules containing the seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, and it prefers moist, well-drained soils in partial to full shade. It is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
