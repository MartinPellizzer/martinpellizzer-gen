    "intro": "Stevia oligophylla, commonly known as the lesser stevia, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, green, serrated leaves. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and climates, making it a hardy species. Its leaves contain high levels of steviol glycosides, which are used as natural sweeteners. However, unlike its more widely known relative, Stevia rebaudiana, it is less commonly cultivated for commercial use."
