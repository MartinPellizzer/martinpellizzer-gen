    "intro": "Stellaria holostea, commonly known as the creeping starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers with five petals arranged in a star-like pattern, which gives it its common name. The plant has slender, branched stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. Stellaria holostea typically thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
