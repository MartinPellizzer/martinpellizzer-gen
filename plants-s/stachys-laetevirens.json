    "intro": "Stachys laetevirens, commonly known as the happy green hedge-nettle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to violet flowers in late summer, which are borne on slender, erect spikes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Stachys laetevirens is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
