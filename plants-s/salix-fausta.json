    "intro": "Salix fausta, commonly known as the golden willow, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia, including China and the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and bright yellow catkins that appear in early spring. The tree has small, oval leaves that turn yellow in the fall, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. Due to its unique appearance and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
