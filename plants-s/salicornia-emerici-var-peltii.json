It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often red or pink in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and estuaries, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms. Its morphology and physiology make it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects in salt-affected soils."
