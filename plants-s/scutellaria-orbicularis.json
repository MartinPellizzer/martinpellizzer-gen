It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive orbicular-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
