    "intro": "Smilax oblonga, commonly known as the longleaf smilax, is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States. It features a climbing habit with thorned stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits. Smilax oblonga is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its persistent foliage and unique morphology make it a notable component of its native ecosystem."
