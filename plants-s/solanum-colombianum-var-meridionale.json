    "intro": "Solanum colombianum var. meridionale, commonly known as the southern Colombian nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. Its fruits are berries that change color from green to red as they mature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
