    "intro": "Silene indica var. bhutanica, commonly known as the Bhutan pink, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Bhutan. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky slopes. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
