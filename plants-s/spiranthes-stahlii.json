    "intro": "Spiranthes stahlii, commonly known as the Stahli's spiral orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, spiral arrangement of white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in woodlands and wetlands, often forming dense clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish colonies over time. The species is notable for its unique floral structure and is often found in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake."
