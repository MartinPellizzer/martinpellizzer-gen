    "intro": "Stelis zootrophionoides, commonly known as the Zootrophionoides orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other objects without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Stelis zootrophionoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
