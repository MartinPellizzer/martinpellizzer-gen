    "intro": "Schischkinia albispina, commonly known as the white-spined cycad, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a waxy, white coating. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically growing on separate plants. Schischkinia albispina is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water. Due to its striking appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable and somewhat rare ornamental plant."
