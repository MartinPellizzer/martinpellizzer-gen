    "intro": "Specularia, commonly known as fairy rings or ghost flowers, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, bell-shaped flowers that often appear in clusters, typically in shades of pink, white, or purple. Specularia species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North America. They thrive in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, often found in meadows and woodland edges. The flowers are short-lived, blooming for only a few weeks in the spring or early summer."
