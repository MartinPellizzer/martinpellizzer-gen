    "intro": "Schoenus radiatus, commonly known as the radiate sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense clumps, and it produces small, clustered flower heads during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. Schoenus radiatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
