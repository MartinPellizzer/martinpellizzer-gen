    "intro": "Saxifraga pentadactylis f. stenoloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, thriving in cold, sunny environments. The plant features a low-growing rosette of linear, often hairy leaves that are narrower than the typical form. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to harsh climates, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
