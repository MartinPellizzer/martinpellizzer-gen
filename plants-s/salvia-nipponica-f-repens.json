    "intro": "Salvia nipponica f. repens, commonly known as Japanese creeping sage, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Japan. It features slender, creeping stems that form a dense mat of foliage, often reaching heights of less than 10 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of violet to purple flowers during the summer months, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained, sunny to partially shaded soils. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its hardiness and ability to spread effectively in suitable conditions."
