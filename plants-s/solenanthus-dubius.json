    "intro": "Solenanthus dubius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved solenanthus, is a flowering plant native to the island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean. It is a small shrub characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
