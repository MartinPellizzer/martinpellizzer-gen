    "intro": "Smelowskia lineariloba, commonly known as the linear-leaved smelowskia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cool, temperate climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
