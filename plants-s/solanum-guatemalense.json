It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to red, fleshy berries. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or edible purposes."
