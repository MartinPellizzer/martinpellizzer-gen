    "intro": "Sarcoclinium sessilifolium, commonly known as the sessile-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the eastern United States. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet or blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a petiole. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a notable species for both ecological and horticultural purposes."
