    "intro": "Salix sibirica var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth Siberian willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and lance-shaped leaves that are smooth on both sides. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riverbanks and wetlands. This variety is notable for its hardiness and adaptability to harsh climates."
