    "intro": "Sedum rhodiola var. tenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stonecrop, is a succulent plant characterized by its fleshy, narrow leaves and compact growth habit. It is native to arid and rocky environments in regions such as the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. The plant's leaves are typically arranged in a rosette, allowing it to store water efficiently. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which attract pollinators. This variety is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
