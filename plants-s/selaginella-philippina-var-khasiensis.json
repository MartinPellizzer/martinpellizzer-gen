    "intro": "Selaginella philippina var. khasiensis, commonly known as the Khasi spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to the northeastern region of India. This plant is a small, evergreen, terrestrial moss-like plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. It features a compact rosette of closely packed, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores for reproduction. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important species in the study of bryophyte diversity."
