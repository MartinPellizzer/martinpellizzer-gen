    "intro": "Schomburgkia marginata, commonly known as the marginate cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Schomburgkia marginata is a slow-growing plant that prefers well-drained, sandy soils and full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
