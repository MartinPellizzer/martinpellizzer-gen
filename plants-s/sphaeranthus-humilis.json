It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as deserts and rocky areas. Sphaeranthus humilis is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions."
