    "intro": "Sesuvium portulaca, commonly known as sea purslane, is a halophyte plant adapted to thrive in saline environments. It has succulent, fleshy leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and along roadsides where it tolerates high salinity and poor soil conditions. Its root system helps stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control. Sesuvium portulaca is also valued for its nutritional content and is used in some traditional cuisines."
