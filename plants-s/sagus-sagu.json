    "intro": "Sagus sagu, commonly known as sago palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered with smooth, waxy bark. The plant produces large, feather-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. The sago palm is known for its ability to store starch in its trunk, which is harvested for food. Its botanical structure makes it well-adapted to humid, tropical environments."
