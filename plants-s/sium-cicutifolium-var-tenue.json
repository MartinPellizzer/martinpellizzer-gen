    "intro": "Sium cicutifolium var. tenue, commonly known as slender water parsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often along the edges of ponds or streams. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. Its roots are similar to those of the common water parsnip but are generally thinner and less robust. This variety is often found in temperate regions of North America and is adapted to moist, nutrient-rich soils."
