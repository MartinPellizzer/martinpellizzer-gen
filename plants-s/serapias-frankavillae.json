    "intro": "Serapias frankavillae, commonly known as the Frankavilla orchid, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the mountainous regions of southern Italy. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring brightly colored petals and a distinctive labellum. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone substrates, thriving in well-drained, sunny environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a splash of color to its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Serapias frankavillae is considered a vulnerable species."
