It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a tall, branching stem that bears yellow flowers. The plant is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Sonchus reflexus is an annual herb that often spreads through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
