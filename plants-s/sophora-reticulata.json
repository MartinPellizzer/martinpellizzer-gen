    "intro": "Sophora reticulata, commonly known as the Chinese wisteria, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive reticulate venation pattern. The plant produces long, pendulous racemes of fragrant, violet-blue flowers in late spring. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, leathery pods that split open to release the seeds. Sophora reticulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its showy blooms and adaptability to various soil types."
