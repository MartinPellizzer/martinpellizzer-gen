    "intro": "Sorbus chamaemespilus var. discolor, commonly known as the white-leaf rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its finely textured, white-veined leaves that turn red or orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value is due to its unique foliage and seasonal color changes."
