    "intro": "Salvia mellifera subsp. revoluta, commonly known as the Mexican blue sage, is a perennial shrub native to the central and southern regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Its nectar-rich flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological biodiversity. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly revolute (rolled under) leaf margins, a feature that aids in reducing water loss in arid environments."
