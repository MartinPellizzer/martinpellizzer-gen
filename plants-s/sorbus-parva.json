    "intro": "Sorbus parva, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 2 to 5 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, grayish-brown bark. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by orange to red berries that are a food source for birds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic to ovate in shape, with finely serrated margins. Sorbus parva is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and rocky areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
