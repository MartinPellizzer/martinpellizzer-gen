    "intro": "Sedum nutans, commonly known as the nodding sedum, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a succulent species characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves and clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its unique habit of nodding toward the ground when in bloom gives it its common name. Sedum nutans is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
