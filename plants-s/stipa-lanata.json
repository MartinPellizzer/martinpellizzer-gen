    "intro": "Stipa lanata, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray leaves covered in dense, silky hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale green or brown flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Stipa lanata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
