    "intro": "Sphaeralcea pumila, commonly known as the dwarf globemallow, is a low-growing annual herb native to the western United States. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in dry, open habitats like grasslands and disturbed areas. Its leaves are hairy and alternate, with a distinctive rounded shape. Sphaeralcea pumila is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
