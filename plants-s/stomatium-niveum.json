    "intro": "Stomatium niveum, commonly known as the snow-stoma, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has a short stem with a single, prominent inflorescence at the top. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it a frosty appearance. Stomatium niveum is adapted to thrive in cold, nutrient-poor soils and requires specific environmental conditions to survive."
