    "intro": "Stephegyne parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically small and velvety in texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often opening in the early morning. Its rapid growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental use in gardens and as a living fence. However, it is considered invasive in some areas due to its aggressive spreading nature."
