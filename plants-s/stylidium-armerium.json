It belongs to the family Haemodoraceae and is characterized by its distinctive, three-lobed leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers that are clustered in spikes, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Stylidium armerium is adapted to arid conditions and is known for its ability to store water in its succulent-like leaves."
