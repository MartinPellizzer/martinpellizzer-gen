    "intro": "Solanum incanum var. brevitomentosum, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by berry-like fruits, which are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by livestock and humans."
