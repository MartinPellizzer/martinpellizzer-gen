    "intro": "Salix taraikensis var. oblanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy on the upper surface. The leaves are usually 3\u20138 cm long and have a pointed tip, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forest margins."
