    "intro": "Silene nana, commonly known as dwarf campion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It features small, pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. The plant has a rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. It is often found in rocky soils and tundra habitats. Silene nana plays a role in supporting pollinators and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds."
