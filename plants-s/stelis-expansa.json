    "intro": "Stelis expansa, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a short, branched stem and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers with white to pale yellow petals. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Stelis expansa thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
