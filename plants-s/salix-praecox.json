    "intro": "Salix praecox, commonly known as early willow, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, wetlands, and woodland edges. The plant has slender, flexible stems and lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination and seed dispersal. Salix praecox is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
