    "intro": "Styphelia kingiana, commonly known as the King's heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, densely branched structure. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring, often clustered at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and evergreen, providing a dense, mat-like appearance. Styphelia kingiana is adapted to sandy, acidic soils and is often found in heathland and coastal heaths."
