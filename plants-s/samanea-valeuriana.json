    "intro": "Samanea valeuriana, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often have a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Samanea valeuriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its growth habit and foliage make it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
