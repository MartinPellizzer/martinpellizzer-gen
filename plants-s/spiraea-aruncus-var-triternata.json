    "intro": "Spiraea aruncus var. triternata, commonly known as the white meadow spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
