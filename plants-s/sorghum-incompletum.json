    "intro": "Sorghum incompletum, commonly known as the dwarf sorghum, is a small, shrub-like plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in traditional landscaping and as a source of forage for livestock."
