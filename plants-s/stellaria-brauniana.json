    "intro": "Stellaria brauniana, commonly known as the Braun's starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically features small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in star-like clusters, which give it its common name. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Stellaria brauniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
