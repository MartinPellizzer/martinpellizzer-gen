    "intro": "Sarothra gymnantha, commonly known as the slender sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed. It is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
