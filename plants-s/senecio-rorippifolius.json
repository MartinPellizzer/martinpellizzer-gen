    "intro": "Senecio rorippifolius, commonly known as the water lettuce, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of fleshy, waxy leaves that float on the surface of water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
