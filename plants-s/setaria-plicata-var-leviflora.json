It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
