    "intro": "Sorindeia multifoliolata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species."
