    "intro": "Salix repens var. argentea, commonly known as silver willow, is a variant of the creeping willow that features distinctive silvery-white undersides on its leaves. This plant is native to Europe and western Asia, often found in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and wet meadows. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, with a soft, feathery texture that contributes to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are typical of willow species and serve as the primary means of reproduction. It is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic qualities and ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
