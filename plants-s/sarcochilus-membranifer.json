    "intro": "Sarcochilus membranifer, commonly known as the membranous sarcocarp, is a species of orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Australia. It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often hairy pseudobulbs, which help store water in its arid habitat. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with red markings, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are usually broad and strap-like, adapted for efficient photosynthesis in shaded environments. Sarcochilus membranifer is a rare and endangered species, requiring specific conditions to thrive in cultivation."
