    "intro": "Selenicereus purpusii, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spineless stems and large, showy flowers that open at night. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine, often found in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are pale yellow to white, with a strong, sweet scent that attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths. Selenicereus purpusii is known for its ephemeral blooms, which last only a few hours before closing."
