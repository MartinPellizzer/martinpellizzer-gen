    "intro": "Selaginella palmiformis, commonly known as the palm fern, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like fronds. It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation and fire. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth form with small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its resilience and ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated as a decorative plant in dry environments."
