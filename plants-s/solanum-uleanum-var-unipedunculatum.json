    "intro": "Solanum uleanum var. unipedunculatum, commonly known as the single-stem nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its simple, hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into berry-like fruits, which are typically green when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic properties, it is rarely cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
