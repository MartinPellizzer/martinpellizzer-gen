It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and striking red or purplish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often gray-green in color, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Salvia rubescens is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
