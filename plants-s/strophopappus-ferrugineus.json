It is a small shrub characterized by its dense, woody stems and hairy leaves. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive bristly, feathery seed heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely used in horticulture."
