    "intro": "Stipa \u00d7 caduca, commonly known as the hybrid wheatgrass, is a sterile, perennial grass that results from the cross between Stipa capillata and Stipa tenuifolia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant produces dense, cylindrical spikelets that are typically arranged in panicles, giving it a distinctive appearance. Stipa \u00d7 caduca is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its hybrid nature, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest in botanical studies for its genetic diversity."
