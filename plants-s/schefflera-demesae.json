    "intro": "Schefflera demesae, commonly known as the mountain schefflera, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of Mexico. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with multiple leaflets arranged in a distinctive umbrella-like pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are typically followed by spherical berries. Schefflera demesae thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a notable species in botanical studies."
