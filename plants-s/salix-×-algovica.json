    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 algovica, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a natural hybrid between Salix cinerea and Salix fragilis, resulting in a plant with unique morphological characteristics. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly serrated edge. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are important for pollination by wind. This species is often found in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and in wetlands."
