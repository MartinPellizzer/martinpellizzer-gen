    "intro": "Scyphellandra, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and is characterized by its unique, umbrella-like inflorescence. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Scyphellandra is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its distinctive morphology and ecological role in its native habitats."
