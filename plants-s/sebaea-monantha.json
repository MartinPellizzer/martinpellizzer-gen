    "intro": "Sebaea monantha, commonly known as the white star vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in umbels, giving it a star-like appearance. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Sebaea monantha is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
