    "intro": "Solidago georgiana, commonly known as the Georgia goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in woodlands and along streambanks. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Solidago georgiana plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the late growing season."
