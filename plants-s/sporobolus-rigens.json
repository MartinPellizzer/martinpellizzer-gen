    "intro": "Sporobolus rigens, commonly known as wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to the United States, particularly in the southeastern region. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and wiry, stiff blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Wiregrass thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its ability to form dense stands makes it an important component of native plant communities and a valuable forage species."
