    "intro": "Sorbus gayeriana, commonly known as the Gayer's whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its smooth, grey-barked trunk and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically red or orange in color, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. The leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
