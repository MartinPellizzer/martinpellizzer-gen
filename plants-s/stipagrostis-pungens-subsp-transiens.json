    "intro": "Stipagrostis pungens subsp. transiens, commonly known as the Transient Needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to survive in drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. This subspecies is often found in sandy or rocky soils and plays a role in stabilizing sandy environments."
