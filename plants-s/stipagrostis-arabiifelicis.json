    "intro": "Stipagrostis arabiifelicis, commonly known as the Arabian needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and can thrive in poor soils with low water availability. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
