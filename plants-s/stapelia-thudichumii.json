    "intro": "Stapelia thudichumii, commonly known as the \"Carrion Flower,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and distinctive, meaty-looking flowers that resemble decaying flesh. The plant produces large, yellowish-green blooms with prominent veins, which emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators like flies. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Stapelia thudichumii is a popular choice for collectors due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
