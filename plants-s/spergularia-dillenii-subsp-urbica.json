    "intro": "Spergularia dillenii subsp. urbica, commonly known as the urban sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe. It typically thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, often found in urban environments such as roadsides and disturbed areas. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is often found in association with other xerophytic species. It is adapted to harsh conditions and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
