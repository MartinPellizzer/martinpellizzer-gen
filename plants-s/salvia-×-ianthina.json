    "intro": "Salvia \u00d7 ianthina, commonly known as the purple mistflower, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, which help reduce water loss in its native arid environments. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees. Salvia \u00d7 ianthina prefers full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a versatile choice for xeriscaping."
