    "intro": "Silene mollis, commonly known as the soft catchfly, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Silene mollis thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as heaths and grasslands. It is also known for its medicinal properties, having been used traditionally for its soothing effects on skin irritations."
