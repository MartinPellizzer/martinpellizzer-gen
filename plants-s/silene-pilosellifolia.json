    "intro": "Silene pilosellifolia, commonly known as the woolly catchfly, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant features a low-growing habit with hairy stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Silene pilosellifolia is often found in open, disturbed habitats and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds."
