    "intro": "Salvia rectiflora, commonly known as the straight-flowered sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of violet to blue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and long-lasting blooms make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable."
