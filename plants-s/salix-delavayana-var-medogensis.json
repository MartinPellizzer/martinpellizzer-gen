    "intro": "Salix delavayana var. medogensis, commonly known as the Yunnan willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in high-altitude environments. The leaves are typically narrow and lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly serrated edge. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are an important food source for pollinators. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
