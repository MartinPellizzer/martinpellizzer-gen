    "intro": "Stemonurus salicifolius, commonly known as the willow-leaf stemonurus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a soft, silvery underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Stemonurus salicifolius thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
