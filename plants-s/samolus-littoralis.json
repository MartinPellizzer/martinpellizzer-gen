    "intro": "Samolus littoralis, commonly known as the coastal samolus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shores, estuaries, and salt marshes, showcasing its adaptability to saline environments. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in a fine, hairy texture that aids in moisture retention. Samolus littoralis plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local biodiversity."
