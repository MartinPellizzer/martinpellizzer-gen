    "intro": "Sida multiflora, commonly known as coastal sida, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is an annual herb that grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are oval-shaped with a rough texture. Sida multiflora has a shallow root system and is adapted to salt spray and high sunlight exposure. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
