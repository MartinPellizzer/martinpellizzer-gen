    "intro": "Sanguisorba muricata var. platylopha, commonly known as the flat-leaf sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features upright, branching stems that are typically covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. This variety is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
