    "intro": "Sabulina verna subsp. kabylica, commonly known as the spring rock violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny habitats. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, dark green leaves and produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers in early spring. Its flowers are usually arranged in a raceme and are adapted for pollination by insects. The subspecies is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences from other subspecies of Sabulina verna."
