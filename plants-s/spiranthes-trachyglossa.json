It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. The plant produces delicate, spiral-shaped flowers that are usually pale green to white in color. It has a rhizomatous root system and lacks true leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. This orchid is often found in association with other orchid species and is known for its subtle, inconspicuous appearance."
