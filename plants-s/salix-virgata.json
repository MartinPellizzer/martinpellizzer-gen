    "intro": "Salix virgata, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and finely toothed, gray-green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. Salix virgata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
