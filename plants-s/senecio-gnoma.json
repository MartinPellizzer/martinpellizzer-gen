    "intro": "Senecio gnoma, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of yellow flowers. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Senecio gnoma is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
