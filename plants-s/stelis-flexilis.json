    "intro": "Stelis flexilis, commonly known as the flexible stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on tree branches or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. The plant features a short, compact stem with numerous clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Stelis flexilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
