    "intro": "Setaria affinis, commonly known as slender barnyardgrass, is a grass species native to Africa but now widely distributed across temperate regions. It is a herbaceous annual plant that typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelets that bear small, two-lobed bracts. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, and it is often found in disturbed soils, fields, and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
