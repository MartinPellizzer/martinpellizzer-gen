    "intro": "Saxifraga jacquemontiana, commonly known as the Alpine saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in spring, which are typically borne on elongated stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Saxifraga jacquemontiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
