    "intro": "Solanum gaudichaudii, commonly known as the Guadaloupe nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom at night. The plant produces berries that range in color from yellow to red, containing seeds that are dispersed by animals. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
