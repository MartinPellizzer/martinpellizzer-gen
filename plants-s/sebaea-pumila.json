    "intro": "Sebaea pumila, commonly known as the dwarf sebaea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Sebaea pumila is noted for its hardiness and ability to withstand drought conditions."
