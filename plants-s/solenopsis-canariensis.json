    "intro": "Solenopsis canariensis, commonly known as the Canary Islands antplant, is a unique species native to the Canary Islands. It is a hemiparasitic plant that forms a symbiotic relationship with ants, providing them with shelter and food while absorbing nutrients from their colony. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth habit with small, needle-like leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pink, and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its specialized ecological role, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
