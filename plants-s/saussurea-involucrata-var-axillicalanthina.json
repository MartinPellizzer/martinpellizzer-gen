It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces a distinctive, aromatic resin that is harvested for its medicinal and culinary uses. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered with fine hairs, adapting to the cold, arid conditions of its habitat.
