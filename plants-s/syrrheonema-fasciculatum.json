It is characterized by its dense, clustered fronds that give it a compact appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil surfaces. The fronds are usually leathery and have a distinctive, intricate pattern of veins."
