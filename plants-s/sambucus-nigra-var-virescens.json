    "intro": "Sambucus nigra var. virescens, commonly known as red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, bell-shaped white or greenish-yellow flowers that appear in early summer. The plant produces dark purple berries in late summer, which are edible when fully ripe but contain toxic compounds when unripe. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven leaflets, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is hardy in USDA zones 4 to 8."
