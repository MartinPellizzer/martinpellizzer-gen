    "intro": "Smilax scobinicaulis var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed catbrier, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny projections, which help it climb and protect itself from herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a distinctive, wavy margin. This variant is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
