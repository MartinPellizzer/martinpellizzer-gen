It is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are glossy on top and slightly hairy underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, sour fruits resembling small, elongated pods. Syzygium subcrenatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the use of its fruit in traditional cuisines. Its growth habit and foliage make it a popular choice for hedges and ornamental landscaping in warm climates."
