    "intro": "Syngonanthus garimpensis, commonly known as the Garimpo candelabra, is a species of flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its branched, shrub-like structure and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant's leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
