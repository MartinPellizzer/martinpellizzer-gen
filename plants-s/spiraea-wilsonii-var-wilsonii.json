    "intro": "Spiraea wilsonii var. wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and they turn red or orange in the fall. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
