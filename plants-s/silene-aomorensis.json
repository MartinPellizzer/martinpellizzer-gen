    "intro": "Silene aomorensis, commonly known as the Aomorensis campion, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of northern China. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and showy pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shorelines, where it tolerates saline conditions. Silene aomorensis is often found in maritime climates and is adapted to withstand strong winds and tidal influences. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural settings."
