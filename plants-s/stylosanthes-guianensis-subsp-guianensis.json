It is characterized by its erect or semi-erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It is well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often used in forage systems due to its high nutritional value. The species is also valued for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
