    "intro": "Saussurea ledebourii, commonly known as the Tibetan safflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy yellow ray flowers. The plant produces small, achene-like fruits that are dispersed by wind, a common adaptation in alpine environments. It thrives in cold, arid conditions and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its unique ecological role and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
