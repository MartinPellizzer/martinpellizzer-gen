    "intro": "Serratula angulata, commonly known as the angular sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has alternate, serrated leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by fluffy, seed-filled capitula. Serratula angulata is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions."
