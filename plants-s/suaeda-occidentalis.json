    "intro": "Suaeda occidentalis, commonly known as western saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in saline soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that store water, and its flowers are typically greenish-yellow, appearing in clusters. It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal and desert soils. Suaeda occidentalis is also valued for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to accumulate heavy metals."
