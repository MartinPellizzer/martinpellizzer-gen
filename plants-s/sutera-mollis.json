    "intro": "Sutera mollis, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and can spread extensively, making it a persistent weed in agricultural areas. Sutera mollis is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sunlight."
