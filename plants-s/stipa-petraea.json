    "intro": "Stipa petraea, commonly known as rockgrass, is a perennial grass native to rocky and arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Stipa petraea thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in limestone or sandy habitats. Its ability to colonize harsh environments makes it an important component of ecological succession in degraded landscapes."
