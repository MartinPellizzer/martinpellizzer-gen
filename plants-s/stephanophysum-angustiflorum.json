    "intro": "Stephanophysum angustiflorum, commonly known as the narrow-flowered stephanophysum, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States, typically found in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive, fern-like appearance. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbrella-like clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
