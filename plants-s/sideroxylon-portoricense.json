    "intro": "Sideroxylon portoricense, commonly known as the Cuban ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It belongs to the family Olacaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Sideroxylon portoricense also produces small, fragrant flowers followed by fleshy, red berries that attract various bird species."
