    "intro": "Saxifraga sedoides subsp. prenja, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It typically forms dense cushions or mats, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a raceme. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Saxifraga sedoides subsp. prenja is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
