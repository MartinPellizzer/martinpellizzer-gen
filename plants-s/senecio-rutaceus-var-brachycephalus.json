    "intro": "Senecio rutaceus var. brachycephalus, commonly known as the compact senecio, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features compact, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a slight blue or grayish tint. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
