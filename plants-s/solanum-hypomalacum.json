    "intro": "Solanum hypomalacum, commonly known as the Malacca nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, and thrives in tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its small, egg-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at night. Its fruit is a small, smooth, yellow berry that turns red when ripe, containing several seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated for agricultural purposes."
