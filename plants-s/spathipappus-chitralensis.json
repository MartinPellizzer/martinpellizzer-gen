    "intro": "Spathipappus chitralensis, commonly known as the Chitral spathipappus, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of northern Pakistan. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves and produces elongated, spathelike bracts that enclose its small, yellowish flowers. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
