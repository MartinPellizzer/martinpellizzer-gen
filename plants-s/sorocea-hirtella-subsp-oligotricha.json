It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, short hairs. Its small, white to pale green flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences. The subspecies is distinguished by its reduced leaf trichomes and shorter, more compact growth habit compared to other members of the species."
