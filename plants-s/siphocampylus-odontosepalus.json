    "intro": "Siphocampylus odontosepalus, commonly known as the toothed sepal orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring prominently toothed sepals that give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually small and greenish-white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
