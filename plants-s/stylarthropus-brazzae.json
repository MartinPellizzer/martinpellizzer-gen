    "intro": "Stylarthropus brazzae, commonly known as the Brazza's stylarthropus, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to specific regions of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its distinctive floral structure. The plant features showy, pentamerous flowers with five petals and a prominent stamen cluster, which is a key botanical trait. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats and has adapted to thrive in humid tropical environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
