    "intro": "Solanum adenophorum var. indivisum, commonly known as the hairy nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and hairy stems, which are covered in fine, glandular trichomes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by berries that range in color from yellow to red. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas, where it can become invasive. Botanically, it belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is notable for its adaptability and potential allelopathic properties."
