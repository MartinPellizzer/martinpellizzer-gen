    "intro": "Smilax alpini, commonly known as the alpine smilax, is a perennial climbing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Aristolochiaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and spiny tendrils that aid in climbing. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in umbels, followed by berries that are typically red or black in color. Smilax alpini thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of tropical and subtropical flora."
