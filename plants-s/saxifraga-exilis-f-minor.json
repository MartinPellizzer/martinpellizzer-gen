    "intro": "Saxifraga exilis f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It features small, clustered leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine displays. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in horticultural settings."
