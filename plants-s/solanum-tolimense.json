    "intro": "Solanum tolimense, commonly known as the Tolima nightshade, is a species of flowering plant native to South America, particularly Colombia. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its erect or semi-woody growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by berries that mature to a dark blue or black color. Solanum tolimense is often found in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests and is valued for its ornamental qualities. However, like many members of the Solanaceae family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
