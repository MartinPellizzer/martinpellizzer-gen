    "intro": "Saxifraga muricola var. quinquenervis, commonly known as the five-veined saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with a hairy texture and prominent veins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, typically arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
