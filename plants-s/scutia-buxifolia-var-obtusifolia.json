    "intro": "Scutia buxifolia var. obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved scutia, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are broad and oval in shape, often with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its foliage provides year-round visual interest, especially in winter when it retains its color."
