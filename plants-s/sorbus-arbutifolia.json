    "intro": "Sorbus arbutifolia, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and small, glossy, dark green leaves that turn red or orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, bright red berries that are a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or rocky areas. Sorbus arbutifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
