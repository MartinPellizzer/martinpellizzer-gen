    "intro": "Sagittaria sagittifolia var. heterophylla, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic species characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate appearance to its habitat. Its leaves vary in shape depending on the water depth, with submerged leaves being more elongated and floating leaves broader. This variation in leaf morphology helps the plant adapt to different aquatic environments."
