    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 chlorocarpa, commonly known as the yellow willow, is a hybrid deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and bright yellow to golden-green leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetland areas. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
