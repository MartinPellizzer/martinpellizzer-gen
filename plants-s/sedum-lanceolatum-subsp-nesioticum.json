    "intro": "Sedum lanceolatum subsp. nesioticum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, such as gravelly slopes and dry meadows. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
