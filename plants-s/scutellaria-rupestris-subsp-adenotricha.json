    "intro": "Scutellaria rupestris subsp. adenotricha, commonly known as the hairy scutellaria, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, arranged in whorled clusters along the stems. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sun-exposed habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
