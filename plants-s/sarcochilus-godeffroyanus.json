    "intro": "Sarcochilus godeffroyanus, commonly known as the Godeffroy's sarcochilus, is a terrestrial orchid native to New Guinea. It features a sympodial growth habit with a short, stocky rhizome and a single, fleshy, greenish-white leaf. The plant produces a single, erect, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive, hooded labellum. It blooms in the summer months and is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
