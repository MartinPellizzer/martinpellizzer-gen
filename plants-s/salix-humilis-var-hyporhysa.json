    "intro": "Salix humilis var. hyporhysa, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It typically reaches heights of less than 30 centimeters and features slender, willow-like branches covered in small, oval leaves. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollination and seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value and ecological importance."
