    "intro": "Schoenissa, commonly known as the star sedge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. These plants typically grow in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Schoenissa species are often found in temperate regions and are adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The genus includes several species, each with unique morphological variations that aid in identification."
