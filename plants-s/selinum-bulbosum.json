    "intro": "Selinum bulbosum, commonly known as the globe artichoke, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a rosette of silver-gray, fuzzy leaves that are densely packed at the base. The plant produces a large, globe-shaped flower head that resembles an artichoke, with spiny bracts surrounding the central flower. Its botanical name reflects its bulbous base and its association with the genus *Selinum*, which includes other aromatic herbs. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
