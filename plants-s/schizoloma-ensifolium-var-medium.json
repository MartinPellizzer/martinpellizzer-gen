    "intro": "Schizoloma ensifolium var. medium, commonly known as the medium sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its long, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a popular choice for humid indoor settings. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps over time. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental value."
