    "intro": "Sansevieria elliptica, commonly known as the Narrow-leaf Snake Plant, is a succulent plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features upright, sword-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and dark green, often with a pale margin. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and requires minimal watering, making it highly adaptable. Its leaves are stiff and fibrous, which helps it store water efficiently. Sansevieria elliptica is also noted for its air-purifying properties, contributing to indoor air quality."
