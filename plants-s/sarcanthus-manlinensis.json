    "intro": "Sarcanthus manlinensis, commonly known as the Manlin's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and striking, pale violet flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Sarcanthus manlinensis is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it a valuable indicator species for ecosystem health. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
