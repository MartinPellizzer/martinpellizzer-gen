    "intro": "Saxifraga cernua var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features a mat-forming habit with rosettes of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters at the base of the stems, which bloom in early spring. One of its notable characteristics is viviparity, where the seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant, forming small plantlets that can be detached and grow independently. This adaptation allows it to colonize rocky and nutrient-poor environments effectively."
