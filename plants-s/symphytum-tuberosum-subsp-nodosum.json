    "intro": "Symphytum tuberosum subsp. nodosum, commonly known as the nodding comfrey, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its stout, fleshy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a thick, waxy cuticle. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers that are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
