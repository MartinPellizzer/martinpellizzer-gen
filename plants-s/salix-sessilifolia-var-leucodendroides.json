    "intro": "Salix sessilifolia var. leucodendroides, commonly known as the white-leaf willow, is a variant of the sessilifolia willow species. It is characterized by its distinctive white or pale green leaves, which are often broader and more rounded than those of the typical sessilifolia. This plant is typically found in moist, temperate environments, such as stream banks and wetlands. Its growth habit is generally shrub-like, with multiple stems arising from the base. The flowers are catkins, which are typical of willow species, and they appear in early spring."
