    "intro": "Selaginella victoriae, commonly known as the Richmondiana clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It has a distinctive appearance with slender, branching stems and tiny, scale-like leaves that give it a mossy appearance. The plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds, a characteristic typical of its evolutionary group, the lycophytes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat."
