    "intro": "Smilax aculeata, commonly known as the catbrier, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are covered in sharp, stiff spines. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in groups of three. These flowers are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife but toxic to humans. Smilax aculeata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks."
