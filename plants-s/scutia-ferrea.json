    "intro": "Scutia ferrea, commonly known as ironwood or ironwood tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and sturdy, woody stems that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain seeds. Scutia ferrea is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates. Its hardy nature and ornamental qualities make it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with hot, dry conditions."
