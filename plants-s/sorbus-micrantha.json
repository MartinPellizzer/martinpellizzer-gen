    "intro": "Sorbus micrantha, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, red-orange berries in the fall. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. Sorbus micrantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, providing food for birds and insects."
