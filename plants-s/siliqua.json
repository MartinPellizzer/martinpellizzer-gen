    "intro": "Siliqua, commonly known as the wild mustard, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, yellow flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits called siliques, which contain several seeds. Siliqua is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been naturalized in many regions around the world. It plays an important role in both ecological systems and agricultural contexts."
