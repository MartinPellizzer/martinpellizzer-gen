It features upright, branched stems that bear opposite, ovate to obovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
