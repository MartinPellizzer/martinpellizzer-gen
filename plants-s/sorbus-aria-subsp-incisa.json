    "intro": "Sorbus aria subsp. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, serrated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical Sorbus aria. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by clusters of small, red berries in the autumn. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting various wildlife species."
