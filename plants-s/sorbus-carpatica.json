    "intro": "Sorbus carpatica, commonly known as the Carpathian rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to central and eastern Europe. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 meters and is characterized by its dense, thornless branches. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that are a food source for birds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have finely serrated edges, contributing to its ornamental value. Sorbus carpatica thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks."
