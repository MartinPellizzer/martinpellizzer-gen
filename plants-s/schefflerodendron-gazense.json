It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red or orange berries. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor cultivation and botanical gardens."
