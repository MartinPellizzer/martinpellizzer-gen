    "intro": "Statice tournefortii, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in coastal areas and well-drained soils, often growing in sandy or gravelly habitats. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Statice tournefortii is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms and ornamental value."
