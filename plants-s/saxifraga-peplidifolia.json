    "intro": "Saxifraga peplidifolia, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It typically grows in rocky and alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals and numerous stamens, and bloom in late summer. Saxifraga peplidifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous soils."
