    "intro": "Soehrensia sandiensis, commonly known as the sand forest tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, glossy green leaves and produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salt exposure. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh conditions. Soehrensia sandiensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
