    "intro": "Strobus monticola, commonly known as the mountain clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit with dense clusters of needle-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a rare species in many areas."
