    "intro": "Sambucus bipinnata, commonly known as the red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are twice-pinnate, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible when fully ripe but contain toxic compounds when unripe. Sambucus bipinnata is often found in moist woodlands and thrives in partial to full shade."
