    "intro": "Salsola grandiflora, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in desert environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by spiny, bead-like fruits. Its leaves are usually small, fleshy, and succulent, adapted to conserve water. Salsola grandiflora plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
