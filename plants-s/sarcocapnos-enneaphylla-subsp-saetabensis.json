The plant features a low-growing rosette of basal leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of white hairs, providing protection against harsh weather conditions. Its flowering stems bear small, clustered flowers with five petals, often displaying shades of pink or white. This subspecies is notable for its resilience and adaptability to high-altitude ecosystems."
