    "intro": "Schiedeella congestiflora, commonly known as the clustered schiedea, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with woody stems and elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories on the island of Maui. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
