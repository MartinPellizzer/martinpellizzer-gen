It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads.

Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in moist, shaded habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
