    "intro": "Scandix procumbens, commonly known as creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America. It typically forms dense mats of foliage close to the ground, with small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological systems in its native habitat."
