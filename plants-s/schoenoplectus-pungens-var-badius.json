    "intro": "Schoenoplectus pungens var. badius, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features tall, slender stems that often reach heights of up to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
