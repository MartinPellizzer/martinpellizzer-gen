    "intro": "Sedum fui var. longisepalum, commonly known as the long-sepal sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that help it store water. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically in summer. Its long, narrow sepals give it its specific name, and it thrives in full sun with minimal water. It is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
