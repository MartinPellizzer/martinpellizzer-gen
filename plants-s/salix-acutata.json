    "intro": "Salix acutata, commonly known as the sharp-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are sharply pointed and often have a reddish or brownish hue on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, wetlands, and other water sources. Salix acutata plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
