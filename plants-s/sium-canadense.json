    "intro": "Sium canadense, commonly known as Canadian waterparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-like flower clusters. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant features slender, hollow stems and leaves that are deeply lobed, often with a fern-like appearance. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbrella-shaped inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as flies and bees. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
