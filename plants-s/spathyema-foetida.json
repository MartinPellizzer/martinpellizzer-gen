    "intro": "Spathyema foetida, commonly known as the stinking begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that are often a deep green or reddish-brown in color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the warmer months. Its most notable feature is its strong, unpleasant odor, which is believed to deter herbivores. Spathyema foetida thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique foliage."
