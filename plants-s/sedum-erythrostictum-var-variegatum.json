    "intro": "Sedum erythrostictum var. variegatum, commonly known as the Variegated Stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the eastern United States. It features fleshy, upright stems that are often tinged with red or purple, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red during the summer months. Its leaves are typically variegated, with white or yellow markings that add to its ornamental value. It is well-suited for rock gardens, containers, or as a ground cover due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
