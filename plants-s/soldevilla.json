    "intro": "Soldevilla, commonly known as the mountain laurel, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the genus Kalmia, which is part of the Ericaceae family, also known as the heath family. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. Soldevilla thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
