It is characterized by its distinctive samaras, which are winged seeds that aid in wind dispersal. The tree has palmate leaves that split into five to seven lobes, resembling a maple leaf. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age. Samara frondosa typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
