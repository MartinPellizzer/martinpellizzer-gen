    "intro": "Sonchus acidus, commonly known as sour weed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves with a sour taste due to the presence of sesquiterpene lactones. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of climates. Its botanical features make it both a weed and a plant of interest in ecological and medicinal studies."
