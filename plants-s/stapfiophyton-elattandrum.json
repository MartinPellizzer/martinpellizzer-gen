It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
