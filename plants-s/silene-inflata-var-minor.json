    "intro": "Silene inflata var. minor, commonly known as the lesser balloonflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, inflated flower buds that resemble small balloons, typically pink to purple in color. The plant grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that open as the buds mature. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to drought conditions."
