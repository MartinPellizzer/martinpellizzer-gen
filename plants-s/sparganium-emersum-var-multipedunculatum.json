    "intro": "Sparganium emersum var. multipedunculatum, commonly known as the fragrant bur reed, is a wetland plant characterized by its tall, upright stems that often reach heights of up to 2 meters. It produces dense, cylindrical clusters of small, yellowish flowers that are borne on multiple peduncles, giving it its specific epithet \"multipedunculatum.\" The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soils, typically in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often floating on the water surface, while its rhizomes help stabilize the soil. This variety is notable for its aromatic foliage and its role in providing habitat for aquatic insects and birds."
