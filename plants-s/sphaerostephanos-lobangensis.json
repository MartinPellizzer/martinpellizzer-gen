    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos lobangensis, commonly known as the Philippine star orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its tropical habitat. Its flowers are often fragrant and attract various pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
