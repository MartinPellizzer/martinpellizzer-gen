    "intro": "Sparganium minimum subvar. rostratum, commonly known as the narrowleaf bur-reed, is a wetland plant characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, spiky inflorescences. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikelets, which are often submerged or just at the water's surface. Its leaves are narrow and cylindrical, with a distinctive, slightly recurved tip. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize shoreline soils and provide habitat for aquatic life."
