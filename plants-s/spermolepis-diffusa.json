    "intro": "Spermolepis diffusa, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a pappus, aiding in its propagation across sandy and coastal environments. Spermolepis diffusa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important component of coastal flora, contributing to soil stabilization and biodiversity."
