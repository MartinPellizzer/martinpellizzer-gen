    "intro": "Sarracenia \u00d7 dormeriana, commonly known as the hybrid pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a hybrid between Sarracenia leucophylla and Sarracenia rubra, resulting in a plant with distinctive, tubular, red-tinged pitchers that secrete digestive enzymes. The plant thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its pitchers are designed to trap and digest insects, providing essential nutrients in nutrient-poor environments. This hybrid is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique ecological adaptations."
