    "intro": "Saxifraga macrostigmatoides var. habaensis, commonly known as the Haba saxifrage, is a rare alpine plant native to the high-altitude regions of China. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit with fleshy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
