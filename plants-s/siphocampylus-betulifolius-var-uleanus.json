    "intro": "Siphocampylus betulifolius var. uleanus, commonly known as the Ulean willow-leaf gentian, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, willow-like leaves and striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Its flowers are tubular and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is considered rare and is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
