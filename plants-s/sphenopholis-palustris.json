It belongs to the family Sphenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in areas with low light conditions. Its structure consists of a creeping rhizome with spirally arranged, linear leaves. Sphenopholis palustris plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
