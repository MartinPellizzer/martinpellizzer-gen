    "intro": "Serratula indivisa, commonly known as the common sowthistle, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of smooth, spoon-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Native to Europe, it has been introduced to other regions and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant is an annual or biennial herb that can grow up to 30 cm tall. Its leaves and flowers are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though it is generally considered a weed."
