    "intro": "Scleropoa rigida var. robusta, commonly known as the robust rigid grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its rigid, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This variety thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. Due to its hardy nature, Scleropoa rigida var. robusta is an important component of high-altitude ecosystems and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
