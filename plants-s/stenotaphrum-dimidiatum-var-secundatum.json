    "intro": "Stenotaphrum dimidiatum var. secundatum, commonly known as Florida grass or St. Augustine grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its coarse, dark green blades and a dense, sod-forming growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is widely used in lawns and landscapes due to its tolerance of heat and humidity. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth allows it to spread and form a thick turf."
