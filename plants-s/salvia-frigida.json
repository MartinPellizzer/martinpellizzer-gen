    "intro": "Salvia frigida, commonly known as blue sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple floral spikes that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Salvia frigida is also valued for its aromatic properties and is often used in traditional medicine."
