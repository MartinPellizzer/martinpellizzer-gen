    "intro": "Silene mekinensis, commonly known as the Mekin's catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its showy, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Silene mekinensis is notable for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators and its resilience to extreme climatic conditions."
