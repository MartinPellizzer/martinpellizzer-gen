    "intro": "Solidago dahurica, commonly known as the Siberian goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern Asia. It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in the late summer and early autumn. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along riverbanks. Solidago dahurica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators during the late growing season."
