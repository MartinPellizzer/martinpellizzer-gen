    "intro": "Staavia dodii, commonly known as the Natal grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often found in the region of KwaZulu-Natal. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale green to brown in color. It is well adapted to coastal environments and can tolerate salt spray and sandy conditions. Staavia dodii is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
