    "intro": "Silene mekinensis subvar. micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and delicate, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its flowers are usually less than 1 centimeter in diameter, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
