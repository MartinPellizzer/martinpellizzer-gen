    "intro": "Sapium giganteum, commonly known as the giant soapberry tree, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces smooth, green fruits that turn red when mature, containing seeds enclosed in a fleshy, berry-like pulp. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. The tree is notable for its ability to tolerate urban environments and is sometimes used in ornamental landscaping."
