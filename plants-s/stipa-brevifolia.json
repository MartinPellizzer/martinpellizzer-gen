    "intro": "Stipa brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and sandy soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and short, often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Stipa brevifolia is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
