    "intro": "Sporobolus neglectus var. ozarkanus, commonly known as Arkansas sandreed, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and prairies. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions, making it drought-tolerant. Its botanical features make it an important species for stabilizing soils and supporting local wildlife."
