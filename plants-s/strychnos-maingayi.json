    "intro": "Strychnos maingayi, commonly known as the African strychnos, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are a source of the alkaloids strychnine and brucine. It is often found in dry, open woodland and is used in traditional medicine, though its toxic properties make it highly dangerous."
