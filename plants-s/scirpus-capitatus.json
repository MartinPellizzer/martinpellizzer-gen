    "intro": "Scirpus capitatus, commonly known as the purple bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces dense, spike-like clusters of purple flowers at the top of its stems, which are typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its rhizomes are often used in phytoremediation due to their ability to absorb heavy metals from contaminated soils. Scirpus capitatus thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important species for wetland ecosystems."
