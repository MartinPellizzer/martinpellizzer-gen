    "intro": "Scutellaria fruticetorum, commonly known as the creeping blueweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Scutellaria fruticetorum is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties."
