    "intro": "Stapelia rosea, commonly known as the sweet scent stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive, fragrant scent. These flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, often in clusters along the stems. Stapelia rosea is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
