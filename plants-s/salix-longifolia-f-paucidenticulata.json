    "intro": "Salix longifolia f. paucidenticulata, commonly known as the sparse-toothed willow, is a variant of the long-leaved willow characterized by its reduced number of leaf teeth. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, particularly China and the Himalayas. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or minimally serrated margin. It produces catkin-like inflorescences, typical of the Salicaceae family, which contain both male and female flowers. This form is often noted for its ornamental value and is cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
