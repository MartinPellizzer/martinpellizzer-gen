    "intro": "Saussurea conaensis, commonly known as the Yunnan saffron, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, yellowish-orange flower heads. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are clustered in a composite inflorescence, typical of the daisy family. Saussurea conaensis is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional Chinese medicine, where its roots are used to treat various ailments. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
