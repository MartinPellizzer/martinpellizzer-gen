    "intro": "Saxifraga deminuta, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a small flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in harsh environments where few other plants can survive. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the short growing season. Its leaves are usually succulent and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to retain moisture in arid conditions. Saxifraga deminuta is valued for its hardiness and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cold climates."
