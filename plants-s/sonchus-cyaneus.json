    "intro": "Sonchus cyaneus, commonly known as blueweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant features a basal rosette of blue-green leaves with hairy surfaces, and produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It has a taproot system and is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds. Due to its invasive nature, it can become a weed in agricultural areas and natural habitats."
