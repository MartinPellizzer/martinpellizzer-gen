    "intro": "Shibataea nanpingensis var. fujianica, commonly known as the Fujian stone pine, is a rare and endemic evergreen conifer native to southern China. It belongs to the family Pinaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and needle-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 800 to 1,500 meters. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
