    "intro": "Schlegelia macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf schlegelia, is a striking member of the Araliaceae family native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length, often with a glossy green surface and prominent veins. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, followed by bright red berries that are a key feature of its ornamental value. Schlegelia macrophylla thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-drained, fertile soil. Its unique foliage and seasonal flowering make it a popular choice for indoor and shaded garden settings."
