    "intro": "Syncolostemon, commonly known as the \"cotton bush,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that resemble cotton balls, which give the genus its common name. Syncolostemon species are typically shrubs or small trees, native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. They have alternate, simple leaves that are usually hairy or woolly to the touch. The flowers are usually borne in clusters and are pollinated by insects, contributing to their ecological importance in their native habitats."
