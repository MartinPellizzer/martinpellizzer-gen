It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, oval-shaped leaves and small, dark purple to black berries. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, and it produces toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though with caution."
