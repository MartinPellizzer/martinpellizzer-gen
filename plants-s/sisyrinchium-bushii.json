    "intro": "Sisyrinchium bushii, commonly known as the Sierra dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 5 to 15 centimeters. The plant features bright yellow flowers with ray florets, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, forming a dense mat that helps it thrive in rocky or sandy soils. Sisyrinchium bushii is adapted to arid environments and is often found in open woodland or along stream banks."
