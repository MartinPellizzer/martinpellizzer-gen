    "intro": "Salix glauca var. orestera, commonly known as the white willow or sand willow, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its root system is extensive and helps stabilize sandy soils, making it ecologically important in desert environments. It is also known for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
