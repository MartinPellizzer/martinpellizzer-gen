    "intro": "Spergella saxatilis, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort that thrives in moist, rocky environments. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its simple, leaf-like structures called thallus. The plant typically grows in crevices or on rock surfaces, where it can absorb moisture from the environment. Its morphology includes a closely branched stem with small, oval-shaped leaves. Spergella saxatilis is often found in temperate regions and is an indicator species for calcareous substrates."
