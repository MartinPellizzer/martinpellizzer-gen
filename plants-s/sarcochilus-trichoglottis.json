    "intro": "Sarcochilus trichoglottis, commonly known as the feather-leaf saxifrage, is a terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand. It features a distinctive rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces a single, erect stem that bears a few white or pale green flowers with yellow markings. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species."
