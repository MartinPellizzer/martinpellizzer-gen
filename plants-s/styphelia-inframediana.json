    "intro": "Styphelia inframediana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wintergreen, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in heathland and coastal scrub environments. Styphelia inframediana is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscaping."
