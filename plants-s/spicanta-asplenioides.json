    "intro": "Spicanta asplenioides, commonly known as the creeping shield fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It has a dense, mat-forming growth habit with narrow, dark green, leathery leaves that are typically less than 10 inches long. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ground cover in shady gardens."
