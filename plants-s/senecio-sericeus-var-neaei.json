It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
