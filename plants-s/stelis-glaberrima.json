    "intro": "Stelis glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous stelis, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a compact, often branched stem with dense, fleshy leaves that help store water. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from white to pink. Stelis glaberrima is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
