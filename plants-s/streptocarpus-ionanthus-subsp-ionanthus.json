It features fleshy, dark green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern and produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are typically borne on long, slender stems and are pollinated by various insects, including bees and butterflies. This species is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ease of care."
