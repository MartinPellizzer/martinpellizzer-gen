    "intro": "Saintlegeria, commonly known as the \"Cape Cod plant,\" is a rare and unique species native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy, well-drained soils and thrives in coastal dune environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Saintlegeria is considered a conservation concern."
