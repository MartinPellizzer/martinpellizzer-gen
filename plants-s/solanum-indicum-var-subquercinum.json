    "intro": "Solanum indicum var. subquercinum, commonly known as the Indian nightshade variant, is a perennial shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features elliptical to ovate leaves that are typically pubescent and have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into globose, orange-red berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments. Due to its toxic compounds, it is generally avoided for consumption but is of interest in botanical studies."
