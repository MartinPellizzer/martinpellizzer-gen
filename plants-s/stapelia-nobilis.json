    "intro": "Stapelia nobilis, commonly known as the carrion flower, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and its striking, waxy flowers that resemble decaying flesh. The plant produces large, star-shaped blooms in shades of yellow to orange, often with a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Stapelia nobilis is a popular choice for cacti and succulent enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
