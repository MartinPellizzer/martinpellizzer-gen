It features a rosette of lance-shaped, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its unique globular inflorescence, which gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Sanguisorba globularis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
