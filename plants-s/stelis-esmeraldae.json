    "intro": "Stelis esmeraldae, commonly known as the Emerald Lady Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated inflorescence that bears clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its foliage consists of narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Stelis esmeraldae thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
