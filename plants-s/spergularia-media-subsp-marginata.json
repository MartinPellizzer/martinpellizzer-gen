It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, pinkish flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves. The plant thrives in well-drained, saline soils and is often found in dune environments. It has a low-growing habit and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This subspecies is adapted to harsh coastal conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes through its extensive root system."
