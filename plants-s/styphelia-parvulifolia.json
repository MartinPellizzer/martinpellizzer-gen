    "intro": "Styphelia parvulifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved whorltongue, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems, giving it its common name. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathland and coastal dune environments. Styphelia parvulifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowering display."
