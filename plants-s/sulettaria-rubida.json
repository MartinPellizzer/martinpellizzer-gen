    "intro": "Sulettaria rubida, commonly known as the red-flowered bellwether, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking crimson petals and compact, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a short, woody stem and possesses small, lance-shaped leaves arranged in a spiral pattern. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sulettaria rubida is considered a vulnerable species."
