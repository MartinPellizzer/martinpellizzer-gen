    "intro": "Stipa villosa, commonly known as silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, soft, and hairy leaves that give it a silvery appearance. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale-green to golden florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Stipa villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
