It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in temperate climates. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Staehelina syriaca is considered a rare and endangered species."
