It is a deciduous plant that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in tundra environments. The plant has slender branches and small, oval leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It produces catkins as its reproductive structures, which are typical of willow species. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and can survive in areas with limited growing seasons."
