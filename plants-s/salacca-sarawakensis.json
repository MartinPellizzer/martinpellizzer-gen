    "intro": "Salacca sarawakensis, commonly known as the Sarawak cherimoya, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It belongs to the Musaceae family, which includes bananas and plantains. The plant produces large, ornamental leaves that can grow up to several meters in length, making it a striking addition to gardens. Its fruit, while not widely cultivated, is edible and has a creamy texture with a flavor reminiscent of cherimoya. Due to its unique appearance and limited cultivation, it is often grown as an ornamental plant rather than for its fruit."
