    "intro": "Saxifraga microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wool. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and as a garden plant."
