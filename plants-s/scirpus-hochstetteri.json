    "intro": "Scirpus hochstetteri, commonly known as Hochstetter's bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, appearing in late summer to early autumn. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help stabilize the soil, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems. Scirpus hochstetteri is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and provide habitat for various wildlife."
