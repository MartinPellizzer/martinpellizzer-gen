It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. Its flowering period attracts a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Salvia cacaliifolia is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
