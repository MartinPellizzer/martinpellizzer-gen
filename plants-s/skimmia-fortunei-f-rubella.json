    "intro": "Skimmia fortunei f. rubella, commonly known as the red-leafed skimmia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to China. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn a striking reddish hue in the autumn. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that persist through the winter. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its vibrant foliage and seasonal interest throughout the year."
