It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. The plant has a thalloid structure, characterized by a flat, leaf-like body that is covered in small, scale-like structures. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophores, are typically found on the upper surface of the thallus. Selliguea stewartii plays a role in ecological systems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms."
