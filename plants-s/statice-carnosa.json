    "intro": "Statice carnosa, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often growing in dunes and salt marshes. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and floral arrangements. Statice carnosa is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh maritime environments."
