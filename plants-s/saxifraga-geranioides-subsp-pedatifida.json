    "intro": "Saxifraga geranioides subsp. pedatifida, commonly known as the broad-leaved saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features upright stems that bear opposite, palmately lobed leaves, which are typically hairy and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
