    "intro": "Solanum anomalum, commonly known as the yellow nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 1 meter, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Solanum anomalum contains alkaloids and is part of the nightshade family, which includes both edible and toxic species. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided for consumption and is more commonly found in wild or cultivated settings for ornamental purposes."
