    "intro": "Saxifraga cespitosa var. sternbergii, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in colder climates."
