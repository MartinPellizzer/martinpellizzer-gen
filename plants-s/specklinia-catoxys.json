    "intro": "Specklinia catoxys, commonly known as the cat's eye fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that feature a distinctive, eye-like pattern on the underside. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, velvety layer of root hairs, which aid in water absorption. Specklinia catoxys is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant."
