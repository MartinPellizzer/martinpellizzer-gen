    "intro": "Scabiosa frutescens, commonly known as the honeycomb flower, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its distinctive, spherical flower heads composed of numerous small, pink or white petals. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of tiny, petal-like bracts that give it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Scabiosa frutescens is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
