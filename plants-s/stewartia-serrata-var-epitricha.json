    "intro": "Stewartia serrata var. epitricha, commonly known as the broad-leafed stewartia, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, serrated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red capsules that split to release seeds. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant form and seasonal interest."
