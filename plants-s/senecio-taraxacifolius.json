    "intro": "Senecio taraxacifolius, commonly known as the dandelion-leaved groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a rough, hairy texture, resembling those of a dandelion. It produces small yellow flowers that develop into fluffy white seed heads, typical of the genus Senecio. This species thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal and inland regions of its native range."
