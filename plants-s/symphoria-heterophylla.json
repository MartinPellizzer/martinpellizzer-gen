    "intro": "Symphoria heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf symphoria, is a unique flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, which can range from broad and ovate to narrow and linear depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Symphoria heterophylla is often found in woodland areas and is noted for its ecological importance in supporting local insect populations."
