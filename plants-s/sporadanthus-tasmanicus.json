It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and coastal environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
