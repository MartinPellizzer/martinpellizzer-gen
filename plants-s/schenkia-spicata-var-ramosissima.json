It is characterized by its branching stems and small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish flowers that are surrounded by spiny bracts. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. Due to its succulent nature, it is adapted to store water efficiently, making it resilient to drought conditions."
