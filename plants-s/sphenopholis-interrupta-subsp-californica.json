    "intro": "Sphenopholis interrupta subsp. californica, commonly known as the California sphenophyll, is a rare and distinctive member of the Lycopodiaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged leaves that form a dense, cushion-like structure. The plant exhibits a low-growing, mat-forming habit, with small, scale-like foliage that is often densely packed. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
