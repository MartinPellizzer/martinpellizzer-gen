It is characterized by its dense, spirally arranged flowers that form a slender, flowering stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as bogs and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, white to pale pink flowers. This variety is distinguished by its unique floral structure and is often found in association with sphagnum moss in its natural environment."
