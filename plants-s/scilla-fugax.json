    "intro": "Scilla fugax, commonly known as the transient scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It produces striking blue to violet flowers in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant's foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that appear after flowering. Scilla fugax thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight. Due to its short blooming period, it is often referred to as a \"fleeting\" beauty in botanical gardens."
