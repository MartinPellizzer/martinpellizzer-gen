    "intro": "Siphocampylus andinus var. elegantissimus, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often with a contrasting throat. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
