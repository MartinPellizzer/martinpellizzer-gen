    "intro": "Spiraea callosa, commonly known as the rough spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It features slender, arching stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a rough, sandpapery texture that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. This plant is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
