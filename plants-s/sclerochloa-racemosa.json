    "intro": "Sclerochloa racemosa, commonly known as the tufted beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form compact clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. Its leaves are narrow, tough, and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Sclerochloa racemosa is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert habitats."
