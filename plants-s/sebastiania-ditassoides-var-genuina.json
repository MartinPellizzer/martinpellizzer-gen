    "intro": "Sebastiania ditassoides var. genuina, commonly known as the white-seed sebastiania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the Caribbean islands, particularly the Lesser Antilles, and is characterized by its attractive, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by distinctive, ornamental, white, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal areas or near freshwater sources. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
