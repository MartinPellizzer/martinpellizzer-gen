    "intro": "Sphaerocoma aucheri, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Sphaerocoma aucheri is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
