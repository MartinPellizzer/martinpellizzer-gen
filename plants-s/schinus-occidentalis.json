    "intro": "Schinus occidentalis, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 7 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals, containing compounds such as hydrocyanic acid. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is sometimes considered a problematic weed."
