    "intro": "Solanum ierense, commonly known as the Ierense nightshade, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous annual, featuring hairy stems and alternate leaves. Its flowers are usually white or purple, and it produces small, toxic berries that are often mistaken for edible fruits. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption and is more valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
