    "intro": "Stultitia conjuncta, commonly known as the jointed folly plant, is a rare and peculiar species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring elongated, jointed stems that resemble the structure of a human skeleton. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern, contributing to its unusual appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Stultitia conjuncta is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
