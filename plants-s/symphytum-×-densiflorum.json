    "intro": "Symphytum \u00d7 densiflorum, commonly known as the denseflower comfrey, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Due to its vigorous growth, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed carefully."
