    "intro": "Stigmaphyllon emarginatum f. parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved stigmaphyllon, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves with a distinctive emarginate (notched) tip. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white or gray pubescence, giving it a silvery appearance. This species is adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas."
