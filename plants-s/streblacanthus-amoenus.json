    "intro": "Streblacanthus amoenus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with prominent stamens that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in a fluffy, cotton-like capsule, which aids in seed dispersal. Streblacanthus amoenus is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in some areas."
