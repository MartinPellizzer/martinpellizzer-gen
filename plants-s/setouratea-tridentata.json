    "intro": "Setouratea tridentata, commonly known as the three-toothed fern, is a species of fern native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into three distinct lobes, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Setouratea tridentata plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
