It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely hairy, grayish foliage. The plant features small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its leaves are basal, forming a dense rosette, and the stems are often covered in a fine, woolly texture. Stemonurus tomentellus thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
