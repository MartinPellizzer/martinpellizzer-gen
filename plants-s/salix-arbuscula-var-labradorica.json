    "intro": "Salix arbuscula var. labradorica, commonly known as Labrador willow, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, triangular leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers early in the spring. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and coastal habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various Arctic fauna."
