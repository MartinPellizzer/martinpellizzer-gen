    "intro": "Stenochlaena intermedia, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowroot, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes many aquatic and semi-aquatic plants. The plant features a rhizomatous root system and produces large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. Its flowers are small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. Stenochlaena intermedia is often found in wetlands and marshy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
