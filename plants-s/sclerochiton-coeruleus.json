It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers, which are typically borne on slender, branched stems. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are usually arranged oppositely along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known in horticulture."
