    "intro": "Sticherus flabellatus var. compactus, commonly known as the compact fan moss, is a terrestrial moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, closely arranged leaves that often form a cushion-like structure. The leaves are typically curved and have a distinct costa that extends nearly to the leaf tip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors and rock crevices, and is often found in temperate regions. This variety is notable for its resilience and ability to survive in nutrient-poor substrates."
