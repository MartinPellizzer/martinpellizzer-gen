    "intro": "Selaginella laxistrobila, commonly known as the slender-strobilus spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant features a rosette of spirally arranged leaves, with the lower leaves being shorter and the upper ones longer and more upright. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and contain spores, which are released for propagation. Selaginella laxistrobila is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its role in ecological succession in forest ecosystems."
