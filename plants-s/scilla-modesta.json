    "intro": "Scilla modesta, commonly known as the common scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Scilla modesta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
