    "intro": "Scirpus tenuispicatus, commonly known as narrow-spike bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often growing in dense stands. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating that helps repel water. Scirpus tenuispicatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
