    "intro": "Saxifraga subsessiliflora, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features compact, rosette-forming foliage with dark green, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy species adapted to harsh mountain environments. Due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
