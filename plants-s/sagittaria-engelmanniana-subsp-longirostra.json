    "intro": "Sagittaria engelmanniana subsp. longirostra, commonly known as the long-beak arrowhead, is a aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense mats on the water surface or submerged in the substrate. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, with three sepals and three petals. This subspecies is valued for its ability to provide habitat for aquatic life and its role in water filtration."
