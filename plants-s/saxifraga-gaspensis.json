    "intro": "Saxifraga gaspensis, commonly known as the Gasp\u00e9 saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the rocky coastlines of eastern Canada. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found growing in coastal cliffs and rocky outcrops. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy layer that helps retain moisture. Saxifraga gaspensis is an important component of coastal ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and biodiversity in its habitat."
