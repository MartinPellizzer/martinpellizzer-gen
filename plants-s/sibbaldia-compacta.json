    "intro": "Sibbaldia compacta, commonly known as the dwarf sibbaldia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, dark green leaves that are arranged in a compact rosette. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Sibbaldia compacta is often used in alpine gardens for its hardiness and ornamental value."
