    "intro": "Stylogyne surinamensis, commonly known as the Surinam water plant, is a floating aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It features elongated, ribbon-like leaves that remain just above the water surface, allowing it to receive ample sunlight for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Stylogyne surinamensis is adapted to still or slow-moving freshwater environments and plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Its rapid growth makes it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in non-native waters."
