    "intro": "Sphaerocephalus microcephalus, commonly known as the dwarf mooncup, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, rounded, cup-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
