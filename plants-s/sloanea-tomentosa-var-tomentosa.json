It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub characterized by its dense, woolly grayish-white foliage. The leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a soft, pubescent texture that gives the plant its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing smooth, dark brown seeds. This plant is often found in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
