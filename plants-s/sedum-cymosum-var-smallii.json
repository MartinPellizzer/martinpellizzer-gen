    "intro": "Sedum cymosum var. smallii, commonly known as the smallii stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal water once established, making it ideal for xeriscaping. The leaves are usually blue-green in color and often have a slightly waxy coating to reduce water loss."
