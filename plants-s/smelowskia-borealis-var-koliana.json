    "intro": "Smelowskia borealis var. koliana, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a rare alpine plant native to the high Arctic regions of northern Canada and Greenland. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme cold and strong winds. Its leaves are typically hairy and narrow, helping to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The species plays a minor but important role in the local ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators in its brief flowering season."
