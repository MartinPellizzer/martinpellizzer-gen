    "intro": "Styphelia androstoma, commonly known as the pink mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Ericaceae family. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and the Gulf Coast regions. The plant has small, evergreen leaves and produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. It relies on a symbiotic relationship with host trees, such as oaks and hickories, for nutrients. Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical studies."
