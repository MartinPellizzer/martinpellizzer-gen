    "intro": "Saxifraga hypostoma, commonly known as the snow saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it forms low, mat-like growths. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually broad, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern to conserve moisture. Saxifraga hypostoma is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous environments with limited soil."
