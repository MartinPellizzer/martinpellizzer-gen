    "intro": "Sorbus aria var. hazslinszkyana, commonly known as the Hungarian whitebeam, is a rare and botanically distinct variant of the common whitebeam. It is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow berries and its distinctive, often twisted, branching pattern. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils and cooler climates. Its leaves are usually elliptical with serrated edges and can vary in color from dark green to reddish in autumn. This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features."
