It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, which are attracted to its vibrant colors and nectar. Strobilanthes jennyae is also noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
