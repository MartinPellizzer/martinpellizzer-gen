    "intro": "Salix phylicifolia var. elliptica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in stream banks and forest edges, where it contributes to erosion control. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden planting in temperate climates."
