    "intro": "Saxifraga nelsoniana var. carlottae, commonly known as the Carlottae saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically features rosettes of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are adapted to rocky and alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer, often arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens. This variant is distinguished by its compact growth habit and unique leaf morphology compared to other saxifrage species."
