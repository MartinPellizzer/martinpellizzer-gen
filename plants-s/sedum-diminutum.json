    "intro": "Sedum diminutum, commonly known as dwarf sedum, is a low-growing succulent native to arid regions of North America. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in a tight rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact size and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
