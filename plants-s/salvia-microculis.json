    "intro": "Salvia microculis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and spikes of violet to blue-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid regions. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal practices, and it attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Salvia microculis is valued for its ornamental beauty and drought tolerance in landscaping."
