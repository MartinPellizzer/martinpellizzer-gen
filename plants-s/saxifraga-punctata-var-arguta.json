    "intro": "Saxifraga punctata var. arguta, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a red or purple tint at the base. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Saxifraga punctata var. arguta is often found in subalpine and alpine tundra habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
