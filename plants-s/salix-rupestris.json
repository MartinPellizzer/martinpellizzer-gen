    "intro": "Salix rupestris, commonly known as the rock willow, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are adapted for wind pollination. It is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often growing in harsh, dry environments. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
