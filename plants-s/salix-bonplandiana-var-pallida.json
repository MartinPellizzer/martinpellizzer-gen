    "intro": "Salix bonplandiana var. pallida, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender branches and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered with a fine white down. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a fibrous texture that peels in thin layers. This species is well adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones along rivers and streams."
