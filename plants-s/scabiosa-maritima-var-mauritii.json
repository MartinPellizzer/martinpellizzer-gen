It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has silvery-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
