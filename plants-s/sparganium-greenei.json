    "intro": "Sparganium greenei, commonly known as the Greene's bur-reed, is a species of aquatic plant native to the wetlands of North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that rise from a rhizomatous root system, often growing in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, spadix-like flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, surrounded by narrow, leaf-like bracts. Its fruit is a spiky, three-lobed bur that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by water or animals. Sparganium greenei plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
