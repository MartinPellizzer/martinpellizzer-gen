    "intro": "Stellera nitida, commonly known as the smooth starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It features a dense mat of thin, hairy stems that form a cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine, silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Stellera nitida is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments."
