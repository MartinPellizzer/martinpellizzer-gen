    "intro": "Sarcochilus acuminatissimus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sarcocarp, is a terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces striking, pale green to yellowish flowers with a distinctive, wrinkled lip. The plant typically grows in damp, shaded environments, such as forests or along stream banks. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is known for its fragrant, honey-scented nectar. Sarcochilus acuminatissimus is a rare and protected species, often found in specific microhabitats across the North Island of New Zealand."
