    "intro": "Stereochlaena annua, commonly known as the annual marsh fern, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that emerge from a creeping rhizome. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, adapting to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that release spores, a method of propagation typical of ferns. Stereochlaena annua plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
