    "intro": "Spiraea japonica subvar. alpina, commonly known as the alpine spiraea, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features wiry, arching stems that bear clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early summer. The leaves are typically oval, with a slightly serrated edge, and turn yellow in autumn. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plants."
