    "intro": "Salix argyrocarpa, commonly known as the silverleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish coating. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
