    "intro": "Sabina megalocarpa, commonly known as the giant juniper, is a coniferous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of small, scale-like leaves arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces blue to black berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and landscapes."
