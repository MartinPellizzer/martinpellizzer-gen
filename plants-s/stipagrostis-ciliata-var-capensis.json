    "intro": "Stipagrostis ciliata var. capensis, commonly known as Cape hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with fine, ciliate margins. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid regions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
