    "intro": "Senecio jacobaea var. aurinitens, commonly known as the golden ragwort, is a variant of the common ragwort, characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to Europe and parts of western Asia. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It features a robust root system and hairy stems, with lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a weed in some regions and requires careful handling."
