    "intro": "Solidago perlonga, commonly known as the slender goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Solidago perlonga is often found in moist soils along stream banks and in wet meadows."
