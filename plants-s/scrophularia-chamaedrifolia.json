    "intro": "Scrophularia chamaedrifolia, commonly known as creeping scrophularia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open woodland or scrub habitats. The plant features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and have a slightly hairy texture. The flowers are tubular, typically pink or purple, and bloom in late spring to early summer."
