    "intro": "Sedum suboppositum, commonly known as the low-growing stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with fleshy, opposite leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Sedum suboppositum is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in rocky or arid environments."
