    "intro": "Salix humilis f. tortifolia, commonly known as the twisted willow, is a unique form of the common willow. It is characterized by its twisted, contorted branches that give it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. This shrub is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture and a grayish-green underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, contributing to its ecological value in supporting pollinators."
