It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, oval-shaped leaves with three distinct teeth along the edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. Sclerolaena tridens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
