    "intro": "Sarcococca guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemala boxwood, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Central America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in the fall. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are typically red or black, providing food for birds and small mammals. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is often used as a ground cover or in rock gardens."
