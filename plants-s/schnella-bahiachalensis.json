It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant has delicate, feathery fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually across the forest floor. It is native to parts of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates."
