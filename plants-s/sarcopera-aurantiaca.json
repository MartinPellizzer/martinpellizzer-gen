    "intro": "Sarcopera aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting various pollinators. Its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Sarcopera aurantiaca is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
