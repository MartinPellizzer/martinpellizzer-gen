It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family, characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces spikes of tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Scrophularia foetida is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is most noticeable when the flowers are in full bloom."
