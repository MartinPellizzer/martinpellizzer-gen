    "intro": "Solanum schimperianum var. polyanthemum, commonly known as the polyanthemum nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or white. The plant produces berries that are toxic to humans and animals, containing alkaloids such as solanines. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in coastal regions. Its ornamental value is limited due to its toxic properties, but it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
