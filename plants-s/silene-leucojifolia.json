It is characterized by its slender stems and showy, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Silene leucojifolia is an annual or biennial species, depending on the climate, and is often found in temperate regions."
