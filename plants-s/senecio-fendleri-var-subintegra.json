    "intro": "Senecio fendleri var. subintegra, commonly known as the Desert Blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
