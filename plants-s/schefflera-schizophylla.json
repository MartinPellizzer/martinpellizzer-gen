    "intro": "Schefflera schizophylla, commonly known as the Split-leaf Schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like leaves that are compound, with multiple leaflets radiating from a central stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by round, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as a decorative indoor plant due to its attractive foliage. Schefflera schizophylla is also valued for its ability to tolerate low light conditions and its relatively slow growth rate."
