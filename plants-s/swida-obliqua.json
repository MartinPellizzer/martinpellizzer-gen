    "intro": "Swida obliqua, commonly known as the narrowleaf thornapple, is a flowering plant native to parts of Central and South America. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. Swida obliqua is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
