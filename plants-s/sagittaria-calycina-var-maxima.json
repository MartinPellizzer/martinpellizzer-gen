    "intro": "Sagittaria calycina var. maxima, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It features arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with long, narrow roots submerged in the substrate. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, typically in late summer. It thrives in shallow, still waters with nutrient-rich soil. Sagittaria calycina var. maxima is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
