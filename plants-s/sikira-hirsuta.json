It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a cluster of small flowers. The plant is distinguished by its hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting various pollinators. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is often studied for its role in local ecosystems."
