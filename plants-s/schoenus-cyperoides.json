    "intro": "Schoenus cyperoides, commonly known as the swamp sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as swamps and seasonally flooded areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. Schoenus cyperoides plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
