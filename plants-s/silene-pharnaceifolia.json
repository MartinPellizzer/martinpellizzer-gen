    "intro": "Silene pharnaceifolia, commonly known as the marsh campion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained to slightly waterlogged soils. The plant features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its showy, pink to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer, are arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stems. Silene pharnaceifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
