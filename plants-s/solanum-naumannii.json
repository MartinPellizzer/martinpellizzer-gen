    "intro": "Solanum naumannii, commonly known as the Naumann's nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate or elliptic in shape. Its flowers are typically white or purple, and it produces small, toxic berries that are yellow when ripe. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in cultivation and used primarily in scientific research."
