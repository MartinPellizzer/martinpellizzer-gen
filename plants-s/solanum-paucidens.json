    "intro": "Solanum paucidens, commonly known as the small-fruited nightshade, is a species native to parts of South America. It is a herbaceous plant that typically grows in dry, open habitats. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that ripens to a yellow or orange color. Like other members of the Solanaceae family, it contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful if ingested."
