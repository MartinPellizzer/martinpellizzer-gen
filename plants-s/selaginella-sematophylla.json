    "intro": "Selaginella sematophylla, commonly known as the starry spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a rosette of needle-like leaves that are often adorned with small, star-shaped structures called trichomes. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically borne on separate stems called strobila. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, adapted to conserve moisture in dry environments. Selaginella sematophylla is often found in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and rock crevices."
