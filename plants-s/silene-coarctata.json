    "intro": "Silene coarctata, commonly known as the narrowleaf catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Silene coarctata is an important species for pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
