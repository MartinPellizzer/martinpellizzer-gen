It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers with intricate patterns, which help in attracting specific pollinators. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, and it often grows in association with other epiphytic plants.
