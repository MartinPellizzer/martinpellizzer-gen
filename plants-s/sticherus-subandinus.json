    "intro": "Sticherus subandinus, commonly known as the Andean haircap moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and the presence of short, hair-like structures called rhizoids. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its leaves are elongated and often have a distinct midrib, which is a common feature in the Dicranaceae family. Sticherus subandinus plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats."
