    "intro": "Solanum dulcamara var. pubescens, commonly known as woody nightshade, is a perennial vine native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It features hairy, pubescent stems and heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are typically green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found along stream banks or in woodland areas. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
