    "intro": "Sorbus lanuginosa f. elliptica, commonly known as the woolly whitebeams, is a variant of the whitebeam tree characterized by its elliptical leaves and dense, woolly pubescence. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for ornamental purposes due to its attractive, textured appearance. The species is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils."
