    "intro": "Spiraea sorbifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are narrow, elliptical, and covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile choice for garden landscapes. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
