It is a small, evergreen fern ally that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with short, needle-like leaves and a low-growing, mat-forming habit. Its sporophyte stage produces spores on specialized structures called strobila, which are arranged in clusters along the stems. Selaginella brevipinna is known for its resilience and ability to survive in challenging conditions, making it a common sight in temperate and tropical regions."
