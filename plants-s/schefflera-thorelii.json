It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are deeply lobed and resemble a net, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as a ornamental plant. Schefflera thorelii is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
