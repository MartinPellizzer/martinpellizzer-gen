    "intro": "Sarracenia flava var. sanguinea, commonly known as the red-stemmed pitcher plant, is a variant of the yellow pitcher plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking red to orange-red stems and leaves that form deep, tubular pitchers. The plant's pitchers are covered in fine, downward-pointing hairs that aid in trapping insects. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is adapted to wet, acidic soils and thrives in boggy environments."
