It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, speckled leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in a raceme. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
