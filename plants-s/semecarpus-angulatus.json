    "intro": "Semecarpus angulatus, commonly known as the angle-fruit or Indian almond tree, is a deciduous tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, angular fruits. The tree produces a milky latex that is used in traditional medicine for its purported antifungal and antiseptic properties. Its seeds are enclosed in a hard, angular capsule, which gives the plant its common name. The plant is also valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated for its ecological benefits."
