    "intro": "Stipa jagnobica, commonly known as the Jagnobica needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-bearing flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in steppes and desert margins. Stipa jagnobica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat."
