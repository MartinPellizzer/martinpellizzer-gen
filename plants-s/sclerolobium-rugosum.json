    "intro": "Sclerolobium rugosum, commonly known as the rough-leaved acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody, branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are rough and hairy to the touch. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, brown seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. Sclerolobium rugosum is adapted to withstand drought and has a slow growth rate, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystem."
