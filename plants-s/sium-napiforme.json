    "intro": "Sium napiforme, commonly known as skunk cabbage, is a herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, mottled green and purple inflorescence that resembles a skunk's nose, hence its common name. The plant has a thick, fleshy rootstock that stores nutrients and aids in its survival through winter. Its flowers are unique in that they produce heat, helping to melt snow around them and attract early pollinators. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy surface that helps repel water."
