    "intro": "Saxifraga jurtzevii, commonly known as the Yurtzev saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and rosette-forming leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the stem tips. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
