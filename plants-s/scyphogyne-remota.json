    "intro": "Scyphogyne remota, commonly known as the remote scyphogyne, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae, which includes many ornamental and horticulturally significant species. The plant is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with contrasting veining. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Scyphogyne remota is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
