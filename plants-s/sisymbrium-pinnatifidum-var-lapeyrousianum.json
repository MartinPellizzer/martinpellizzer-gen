    "intro": "Sisymbrium pinnatifidum var. lapeyrousianum, commonly known as the Lapeyrouse's shepherd's purse, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive triangular or heart-shaped leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces elongated, ridged seed pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. This variety is native to southern Europe and is considered a herbaceous perennial."
