    "intro": "Senegalia croatii, commonly known as the Croatian acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria. The plant produces small, yellow, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds, and its leaves are often used for forage in livestock grazing. Senegalia croatii is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
