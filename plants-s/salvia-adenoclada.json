    "intro": "Salvia adenoclada, commonly known as the desert sage, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in whorls along the stems, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Salvia adenoclada is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
