    "intro": "Saxifraga crocea, commonly known as the yellow saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, basal leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically five-petaled and arranged in a loose inflorescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Saxifraga crocea is often found in mountainous areas and is a hardy plant that can withstand harsh environmental conditions."
