    "intro": "Stylocoryna dallachyana, commonly known as the Dallachyana lichen, is a unique lichen species that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its pale yellow to orange thallus, which is typically crustose in growth form, adhering tightly to the substrate. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in various environmental conditions. It is often found on bark, stone, or soil in temperate and subtropical regions. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and specialized organism."
