    "intro": "Senecio corrugatus, commonly known as the wrinkled groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It has narrow, gray-green leaves with a distinctive wrinkled texture, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Senecio corrugatus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
