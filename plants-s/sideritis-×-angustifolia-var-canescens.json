    "intro": "Sideritis \u00d7 angustifolia var. canescens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwort, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, grayish-white hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly serrated edge, and are arranged alternately along the stem. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
