    "intro": "Scleria killipiana, commonly known as the Killip's bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly referred to as the sedge family. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. Its slender, grass-like stems are often topped with small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Scleria killipiana plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
