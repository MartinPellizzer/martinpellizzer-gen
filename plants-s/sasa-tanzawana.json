It is characterized by its robust, slender culms that grow in dense clumps, forming thickets in moist, mountainous habitats. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Sasa tanzawana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.
