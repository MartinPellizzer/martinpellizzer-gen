It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
