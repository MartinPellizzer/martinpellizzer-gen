    "intro": "Silene littorea subsp. adscendens, commonly known as the coastal campion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines. The plant produces showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its subspecies adscendens is distinguished by its ascending growth habit and slightly larger flowers compared to the typical form. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
