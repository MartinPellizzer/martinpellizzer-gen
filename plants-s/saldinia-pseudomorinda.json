    "intro": "Saldinia pseudomorinda, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and woody, aromatic bark. The plant is known for its slow growth and can live for several decades, making it a valuable resource in traditional medicine. Its leaves are often used in herbal remedies, while the wood is prized for its durability and aesthetic appeal. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in many areas."
