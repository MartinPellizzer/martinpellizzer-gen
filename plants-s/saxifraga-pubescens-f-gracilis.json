It features small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in mountainous regions. Its compact form and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
