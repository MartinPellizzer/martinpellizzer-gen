    "intro": "Stellaria pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf starwort, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, featuring delicate, star-shaped white flowers that bloom from June to August. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides. Stellaria pusilla is characterized by its low-growing habit and its ability to spread through seed production."
