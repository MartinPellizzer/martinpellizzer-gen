    "intro": "Sida rhombifolia var. insularis, commonly known as the Island Mallows, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It is characterized by its broad, rhombic-shaped leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is an annual or short-lived perennial, often found in coastal and sandy habitats. Its hairy stems and leaves help it retain moisture in arid environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
