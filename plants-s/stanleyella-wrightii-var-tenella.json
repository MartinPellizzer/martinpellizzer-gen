    "intro": "Stanleyella wrightii var. tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Stanleyella, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and has a compact growth habit. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually appearing in early spring, and it is known for its medicinal properties in traditional use. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
