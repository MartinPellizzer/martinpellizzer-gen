    "intro": "Stylopappus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf stylopappus, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has small, narrow leaves and produces tiny, yellowish flowers clustered in dense, spherical heads. It is often found in open grasslands and is relatively uncommon in the wild. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and delicate species."
