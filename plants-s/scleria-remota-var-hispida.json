    "intro": "Scleria remota var. hispida, commonly known as the rough-stemmed sedges, is a perennial herb native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish or brownish flowers in spikelets. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats such as marshes and swamps. Its stems are often covered in short, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
