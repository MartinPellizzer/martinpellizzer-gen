    "intro": "Schomburgkia superbiens, commonly known as the giant spider orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble spiders, with long, slender petals and a distinctive, elongated lip. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial herb, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, and features a robust rhizome system. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a dramatic display to the understorey of its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species and is often protected in conservation areas."
