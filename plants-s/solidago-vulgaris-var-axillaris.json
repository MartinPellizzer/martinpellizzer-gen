    "intro": "Solidago vulgaris var. axillaris, commonly known as the axillary goldenrod, is a variant of the common goldenrod native to North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and stream banks. The plant features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in the late summer and early autumn. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have hairy surfaces. This variant is notable for its distinct flowering pattern, with some inflorescences occurring in the leaf axils, giving it its specific name."
