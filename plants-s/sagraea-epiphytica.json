    "intro": "Sagraea epiphytica, commonly known as the epiphytic sagraea, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions in South America. It is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants, typically in humid and shaded environments. The plant has small, clustered leaves that are adapted to capture moisture from the air. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Sagraea epiphytica is considered a delicate and endangered species."
