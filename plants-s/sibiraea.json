    "intro": "Sibiraea, commonly known as the genus of flowering plants in the family Rosaceae, consists of several species native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, white or pink flowers. Sibiraea species are often found in forested areas and are adapted to a variety of soil types. They produce small, aggregate fruits called pomes, similar to apples, and are valued for their ornamental and ecological benefits. Some species are also used in traditional medicine and horticulture."
