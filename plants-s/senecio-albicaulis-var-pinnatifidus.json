    "intro": "Senecio albicaulis var. pinnatifidus, commonly known as the white-stemmed groundsel, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a hairy stem and produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray florets. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. This variety is notable for its unique leaf structure, which is deeply lobed and pinnatifid, giving it a distinctive appearance."
