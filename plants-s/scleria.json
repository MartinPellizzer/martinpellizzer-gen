    "intro": "Scleria, commonly known as water plantain, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae. These plants are typically found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. They have grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and their flowers are small and clustered in spikelets. Scleria species are characterized by their rhizomatous growth and ability to thrive in moist or aquatic environments. They play an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
