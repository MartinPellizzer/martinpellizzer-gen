    "intro": "Sarothamnus dieckii, commonly known as the Desert Tanbark, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, featuring small, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions, and its leaves contain compounds that have been used traditionally by indigenous peoples. Sarothamnus dieckii is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for desert wildlife."
