    "intro": "Salix obtuaiserrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a species of flowering plant in the genus Salix. It is native to parts of Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in moist, temperate environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that have a serrated edge, giving it its scientific name. It produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it is often found along riverbanks and wetlands. The narrow-leaf willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
