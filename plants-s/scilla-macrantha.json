    "intro": "Scilla macrantha, commonly known as the giant squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features strap-like, grassy leaves and produces clusters of large, showy blue or violet flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or woodland habitats. Its bulbs are edible when young and were historically used in Mediterranean cuisine. Scilla macrantha is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and early blooming habit."
