    "intro": "Schoenus rigens, commonly known as the rigid sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often green or reddish in color. Schoenus rigens is characterized by its erect growth habit and is often found in dense stands. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
