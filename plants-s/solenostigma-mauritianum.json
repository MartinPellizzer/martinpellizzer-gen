    "intro": "Solenostigma mauritianum, commonly known as the Mauritius star-leaf, is a rare endemic plant native to the island of Mauritius. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing nectar that attracts various pollinators. Due to habitat loss, Solenostigma mauritianum is considered vulnerable and is protected in its native range."
