    "intro": "Salix dailingensis, commonly known as the Dailing willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender branches and small, oval leaves. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
