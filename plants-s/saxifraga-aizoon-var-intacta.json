    "intro": "Saxifraga aizoon var. intacta, commonly known as the Sierra Valley saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically thrives in rocky, alpine environments, where it forms dense mats of foliage. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of stems, and bloom in early summer. This variety is known for its resilience and ability to colonize disturbed or barren soils in mountainous regions."
