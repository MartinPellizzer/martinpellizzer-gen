    "intro": "Salix populifolia, commonly known as the poplar-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a tendency to peel in thin, flaky layers. Salix populifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers, wetlands, and other water bodies."
