    "intro": "Stelis calopsix, commonly known as the pink-stemmed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a compact, upright growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive spurred lip that aids in pollination. Stelis calopsix thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
