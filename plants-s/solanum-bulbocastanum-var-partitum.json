    "intro": "Solanum bulbocastanum var. partitum, commonly known as the spotted nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dark green, lobed leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces violet berries that ripen to a deep red, containing toxic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal areas. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care."
