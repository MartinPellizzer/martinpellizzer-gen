    "intro": "Solanum sanguineum, commonly known as the bloodberry plant, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its small, red berries that resemble blood, hence its common name. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is known for its ornamental value. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a rough texture, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The berries are edible when ripe but can be toxic if consumed unripe."
