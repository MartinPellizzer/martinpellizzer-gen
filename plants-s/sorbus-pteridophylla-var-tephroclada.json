    "intro": "Sorbus pteridophylla var. tephroclada, commonly known as the alpine whitebeam, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
