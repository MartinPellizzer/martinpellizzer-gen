    "intro": "Salix jahandiezii, commonly known as the Afghan willow, is a species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
