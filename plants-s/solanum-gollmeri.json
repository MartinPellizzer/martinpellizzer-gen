    "intro": "Solanum gollmeri, commonly known as the Gollmer's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or violet. The plant produces small, round berries that are generally green when unripe and turn red when mature. Solanum gollmeri is often found in high-altitude regions and thrives in cool, moist environments. It is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
