    "intro": "Sida humilis var. veronicifolia, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. It has a fibrous root system and produces capsules that contain numerous small seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in many regions."
