    "intro": "Sedum stenopetalum subsp. radiatum, commonly known as the radiate stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular ornamental plant in dry climates."
