    "intro": "Sisyrinchium clarazii, commonly known as the Clarazii blue-eyed grass, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It produces small, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
