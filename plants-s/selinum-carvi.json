    "intro": "Selinum carvi, commonly known as caraway, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and Western Asia. It features a slender, branched stem and narrow, aromatic leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, which are followed by spherical, dry fruits called mericarps. These fruits contain tiny, oil-rich seeds that have a distinct, pungent aroma. Caraway is known for its essential oils, which are extracted from the dried seeds and used in various industries, including food, fragrance, and traditional medicine."
