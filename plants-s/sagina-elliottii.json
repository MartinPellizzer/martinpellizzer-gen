    "intro": "Sagina elliottii, commonly known as Elliott's sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tiny, clustered flowers that bloom in spring and are typically white or pale pink. The plant has small, fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. Sagina elliottii is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
