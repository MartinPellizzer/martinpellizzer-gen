    "intro": "Sparganophorus ethulia, commonly known as the moonlight orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, pale lavender petals that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture from the thin, cold air. Its flowers bloom only during the lunar cycle, typically under full moon conditions. Due to its elusive nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is the subject of ongoing botanical research."
