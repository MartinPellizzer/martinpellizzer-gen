    "intro": "Stelis pilosissima, commonly known as the hairy stelis, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant features fleshy, dark green leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. Its roots are often covered in a dense, hairy coating, which gives it its common name. Stelis pilosissima is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
