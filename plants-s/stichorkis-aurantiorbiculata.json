    "intro": "Stichorkis aurantiorbiculata, commonly known as the golden orb cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a low-growing shrub with thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are reduced to spines, a characteristic adaptation to minimize water loss. The plant's unique morphology and ability to thrive in extreme conditions make it a notable example of desert flora."
