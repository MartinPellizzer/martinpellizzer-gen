    "intro": "Stilpnopappus villosus, commonly known as the hairy pappus grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its hairy, bristly structures on its inflorescence, which aid in wind dispersal of its seeds. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Stilpnopappus villosus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
