    "intro": "Salix massalskyi, commonly known as the Massalskyi willow, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and a silvery underside. Its catkin-like flowers appear in early spring, contributing to its role in pollination and seed dispersal. Salix massalskyi is valued for its hardiness and is often used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid environments."
