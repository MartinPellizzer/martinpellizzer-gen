    "intro": "Syringodea pulvinitormis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, translucent greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a short, fibrous root system and lacks leaves, relying instead on its stems for photosynthesis. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
