    "intro": "Scirpus thouarsianus var. virens, commonly known as the green bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that form dense clumps, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes, which are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in marshy or waterlogged soils and is often found in swampy areas near rivers or in coastal regions. Its fibrous roots make it an important species for stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic life."
