    "intro": "Saussurea komaroviana, commonly known as the Himalayan snow lotus, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, showy yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 3,000 to 5,000 meters. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The species is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional Tibetan and Ayurvedic medicine."
