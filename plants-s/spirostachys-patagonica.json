    "intro": "Spirostachys patagonica, commonly known as the Patagonian spirea, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and showy clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are small, elliptical, and covered with a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
