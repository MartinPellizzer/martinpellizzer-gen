    "intro": "Selaginella rupestris f. amurensis, commonly known as the Amur spikemoss, is a rare and unique fern ally native to the Far East. It is characterized by its diminutive, needle-like leaves that form dense, moss-like mats on rocky substrates. The plant exhibits a distinctive spore-producing structure called a strobilus, which is typically found at the tips of its stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
