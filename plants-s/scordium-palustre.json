    "intro": "Scordium palustre, commonly known as the marsh scordium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers in late spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in its habitat. Scordium palustre plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
