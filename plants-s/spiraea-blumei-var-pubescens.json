It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and profuse display of small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a hairy texture that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The plant is also valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
