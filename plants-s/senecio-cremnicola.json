It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in a cluster that resembles a snowdrop, giving it its common name. Senecio cremnicola is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
