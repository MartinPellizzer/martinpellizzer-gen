    "intro": "Selinum densiflorum, commonly known as the desert parsley, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value. The plant also has a long history of use in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples."
