    "intro": "Solidago virgaurea proles cambrica, commonly known as the creeping goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in the late summer and early autumn. The leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
