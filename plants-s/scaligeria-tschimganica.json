    "intro": "Scaligeria tschimganica, commonly known as the Tschimganica scalerie, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments. It is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Scaligeria tschimganica is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
