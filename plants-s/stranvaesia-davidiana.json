    "intro": "Stranvaesia davidiana, commonly known as the David's stranvaesia, is a rare and striking member of the Acanthaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa, particularly in South Africa and Lesotho. The plant is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of vibrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
