It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged opposite each other on the stems. The plant produces white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by large, round berries that are edible for certain bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. The subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
