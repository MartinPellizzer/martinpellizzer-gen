    "intro": "Stackhousia maidenii, commonly known as the Sydney flame or the pink flame, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often found in heathlands and open forests. The plant produces striking red or pink flowers during the spring and summer seasons, which attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a leathery texture that helps it conserve water in its natural habitat. Stackhousia maidenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
