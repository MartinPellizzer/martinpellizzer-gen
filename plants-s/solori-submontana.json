    "intro": "Solori submontana, commonly known as the mountain solori, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Solori submontana produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
