    "intro": "Spiraea henryi f. notabilis, commonly known as the Henry's spirea, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to China. It features upright, arching stems covered in dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The foliage is typically bright green, with a slight reddish tinge in autumn. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its neat growth habit and extended flowering period. This variety is more compact than the species, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces."
