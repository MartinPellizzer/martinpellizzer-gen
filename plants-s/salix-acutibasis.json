    "intro": "Salix acutibasis, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its male and female flowers, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks or in forested areas. Salix acutibasis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian zones. It is also used in traditional medicine in some regions for its purported therapeutic properties."
