It is characterized by its unique cactus body and a striking, showy flower that blooms at night. The plant has a short, thick stem covered in spines and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Its nocturnal blooming habit makes it a fascinating subject for both botanists and gardeners alike."
