    "intro": "Spathanthus jenmanii, commonly known as the Peruvian torch cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the Andean regions of Peru. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach several meters in height, often adorned with bright red flowers that bloom in clusters at the apex. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in rocky, well-drained soils with minimal rainfall. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Spathanthus jenmanii is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection."
