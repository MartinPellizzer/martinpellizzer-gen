It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green, with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces delicate, tubular flowers in shades of pink or red, which bloom in spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its compact size and ornamental appeal in both indoor and outdoor settings."
