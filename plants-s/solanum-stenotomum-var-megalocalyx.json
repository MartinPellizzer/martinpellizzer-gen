    "intro": "Solanum stenotomum var. megalocalyx, commonly known as the large-leaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often pubescent and its clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. The plant produces berries that start green and ripen to a deep red or purple, containing numerous seeds. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. Due to its toxic compounds, it is not typically cultivated for food but is studied for its potential medicinal properties."
