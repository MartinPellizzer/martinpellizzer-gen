It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by livestock and humans."
