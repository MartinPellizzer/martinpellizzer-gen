    "intro": "Stobaea adenocarpa var. incana, commonly known as the woolly leaf tree, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or gray pubescence covering the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and opposite, with a leathery texture. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. This plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping."
