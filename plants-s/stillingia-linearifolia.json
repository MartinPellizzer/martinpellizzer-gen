    "intro": "Stillingia linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stillingia, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its medicinal properties have been studied for their potential anti-cancer effects due to the presence of berberine and other alkaloids. However, it is considered a vulnerable species due to habitat loss and overharvesting."
