    "intro": "Stelis morenoi, commonly known as the Moreno's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is a small, epiphytic plant that grows on tree trunks and branches, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming during the wet season. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, and it thrives in high humidity and indirect light. Due to its restricted habitat, Stelis morenoi is considered a rare and endangered species."
