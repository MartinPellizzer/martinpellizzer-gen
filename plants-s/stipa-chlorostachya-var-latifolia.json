It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which are often tinged with a bluish hue. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and aesthetic qualities."
