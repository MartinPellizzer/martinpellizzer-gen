    "intro": "Scleria verticillata var. tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a rhizomatous root system and grows in dense, grass-like clumps with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, three-lobed flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in wet or seasonally wet environments, such as marshes and stream banks. Its botanical structure makes it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
