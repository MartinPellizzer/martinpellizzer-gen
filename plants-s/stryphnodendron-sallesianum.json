    "intro": "Stryphnodendron sallesianum, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
