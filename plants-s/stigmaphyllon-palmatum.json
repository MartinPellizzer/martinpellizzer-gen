    "intro": "Stigmaphyllon palmatum, commonly known as the Brazilian palm or the pink palm, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae. It is native to the Atlantic Forest of eastern Brazil, where it thrives in humid, tropical environments. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that are often tinged with pink or reddish hues. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fruits that are consumed by both humans and wildlife. Due to habitat loss, Stigmaphyllon palmatum is considered vulnerable and is a symbol of the biodiversity found in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest."
