    "intro": "Setaria clivalis, commonly known as the cliff grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought. Setaria clivalis is often found growing on rocky slopes and cliffs, contributing to soil stabilization in harsh environments."
