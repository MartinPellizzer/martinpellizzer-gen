    "intro": "Sericanthe testui, commonly known as the velvetleaf. It is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Sericanthe testui is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields due to its adaptability. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a common weed in many tropical environments."
