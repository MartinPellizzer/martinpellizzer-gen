    "intro": "Sartoria, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with prominent red stamens, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Sartoria is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a common weed in agricultural and disturbed areas."
