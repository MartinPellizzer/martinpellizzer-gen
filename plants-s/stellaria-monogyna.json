    "intro": "Stellaria monogyna, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom from spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and garden beds. Stellaria monogyna is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
