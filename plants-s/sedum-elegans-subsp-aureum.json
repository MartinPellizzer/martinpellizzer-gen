    "intro": "Sedum elegans subsp. aureum, commonly known as the golden sedum, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features fleshy, upright stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. This species is also valued for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
