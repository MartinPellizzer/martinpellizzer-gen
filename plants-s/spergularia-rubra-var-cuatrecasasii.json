    "intro": "Spergularia rubra var. cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas's sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, pink to red flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its thick, waxy leaf cuticle. This variety is considered a rare and specialized species within the genus Spergularia."
