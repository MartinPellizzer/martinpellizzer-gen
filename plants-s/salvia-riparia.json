    "intro": "Salvia riparia, commonly known as the riparian sage, is a perennial herb native to North America. It typically grows along rivers and streams, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features gray-green, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking violet-blue flowers in whorls along the stems. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. Salvia riparia is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
