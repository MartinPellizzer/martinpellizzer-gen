    "intro": "Solidago venulosa, commonly known as the slender goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a reddish or purplish hue along the midrib. Solidago venulosa plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies, during the late summer and early fall."
