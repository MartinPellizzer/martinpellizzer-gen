    "intro": "Solanum putii, commonly known as the Malayan nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom at night. The plant produces small, round berries that are edible but can be toxic if consumed in large quantities. Solanum putii is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in both horticulture and botany."
