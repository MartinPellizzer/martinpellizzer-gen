    "intro": "Styphelia procumbens, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a delicate touch to its foliage. The plant has leathery, dark green leaves that are arranged in a compact, mat-like form, allowing it to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Styphelia procumbens is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
