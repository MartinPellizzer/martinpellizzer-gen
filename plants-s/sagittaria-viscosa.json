    "intro": "Sagittaria viscosa, commonly known as swamp arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with some leaves extending above the water surface. The plant produces small, white, flower-like structures that are actually clusters of tiny flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomes are often coated in a sticky substance, which helps in anchoring the plant in muddy substrates. Sagittaria viscosa plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic insects and serving as a food source for waterfowl."
