    "intro": "Saussurea kaschgarica, commonly known as the Karakoram saussurea, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clustered, yellowish-green flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky areas, where it thrives in cold, arid conditions. Its fibrous roots help it anchor in loose, mountainous soils, while its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. Due to its habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
