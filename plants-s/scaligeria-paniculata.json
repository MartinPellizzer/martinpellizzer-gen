    "intro": "Scaligeria paniculata, commonly known as the swamp lily, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in the Americas. It features slender, erect stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in paniculate inflorescences. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in saturated soils, making it a common sight in marshes and along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats."
