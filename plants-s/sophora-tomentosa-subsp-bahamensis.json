    "intro": "Sophora tomentosa subsp. bahamensis, commonly known as the Bahamian senna, is a shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly the Bahamas. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and a profuse display of yellow flowers during the summer months. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in tropical ecosystems."
