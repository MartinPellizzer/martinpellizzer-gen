    "intro": "Specklinia prolixa, commonly known as the long-stalked speckled fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in small, rounded spore cases. Native to Southeast Asia, this fern thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new growth. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive, finely divided foliage."
