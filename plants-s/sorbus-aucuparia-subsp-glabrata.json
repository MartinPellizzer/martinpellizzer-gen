    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia subsp. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth rowan, is a subspecies of the rowan tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark, which distinguishes it from other rowan species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the autumn. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It typically grows in woodland edges, hillsides, and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils."
