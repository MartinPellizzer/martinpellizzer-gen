    "intro": "Schoenoplectus fluitans, commonly known as the floating bulrush, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often float on the water's surface, supported by air-filled tissues that provide buoyancy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in shallow water habitats. Schoenoplectus fluitans plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic life."
