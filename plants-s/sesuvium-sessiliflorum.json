    "intro": "Sesuvium sessiliflorum, commonly known as rock saltbush, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, succulent shrub that thrives in saline and sandy soils. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are fleshy and salt-tolerant, allowing it to survive in harsh, coastal environments. Sesuvium sessiliflorum plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in its native habitat."
