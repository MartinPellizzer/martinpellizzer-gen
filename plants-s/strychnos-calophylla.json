    "intro": "Strychnos calophylla, commonly known as the yellow-leafed strychnos, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often yellowish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by distinctive, woody fruits that contain toxic seeds. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties, though its use is limited due to the presence of toxic alkaloids. Strychnos calophylla is also appreciated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
