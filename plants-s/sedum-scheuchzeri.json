    "intro": "Sedum scheuchzeri, commonly known as the mountain stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, adapted to store water and survive in harsh, arid conditions. Sedum scheuchzeri is also noted for its resilience and ability to bloom reliably in cooler climates."
