    "intro": "Sabal coerulescens, commonly known as the blue needle palm, is a slow-growing, cold-hardy palm native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, dark green fronds that have a bluish tinge, giving it its common name. The plant typically reaches a height of 10 to 15 feet and has a narrow, upright growth habit. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers that develop into red, fleshy fruits. Sabal coerulescens is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
