    "intro": "Salvia melissiflora, commonly known as lemon beebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and clusters of showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is part of the mint family (Lamiaceae), which is known for its fragrant oils and medicinal properties. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal remedies, and the flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Salvia melissiflora thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant choice for xeriscaping."
