    "intro": "Scorzonera ammophila, commonly known as the sand couch or sand scorzonera, is a flowering plant native to sandy and coastal environments. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers with prominent, spurred petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in dunes or along coastal areas. Scorzonera ammophila is adapted to harsh, arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils through its extensive root system."
