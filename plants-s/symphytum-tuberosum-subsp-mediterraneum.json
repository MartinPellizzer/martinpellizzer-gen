    "intro": "Symphytum tuberosum subsp. mediterraneum, commonly known as the Mediterranean comfrey, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces tall spikes of violet or blue flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, capable of storing significant amounts of nutrients. This subspecies is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
