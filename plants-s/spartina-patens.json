    "intro": "Spartina patens, commonly known as salt meadow cordgrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of the United States. It thrives in brackish and saltwater environments, often found in marshes and tidal flats. The plant has slender, grass-like blades that are typically less than 1 meter in height. Its rhizomes form dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Spartina patens plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various wildlife species."
