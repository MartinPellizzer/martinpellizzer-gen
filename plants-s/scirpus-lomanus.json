    "intro": "Scirpus lomanus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets at the top of the stem, which are typically green or reddish in color. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help in stabilizing the soil in aquatic habitats. Scirpus lomanus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms."
