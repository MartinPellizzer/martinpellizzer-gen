    "intro": "Scorzoneroides duboisii, commonly known as the Dubois' scorzonera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grayish-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear small, yellowish flowers in a single, terminal raceme. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
