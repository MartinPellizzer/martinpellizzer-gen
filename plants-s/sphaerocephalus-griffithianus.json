    "intro": "Sphaerocephalus griffithianus, commonly known as the Himalayan snowball, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its spherical, white flower heads that resemble snowballs, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are actinomorphic, with numerous stamens surrounding a central pistil, and it is pollinated primarily by insects. Sphaerocephalus griffithianus is adapted to cold, alpine environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 2,000 meters."
