    "intro": "Spergularia media var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited sandspur, is a flowering plant native to sandy and coastal environments. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are distinctive, being large, inflated, and covered in hooked bristles that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to harsh, arid conditions."
