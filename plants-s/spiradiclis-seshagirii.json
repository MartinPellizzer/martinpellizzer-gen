    "intro": "Spiradiclis seshagirii, commonly known as the Seshagiri's spiral plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of southern India. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it a distinctive and visually striking appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming during the monsoon season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a humid, warm climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Spiradiclis seshagirii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
