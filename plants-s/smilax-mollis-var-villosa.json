    "intro": "Smilax mollis var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy smilax, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features a thick, woody stem covered in dense, persistent white or grayish hairs, which give it its common name. The plant has compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife."
