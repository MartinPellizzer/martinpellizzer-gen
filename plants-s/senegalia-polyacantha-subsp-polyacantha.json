    "intro": "Senegalia polyacantha subsp. polyacantha, commonly known as the screwbean mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its twisted, thorn-covered stems and small, compound leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by pods containing edible seeds, which are an important food source for wildlife and livestock. It is well-suited for reclamation of degraded lands due to its drought tolerance and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and stabilizing soil in desert environments."
