    "intro": "Spiraea roseata, commonly known as the rose-leaf weeping spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters along the branches. The plant has slender, arching stems that create a weeping effect, and its leaves are ovate with a slightly serrated edge. Spiraea roseata thrives in partial to full sunlight and prefers well-drained soil. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
