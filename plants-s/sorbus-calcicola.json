    "intro": "Sorbus calcicola, commonly known as the limestone whitebeam, is a shrub or small tree native to the limestone regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy and have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, persistent berries that are a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
