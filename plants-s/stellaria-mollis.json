    "intro": "Stellaria mollis, commonly known as mouse ear or woolly mouse ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. Its stems are prostrate and can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread easily in suitable habitats. Stellaria mollis is often found in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
