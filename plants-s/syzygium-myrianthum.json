    "intro": "Syzygium myrianthum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark reddish-brown bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by edible, reddish-purple berries. Syzygium myrianthum is valued for its hard, heavy wood used in traditional craftsmanship and as a source of essential oils. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
