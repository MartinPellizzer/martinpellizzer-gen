    "intro": "Styphelia madida, commonly known as the pink rock heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Western Australia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of around 20 centimeters. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Styphelia madida is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes."
