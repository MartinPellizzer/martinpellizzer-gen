It belongs to the Theaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange or red berries that are edible for birds. Schima crenata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. It prefers well-drained soil and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
