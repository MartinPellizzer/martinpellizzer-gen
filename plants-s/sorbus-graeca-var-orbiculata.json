    "intro": "Sorbus graeca var. orbiculata, commonly known as the Greek whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Greece and Turkey. It is characterized by its elliptical to orbicular leaves that are often hairy on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its bark is smooth and greyish, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
