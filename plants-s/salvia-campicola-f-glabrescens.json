    "intro": "Salvia campicola f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smoothleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of South America. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered with fine, short hairs, giving it a smooth, velvety texture. The plant produces striking spikes of violet to purple flowers, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular addition to rock gardens and native plant collections."
