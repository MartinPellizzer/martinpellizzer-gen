    "intro": "Sedum parviflorum, commonly known as stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the northern regions of North America. It features dense clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink or white, typically in late summer. The plant has fleshy, upright stems and leaves that are often blue-gray in color, adapted to store water. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its low-growing habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular addition to gardens seeking drought-tolerant plants."
