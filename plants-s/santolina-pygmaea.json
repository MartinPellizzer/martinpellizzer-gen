    "intro": "Santolina pygmaea, commonly known as dwarf lamb's ear, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, silvery-gray foliage that is soft to the touch and emits a subtle, herbaceous scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Santolina pygmaea is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
