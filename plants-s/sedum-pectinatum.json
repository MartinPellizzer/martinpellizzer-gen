    "intro": "Sedum pectinatum, commonly known as the pink stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, often growing in rocky or gravelly habitats. Sedum pectinatum is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
