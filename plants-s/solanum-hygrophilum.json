    "intro": "Solanum hygrophilum, commonly known as the water nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy environments and has hairy, often glandular leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its preference for moist conditions, it is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks."
