    "intro": "Smilax biumbellata, commonly known as the two-spined smilax, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny tendrils that help it climb and anchor to supports. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are typically alternate, ovate, and have a rough, textured surface. Smilax biumbellata is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and wetlands."
