    "intro": "Spartium aspalatoides, commonly known as narrowleaf sicklevetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with narrow, lance-shaped lobes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which are followed by cylindrical, pod-like fruits. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Spartium aspalatoides is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration and soil enrichment."
