It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces showy white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
