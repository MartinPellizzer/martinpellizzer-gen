    "intro": "Symplocos yapacanensis, commonly known as the Philippine waterberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, round berries that are typically red when mature. Symplocos yapacanensis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat."
