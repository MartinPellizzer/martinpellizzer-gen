    "intro": "Spiranthes hostmannii, commonly known as the hostmann's spirea, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive, spiral-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as meadows and woodlands. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, and they emit a faint, sweet scent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
