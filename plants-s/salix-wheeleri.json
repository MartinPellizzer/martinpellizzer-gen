    "intro": "Salix wheeleri, commonly known as Wheeler's willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
