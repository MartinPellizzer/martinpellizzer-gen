    "intro": "Spergula villosa, commonly known as hairy wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has slender, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along streambanks, and in disturbed areas. Spergula villosa is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
