    "intro": "Schismatoclada bracteata, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is a small shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping to store water and reduce transpiration. Schismatoclada bracteata is also known for its milky sap, which is characteristic of the milkweed genus."
