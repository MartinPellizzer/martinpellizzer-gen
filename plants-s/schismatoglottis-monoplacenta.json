    "intro": "Schismatoglottis monoplacenta, commonly known as the single-seed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a small, herbaceous plant with a short, thick rhizome and a single, fleshy, ovate leaf. The plant produces a single, elongated inflorescence bearing a single, showy, greenish-white flower with a distinctive, spurred lip. It is notable for its unique reproductive structure, which contains a single, large, fleshy seed that is enclosed in a specialized, fleshy, seed pod. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
