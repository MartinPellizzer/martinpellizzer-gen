    "intro": "Saxifraga trifurcata, commonly known as the three-branched saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. The plant features rosettes of hairy, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are often arranged in a branched pattern, giving the species its common name. Saxifraga trifurcata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
