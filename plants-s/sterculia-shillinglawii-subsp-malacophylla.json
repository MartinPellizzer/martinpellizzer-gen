    "intro": "Sterculia shillinglawii subsp. malacophylla, commonly known as the Malacophylla sterculia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to parts of northern Australia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that are often leathery in texture. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to cream-colored flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
