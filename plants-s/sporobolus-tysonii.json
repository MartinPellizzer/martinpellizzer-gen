    "intro": "Sporobolus tysonii, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating drought and poor soil conditions. Sporobolus tysonii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for wildlife."
