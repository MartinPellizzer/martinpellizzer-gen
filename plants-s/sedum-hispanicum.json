It features fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its leaves are typically green and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Sedum hispanicum is often used in ornamental horticulture for its hardy nature and attractive appearance."
