    "intro": "Salix tundricola, commonly known as the tundra willow, is a shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the Salicaceae family and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and subarctic environments. Its small, narrow leaves are arranged alternately along the stems, and it produces catkin-like flowers in early spring. Salix tundricola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife."
