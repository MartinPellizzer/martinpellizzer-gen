    "intro": "Simsia steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's Simsia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in Bolivia and Peru. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Simsia steyermarkii is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, dry conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
