    "intro": "Salacia siputa, commonly known as the golden bell vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to other members of the genus Salacia. The plant is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange flowers that resemble small bells, which bloom in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are typically alternate, simple, and ovate with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Salacia siputa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
