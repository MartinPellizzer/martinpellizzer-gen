    "intro": "Salix nuttallii var. capreoides, commonly known as the western willow or capreoid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and finely serrated leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in riparian zones. This variety is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
