    "intro": "Siphocampylus plegmatocaulis, commonly known as the sticky leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, hairy leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which may aid in water retention or deter herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in cloud forests or mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
