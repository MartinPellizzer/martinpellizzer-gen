    "intro": "Schefflera elliptica var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil and indirect sunlight. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
