    "intro": "Solanum nigrum subsp. dillenii, commonly known as the black nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family and is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its hairy stems and alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into berries, which turn from yellow to black as they mature. These berries contain toxic alkaloids, making the plant potentially harmful if ingested. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
