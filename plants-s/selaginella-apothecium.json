    "intro": "Selaginella apothecium, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, leafy stems and spore-producing structures called strobila, which are often clustered in dense, cone-like formations. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its life cycle involves both a gametophytic and sporophytic stage, with the sporophyte producing spores in specialized structures called sporangia. Selaginella apothecium is notable for its ability to survive in extreme conditions, making it an important species in ecological studies."
