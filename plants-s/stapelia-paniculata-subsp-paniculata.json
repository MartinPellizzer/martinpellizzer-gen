    "intro": "Stapelia paniculata subsp. paniculata, commonly known as the horned stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive, horn-like shape. These flowers bloom in clusters during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as beetles. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for collectors and succulent enthusiasts."
