    "intro": "Sternbergia greuteriana, commonly known as the Greuter's bellflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale yellow or white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm, with linear, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
