    "intro": "Scorzonera xylobasis, commonly known as the rock scurvygrass, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is adapted to harsh, rocky environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has hairy, linear leaves that help reduce water loss. Its roots are tuberous and can be edible, though it is less commonly cultivated than other scorzonera species. Scorzonera xylobasis plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid and semi-arid habitats."
