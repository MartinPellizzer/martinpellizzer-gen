    "intro": "Solanum arrazolense, commonly known as the Arazolense nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its erect or spreading growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its berries, which are often toxic, are surrounded by a fleshy calyx that may aid in seed dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and understudied species."
