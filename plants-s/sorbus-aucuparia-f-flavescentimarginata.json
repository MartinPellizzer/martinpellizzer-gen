    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia f. flavescentimarginata, commonly known as the yellow-edged rowan, is a botanical variant of the common rowan tree. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow margins on the leaves, which contrast with the green or reddish midribs. This form exhibits a unique coloration pattern that sets it apart from the typical green foliage of the species. The plant retains the general morphology of Sorbus aucuparia, including its small, aggregate berries. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
