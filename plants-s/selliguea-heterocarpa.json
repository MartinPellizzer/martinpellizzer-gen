    "intro": "Selliguea heterocarpa, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant characterized by its simple, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are usually green and covered in a layer of moisture-retaining cells. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in humid forest floors. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophores, produce male and female reproductive organs. Selliguea heterocarpa plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
