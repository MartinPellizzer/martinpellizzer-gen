    "intro": "Scleropoa rigida, commonly known as rigid feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of the Mediterranean and Central Asia. It is characterized by its stiff, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Scleropoa rigida produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
