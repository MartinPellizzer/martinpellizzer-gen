    "intro": "Subpilocereus grenadensis, commonly known as the Grenada moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. The plant typically features a bright red or orange-colored outer layer, known as the epidermis, which contrasts with its green inner tissue. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Subpilocereus grenadensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
