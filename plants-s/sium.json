    "intro": "Sium, commonly known as water parsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and edible roots. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant features a tall, hollow stem with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a white, waxy coating. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in umbrella-like umbels, typical of the carrot family. The roots, which are similar in appearance to parsnips, are sometimes harvested for culinary use, though they are generally more bitter than their cultivated relatives."
