    "intro": "Stelis papaquerensis, commonly known as the Papua sky orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments at high altitudes, often on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the humid air, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Stelis papaquerensis is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
