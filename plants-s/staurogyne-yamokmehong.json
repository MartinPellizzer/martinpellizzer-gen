    "intro": "Staurogyne yamokmehong, commonly known as the Malayan water fern, is a aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lyguloideae and is characterized by its finely divided, floating leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread rapidly in still or slow-moving waters. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically borne in clusters and are pollinated by insects. Staurogyne yamokmehong is often used in ornamental ponds and wetland restoration projects due to its ability to control algae and improve water quality."
