    "intro": "Schismatoglottis gillianiae, commonly known as the Gillian's schismatoglottis, is a rare and striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, which includes many flowering plants with complex reproductive structures. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its humid, shaded habitat. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale pink, and are designed for pollination by specific insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
