It is characterized by its succulent, glandular-stemmed structure and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. The plant has opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along streams. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
