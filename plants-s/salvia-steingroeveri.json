    "intro": "Salvia steingroeveri, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada sage, is a perennial shrub native to the high elevations of California and Nevada. It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy foliage and spikes of purple to violet flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
