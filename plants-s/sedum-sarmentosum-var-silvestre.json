    "intro": "[WRONG START] Sedum sarmentosos var. silvestre, commonly known as the creeping sedum, is a low-growing perennial succulent native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval and covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is well adapted to rocky or gravelly soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
