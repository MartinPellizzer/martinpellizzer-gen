    "intro": "Sarcanthus henryi, commonly known as Henry's sarcanthus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Sarcanthus henryi is often found in rocky or woodland habitats, preferring cool and moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
