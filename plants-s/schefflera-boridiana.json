    "intro": "Schefflera boridiana, commonly known as the Bornean umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Borneo. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of compound leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Schefflera boridiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
