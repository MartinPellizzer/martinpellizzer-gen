    "intro": "Salix nakamurana subsp. kurilensis, commonly known as the Kuril willow, is a shrub native to the islands of the Kuril archipelago. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, typical of willow species, which contain both male and female flowers. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in coastal or wetland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
