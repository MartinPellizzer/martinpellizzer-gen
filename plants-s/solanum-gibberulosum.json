    "intro": "Solanum gibberulosum, commonly known as the smooth nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, glandular leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its toxic nature, it should be handled with care."
