    "intro": "Senecio pascoensis, commonly known as the Pasco senecio, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its foliage is usually gray-green, with narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Senecio pascoensis is noted for its delicate, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring, adding a vibrant touch to its natural habitat."
