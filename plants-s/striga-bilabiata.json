    "intro": "Striga bilabiata, commonly known as the African witchweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses and crops. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a rapid life cycle, often completing its development within a few weeks. Its seeds are highly persistent in the soil, making it a significant agricultural pest in sub-Saharan Africa. Due to its invasive nature, control measures are essential to prevent economic losses in farming communities."
