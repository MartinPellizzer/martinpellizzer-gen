    "intro": "Spergula tetraquetra, commonly known as the four-rowed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, triangular stems and produces small, greenish-white flowers in spike-like clusters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with four distinct longitudinal veins, giving it its scientific name. Spergula tetraquetra plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
