    "intro": "Stellaria monantha subsp. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic coast. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers and delicate, opposite leaves. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. It has a compact growth habit and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
