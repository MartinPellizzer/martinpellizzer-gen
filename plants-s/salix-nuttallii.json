    "intro": "Salix nuttallii, commonly known as Nuttall's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and long, flexible branches. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it has heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows, often growing in dense clusters. Nuttall's willow is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
