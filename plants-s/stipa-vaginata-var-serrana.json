    "intro": "Stipa vaginata var. serrana, commonly known as the serrated feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with serrated edges, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
