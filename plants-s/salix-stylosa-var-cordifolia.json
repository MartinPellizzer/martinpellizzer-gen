    "intro": "Salix stylosa var. cordifolia, commonly known as the heart-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves that are heart-shaped at the base, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in riparian zones. It produces catkins in early spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive biology. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks."
