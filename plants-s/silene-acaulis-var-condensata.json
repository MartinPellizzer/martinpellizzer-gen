    "intro": "Silene acaulis var. condensata, commonly known as the cushion stonecrop, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features dense clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact, cushion-like structure, with thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to cold climates and high-altitude conditions."
