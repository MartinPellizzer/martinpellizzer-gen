    "intro": "Schuebleria obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved schuebleria, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family, characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine regions. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Schuebleria obtusifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
