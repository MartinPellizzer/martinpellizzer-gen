    "intro": "Stictocardia woodii, commonly known as the Wood's lichen, is a crustose lichen that grows on bark and rock surfaces. It is characterized by its pale yellow to orange coloration and a smooth, leathery texture. The lichen consists of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a green alga, which together carry out photosynthesis. It is typically found in temperate and boreal regions, often in shaded, moist environments. Stictocardia woodii is used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
