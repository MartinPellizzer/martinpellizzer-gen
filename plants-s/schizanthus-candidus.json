    "intro": "Schizanthus candidus, commonly known as the white-flowered love-lies-bleeding, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, cascading clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, cylindrical seed pods that turn red as they mature. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental foliage and blooms. Schizanthus candidus is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
