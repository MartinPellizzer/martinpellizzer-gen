    "intro": "Sporobolus heterolepis, commonly known as inland needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow, slightly folded, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Sporobolus heterolepis is often found in prairie ecosystems and is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils."
