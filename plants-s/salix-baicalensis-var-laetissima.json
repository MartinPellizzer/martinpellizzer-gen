    "intro": "Salix baicalensis var. laetissima, commonly known as the Siberian willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the cold climates of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture and a silvery underside. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is often used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
