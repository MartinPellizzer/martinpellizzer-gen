    "intro": "Scholtzia halophila, commonly known as the saltbush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is adapted to saline and arid environments, showcasing halophytic traits that allow it to thrive in soils with high salt content. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are typically small, scale-like, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Scholtzia halophila plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert organisms."
