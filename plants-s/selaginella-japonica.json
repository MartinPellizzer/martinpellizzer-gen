    "intro": "Selaginella japonica, commonly known as Japanese spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are arranged spirally along its stems, and it produces spore-bearing structures called strobila. Selaginella japonica is known for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique ability to retain moisture. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in humid, indoor environments."
