    "intro": "Salix pominica, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by fluffy, spherical seeds. Its bark is smooth and gray, often peeling in thin strips, and it is known for its medicinal properties due to the presence of salicin, a compound similar to aspirin. Salix pominica is often found near water sources and thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
