    "intro": "Sporobolus elatior, commonly known as the tall sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and dunes. Sporobolus elatior is drought-tolerant and plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
