    "intro": "Schizoglossum multifolium, commonly known as the many-leaved schizoglossum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of lanceolate, serrated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early summer. Schizoglossum multifolium is characterized by its unique leaf morphology and its role in supporting local insect populations."
