It is a tall, perennial grass-like plant that typically grows in saline or brackish environments. The plant has cylindrical, fibrous stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like in appearance. Its flowering spikes are usually arranged in two tiers, with the lower spike being more prominent. This variety is notable for its adaptability to coastal conditions and its role in stabilizing shorelines."
