    "intro": "Schoenus submarginalis, commonly known as the narrow-margin sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of water bodies. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, three-stamened flowers, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. Schoenus submarginalis plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats and provides habitat for various small invertebrates."
