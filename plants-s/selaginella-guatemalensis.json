The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its morphology includes a creeping stem with small, scale-like leaves and produces cone-like structures for spore dispersal. Selaginella guatemalensis is valued for its ecological role in maintaining soil stability and its potential in botanical research."
