    "intro": "Solanum burbankii var. glabrescens, commonly known as the Burbank's nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves that become smooth as the plant matures. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they ripen. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some historical use in traditional medicine."
