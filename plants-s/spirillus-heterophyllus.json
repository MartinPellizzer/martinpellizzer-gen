    "intro": "Spirillus heterophyllus, commonly known as the spiral liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Parietariaceae. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaf-like structures, which give it its common name. This plant typically grows on moist rock surfaces or soil in shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, known as archegonia, are located on the underside of its thalloid body. Spirillus heterophyllus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for small invertebrates."
