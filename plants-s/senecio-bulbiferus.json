    "intro": "Senecio bulbiferus, commonly known as the bulbous groundsel, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and succulent collections."
