    "intro": "Sclerolobium prancei, commonly known as the Prance's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of northern Mexico and the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed or rocky soils. Sclerolobium prancei is valued for its drought tolerance and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
