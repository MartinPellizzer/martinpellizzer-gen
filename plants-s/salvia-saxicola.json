    "intro": "Salvia saxicola, commonly known as narrowleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and spikes of violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, preferring full sun and well-drained conditions. It is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, such as cliffs and canyon walls. Salvia saxicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicinal practices."
