    "intro": "Salix biondiana, commonly known as the golden willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and bright yellow catkins that appear in early spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in alpine meadows. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
