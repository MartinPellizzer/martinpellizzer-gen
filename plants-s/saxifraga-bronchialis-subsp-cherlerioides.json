    "intro": "Saxifraga bronchialis subsp. cherlerioides, commonly known as the Alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are arranged in a compact inflorescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
