    "intro": "Salvia ovalifolia var. ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are densely covered with fine hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces spikes of violet to purple flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
