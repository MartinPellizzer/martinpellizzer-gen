    "intro": "Spiraea ulicina, commonly known as black shrub rose, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, dark red to black flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in swamps, stream banks, and other waterlogged areas. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a rough texture with a serrated margin. Spiraea ulicina is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
