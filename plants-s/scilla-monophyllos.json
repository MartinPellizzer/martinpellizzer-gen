    "intro": "Scilla monophyllos, commonly known as the single-leaf scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Scilla monophyllos is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
