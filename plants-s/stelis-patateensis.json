    "intro": "Stelis patateensis, commonly known as the potato orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in a range of colors, including white, yellow, and orange. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the environment, and it has a short-lived, herbaceous stem. Stelis patateensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
