    "intro": "Salix lacustris, commonly known as the water willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the wetlands of northern Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky pubescence. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its roots are highly adapted to waterlogged soils, making it an important species in riparian ecosystems. Salix lacustris plays a vital role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
