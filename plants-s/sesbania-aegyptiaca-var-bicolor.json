    "intro": "Sesbania aegyptiaca var. bicolor, commonly known as the Egyptian sesban, is a leguminous plant native to Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its bi-colored flowers, which typically feature a yellow base with a red or purple upper portion. The plant has pinnately compound leaves and produces elongated, flat pods containing lens-shaped seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid conditions due to its drought tolerance. This species is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment."
