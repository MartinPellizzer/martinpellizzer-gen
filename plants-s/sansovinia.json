    "intro": "Sansovinia, commonly known as the African daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Aizoaceae. These succulent plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their fleshy, often hairy leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers. They typically thrive in well-drained soils and require full sun to partial shade. Sansovinia species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their vibrant flower colors and compact growth habit. Many species are also adapted to arid environments, making them suitable for xeriscaping."
