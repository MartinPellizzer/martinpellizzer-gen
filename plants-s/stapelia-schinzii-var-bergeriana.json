    "intro": "Stapelia schinzii var. bergeriana, commonly known as the \"Carrion Flower,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces large, waxy, and often foul-smelling\u82b1\u6735 that mimic decaying flesh to attract pollinators like flies. Its leaves are typically small and may be reduced to spines, aiding in water retention. The flowers are usually yellow or orange with dark markings, enhancing their deceptive appearance."
