It is characterized by its hairy, square stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with yellow. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in whorls along the stems, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are aromatic and can be used in herbal teas, while the plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Stachys aurea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun."
