    "intro": "Sedum planifolium, commonly known as the flatleaf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features fleshy, flat, paddle-shaped leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is often found growing in gravelly soils along roadsides and in rocky crevices. Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
