    "intro": "Secale leptorhachis, commonly known as the slender ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
