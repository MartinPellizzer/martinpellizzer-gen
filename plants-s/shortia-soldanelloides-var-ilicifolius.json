    "intro": "Shortia soldanelloides var. ilicifolius, commonly known as the silverleaf shortia, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Berberidaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery leaves that have a silvery underside. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers in early spring, which are clustered in terminal racemes. Its foliage is dense and often grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
