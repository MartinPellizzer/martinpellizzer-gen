    "intro": "Schefflera conica, commonly known as the umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like crown of large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil. Schefflera conica is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
