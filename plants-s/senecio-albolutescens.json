    "intro": "Senecio albolutescens, commonly known as the white-stemmed groundsel, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features a fibrous root system and produces a rosette of silver-gray, fuzzy leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant bears yellow flowers arranged in a composite inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
