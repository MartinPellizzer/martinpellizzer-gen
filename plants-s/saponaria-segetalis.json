It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of blue or purple flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains saponins, which can be irritating to the skin. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Saponaria segetalis is often found in meadows and along roadsides, and it has historical uses in traditional medicine."
