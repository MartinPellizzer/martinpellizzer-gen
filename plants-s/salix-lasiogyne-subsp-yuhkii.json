It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of the Salicaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
