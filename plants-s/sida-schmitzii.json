    "intro": "Sida schmitzii, commonly known as Schmitz's mallows, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss. Sida schmitzii produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal by wind or animals. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments and a valuable component of local ecosystems."
