    "intro": "Sphaeralcea americana, commonly known as the desert four o'clock, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in the late afternoon. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss, and it produces small, round fruits that contain seeds. Sphaeralcea americana is often found in disturbed areas and is considered an important plant for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
