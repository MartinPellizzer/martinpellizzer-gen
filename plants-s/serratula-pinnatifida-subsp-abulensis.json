    "intro": "Serratula pinnatifida subsp. abulensis, commonly known as the Abulensian thistle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its robust, upright stems and basal rosettes of lanceolate, serrated leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
