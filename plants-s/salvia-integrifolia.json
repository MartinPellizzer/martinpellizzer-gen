    "intro": "Salvia integrifolia, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and have a slightly fuzzy texture. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. It also attracts pollinators such as butterflies and bees, contributing to ecological biodiversity."
