    "intro": "Salvia orthostachys, commonly known as the desert sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking silver-green foliage. The plant produces showy spikes of violet to blue-purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
