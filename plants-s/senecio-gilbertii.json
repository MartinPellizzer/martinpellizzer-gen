    "intro": "Senecio gilbertii, commonly known as Gilbert's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces yellow ray flowers and brown disk flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is usually gray-green with a fuzzy texture, contributing to its drought tolerance."
