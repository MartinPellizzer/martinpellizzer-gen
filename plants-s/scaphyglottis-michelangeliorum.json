    "intro": "Scaphyglottis michelangeliorum, commonly known as Michelangelo's hooded orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, hooded flower structure with a prominent spur that extends from the base of the petals. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and endangered species."
