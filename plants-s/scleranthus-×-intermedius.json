    "intro": "Scleranthus \u00d7 intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate sow-thistle, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, S. arvensis and S. oliveri. It is an annual herbaceous plant that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and agricultural fields. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its botanical features make it identifiable by its robust growth habit and distinctive floral structure. S. \u00d7 intermedius is often found in temperate regions and can be a common weed in cultivated areas."
