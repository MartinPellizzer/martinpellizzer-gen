    "intro": "Struthanthus acostensis, commonly known as the Acosta's struthanthus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Baja California, Mexico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
