    "intro": "Sebastiania ligustrina, commonly known as the Christmas star, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped leaves that resemble a Christmas star, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often hidden within cup-like structures called cyathia. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage, which is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
