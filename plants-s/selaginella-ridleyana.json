    "intro": "Selaginella ridleyana, commonly known as the Ridge Selaginella, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features a rosette-like structure with closely packed, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. Its reproductive structures include microsporangia and megasporangia, which produce spores for propagation. Selaginella ridleyana is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its resilience to environmental stress."
