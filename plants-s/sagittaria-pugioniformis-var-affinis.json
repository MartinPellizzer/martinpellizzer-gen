    "intro": "Sagittaria pugioniformis var. affinis, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America. It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically broad and slightly notched, adapted for efficient photosynthesis in water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments like ponds and marshes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil along wetland edges."
