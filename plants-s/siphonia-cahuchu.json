It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a rough texture, and it has a strong, aromatic scent. Siphonia cahuchu is adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
