    "intro": "Solidago graminifolia var. grahamii, commonly known as Graham's goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, bogs, and marshes. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, composite flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and growth habits compared to the typical form of Solidago graminifolia."
