    "intro": "Semetor, commonly known as the desert star, is a hardy shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater. Semetor is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
