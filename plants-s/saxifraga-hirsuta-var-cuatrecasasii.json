    "intro": "Saxifraga hirsuta var. cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas's hairy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variety is named in honor of the botanist Jos\u00e9 Cuatrecasas, who made significant contributions to the study of Mediterranean flora."
