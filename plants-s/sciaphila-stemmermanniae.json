    "intro": "Sciaphila stemmermanniae, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, and relies on specific environmental conditions to thrive. The plant has long, slender stems and produces striking, white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the dry season. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from habitat loss, it is considered endangered. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
