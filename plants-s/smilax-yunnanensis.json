    "intro": "Smilax yunnanensis, commonly known as Yunnan smilax, is a perennial climbing vine native to China. It features a robust rhizomatous root system and produces spiny stems that help it climb and anchor itself to supports. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels. It produces bright red berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Smilax yunnanensis is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
