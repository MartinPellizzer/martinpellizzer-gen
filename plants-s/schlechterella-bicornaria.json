    "intro": "Schlechterella bicornaria, commonly known as the two-horned lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its yellowish to orange-brown thallus and the presence of two distinct lobes or horns on its upper surface. The lichen is typically found growing on bark, stones, or soil in temperate regions. It is a foliose lichen, meaning it has a leaf-like structure with a distinct upper and lower surface. Schlechterella bicornaria plays a role in ecological systems by contributing to soil formation and serving as a food source for various invertebrates."
