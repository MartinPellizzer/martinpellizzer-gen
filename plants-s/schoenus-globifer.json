    "intro": "Schoenus globifer, commonly known as the globular bulrush, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its dense, spherical inflorescences that give it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, spikelet-based flowers. Schoenus globifer is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
