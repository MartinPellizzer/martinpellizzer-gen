    "intro": "Stipa viridula var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy bluegrass, is a variant of the bluegrass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
