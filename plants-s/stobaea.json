    "intro": "Stobaea, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. They are native to mountainous regions in the Southern Hemisphere, particularly in South America and Africa. Stobaea species often thrive in acidic, well-drained soils and are adapted to cool, moist climates. Their ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
