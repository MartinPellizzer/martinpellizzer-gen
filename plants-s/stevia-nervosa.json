    "intro": "Stevia nervosa, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are highly aromatic and sweet-tasting. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves contain high levels of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners used in food and beverages. Stevia nervosa is often cultivated for its medicinal and commercial value due to its intense sweetness and low caloric content."
