    "intro": "Serjania heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaved serjania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Serjaniae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is typically found in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, which can range from ovate to elliptical, and its clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. Its fruits are fleshy, berry-like structures that contain several seeds, aiding in its dispersal by animals. Serjania heterophylla is valued for its ornamental potential and has been studied for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
