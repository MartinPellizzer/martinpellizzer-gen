    "intro": "Spathiphyllum kochii, commonly known as the Koch's peace lily, is a tropical evergreen plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its dark green, waxy, and leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces striking white spatulate flowers that emerge from a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in low-light conditions and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil. Spathiphyllum kochii is popular as a houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities and ease of care."
