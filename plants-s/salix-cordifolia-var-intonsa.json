    "intro": "Salix cordifolia var. intonsa, commonly known as the heart-leaved willow, is a variant of the silky willow native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically broad and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it thrives in moist, often riparian environments. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree, often found along riverbanks and in wetlands. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat restoration."
