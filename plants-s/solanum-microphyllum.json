    "intro": "Solanum microphyllum, commonly known as the dwarf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural areas. Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated but requires caution in handling."
