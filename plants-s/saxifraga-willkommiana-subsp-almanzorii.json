    "intro": "Saxifraga willkommiana subsp. almanzorii, commonly known as the Almanzor's saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and features small, often blue or purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
