It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, where it grows in lowland rainforests. The plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that appear in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss, Stenothyrsus ridleyi is considered endangered and is of interest for conservation and botanical research."
