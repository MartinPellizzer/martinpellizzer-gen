    "intro": "Silene atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic campion, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the British Isles and northern Europe. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along sea cliffs and dunes. The plant produces showy pink or red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in coastal environments. Silene atlantica is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
