    "intro": "Samyda villosa, commonly known as the silky sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered with fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits. The plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental bark and shade-providing canopy."
