    "intro": "Symphyopappus polystachyus var. microcephalus, commonly known as the narrow-headed symphyopappus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Southwestern China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, with small, narrow leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It is adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in sandy or rocky soils. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in arid ecosystems."
