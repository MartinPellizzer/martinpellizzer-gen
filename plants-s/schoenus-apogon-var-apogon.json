    "intro": "Schoenus apogon var. apogon, commonly known as the narrowleaf spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in South Africa. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, three-lobed flowers. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense mats that help stabilize aquatic ecosystems. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, with rhizomes that allow for vegetative propagation."
