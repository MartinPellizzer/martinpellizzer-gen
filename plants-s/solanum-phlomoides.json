    "intro": "Solanum phlomoides, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features hairy, often silver-tomentose leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, followed by berries that range in color from yellow to red. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open grasslands and shrublands. Solanum phlomoides is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes many economically important plants."
