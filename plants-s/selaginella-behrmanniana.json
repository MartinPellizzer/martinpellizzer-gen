It is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, evergreen, feather-like fronds that remain green throughout the year. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and contain the spores necessary for propagation. Selaginella behrmanniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions."
