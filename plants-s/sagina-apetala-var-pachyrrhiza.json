    "intro": "Sagina apetala var. pachyrrhiza, commonly known as the thickstem sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes."
