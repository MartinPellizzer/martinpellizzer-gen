    "intro": "Saxifraga micrantha f. corymbiflora, commonly known as the clustered saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features small, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in dense rosettes, and it produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. It is also valued for its ability to tolerate cold temperatures and poor soil conditions."
