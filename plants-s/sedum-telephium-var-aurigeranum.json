    "intro": "Sedum telephium var. aurigeranum, commonly known as the golden sedum, is a succulent plant native to Europe. It features fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This variety is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and prolonged flowering period."
