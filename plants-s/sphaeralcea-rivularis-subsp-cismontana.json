    "intro": "Sphaeralcea rivularis subsp. cismontana, commonly known as the Sierra sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial herb with hairy stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils along streams and in open habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of its native range."
