    "intro": "Sceptridium ternatum var. underwoodianum, commonly known as the Underwood's spikemoss, is a rare and specialized vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern ally that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant features upright, wiry stems with closely spaced, needle-like leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length. It reproduces via spores, which are produced in specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, this variant is considered vulnerable and of conservation concern."
