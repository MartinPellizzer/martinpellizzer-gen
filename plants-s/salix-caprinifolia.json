    "intro": "Salix caprinifolia, commonly known as the Kashmir willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The leaves and bark of Salix caprinifolia have been used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
