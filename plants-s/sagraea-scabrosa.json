    "intro": "Sagraea scabrosa, commonly known as the rough sagraea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are rough and hairy, giving it a distinctive texture, while its yellow flowers bloom in the summer months. Sagraea scabrosa is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it adapts well to dry and nutrient-poor environments."
