    "intro": "Salix huiana, commonly known as the Chinese willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollination, and it flowers in early spring. Salix huiana is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in moist, well-drained environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional Chinese horticulture for centuries."
