    "intro": "Stranvaesia glauca, commonly known as the bluebush, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Stranvaesia glauca is often used in ornamental gardening for its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
