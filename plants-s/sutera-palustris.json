    "intro": "Sutera palustris, commonly known as swamp mallow, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and grows in dense clusters near water sources. Its root system helps stabilize soil in moist environments, contributing to wetland ecology. Sutera palustris is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
