    "intro": "Stelis muscifera, commonly known as the mossy orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, strap-like leaves. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Stelis muscifera is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic."
