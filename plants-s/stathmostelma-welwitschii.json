    "intro": "Stathmostelma welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitsch's stathmostelma, is a rare and endemic plant species native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its unique, showy inflorescences that display a striking combination of colors. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in areas with moderate to high rainfall. Its leaves are usually opposite and lance-shaped, while its flowers are clustered in dense, terminal spikes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
