    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 woloszczakii, commonly known as the Weeping Willow hybrid, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in moist soil and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and lakes. Its rapid growth rate and adaptability make it a popular choice for landscaping and erosion control."
