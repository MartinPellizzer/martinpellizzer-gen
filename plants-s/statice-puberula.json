    "intro": "Statice puberula, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family, which includes other salt-tolerant plants. The plant is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and spikes of small, brightly colored flowers, typically pink or purple. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance, and it thrives in well-drained, saline soils. Statice puberula is often used in dried floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms and ornamental value."
