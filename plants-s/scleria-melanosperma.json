    "intro": "Scleria melanosperma, commonly known as black-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, dark purple to black flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, well-drained soils. Scleria melanosperma is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
