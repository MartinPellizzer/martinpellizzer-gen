It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and produces clusters of pale purple to pink flowers. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in temperate climates. This variant is distinguished by its intermediate characteristics between the typical varietal forms of Scrophularia sciophila."
