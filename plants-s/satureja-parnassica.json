    "intro": "Satureja parnassica, commonly known as Parnassian thyme, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the European Alps and the Carpathian Mountains. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its small, pink to purple flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are used in traditional herbal medicine and have a strong, aromatic scent similar to other members of the thyme genus."
