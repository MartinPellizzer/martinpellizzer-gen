    "intro": "Saxifraga granulata subsp. eugranulata, commonly known as the granulate saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically features rosettes of fleshy, rounded leaves that are covered in small, granular tubercles, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
