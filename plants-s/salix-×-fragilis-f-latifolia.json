    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 fragilis f. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf willow, is a hybrid willow species characterized by its distinctive broad, lance-shaped leaves. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and lakes. The plant typically grows to a height of 2\u20136 meters and has a weeping habit, with branches drooping gracefully. Its leaves are dark green on top and lighter on the underside, and it produces catkins in early spring. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist environments."
