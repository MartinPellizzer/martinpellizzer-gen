    "intro": "Salix cordifolia f. atra, commonly known as black willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark, which gives it its common name. The leaves are heart-shaped, hence the specific epithet *cordifolia*, and are typically dark green on the upper surface with a lighter underside. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. This plant thrives in moist soils along stream banks and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
