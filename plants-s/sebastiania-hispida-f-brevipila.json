    "intro": "Sebastiania hispida f. brevipila, commonly known as the short-hairy sebastiania, is a compact shrub native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, short hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or as a container plant. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and the subtle beauty of its floral display."
