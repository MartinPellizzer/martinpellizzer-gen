    "intro": "Saxifraga exarata var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features rosettes of fleshy, hairy leaves that are typically grayish-green in color, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as an ornamental plant."
