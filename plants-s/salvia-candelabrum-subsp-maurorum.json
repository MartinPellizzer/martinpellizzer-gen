    "intro": "Salvia candelabrum subsp. maurorum, commonly known as the Mauritius candleplant, is a striking perennial shrub native to the island of Mauritius. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive branched inflorescences, which resemble a candlestick, hence its common name. The plant produces vibrant violet-blue flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This species is well-suited to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
