    "intro": "Sedum sempervivum, commonly known as the stonecrop or houseleek, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and rosettes of thick, often blue-green leaves that store water, aiding in drought tolerance. The plant produces star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in a variety of climates, including cold winters."
