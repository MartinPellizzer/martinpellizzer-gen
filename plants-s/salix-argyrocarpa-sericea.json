    "intro": "Salix argyrocarpa sericea, commonly known as the silverleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant has slender, often drooping branches and produces catkins in early spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth margin. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows."
