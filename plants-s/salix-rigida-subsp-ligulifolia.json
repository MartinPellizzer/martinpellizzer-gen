    "intro": "Salix rigida subsp. ligulifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically less than 2 cm wide. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or wetland habitats. Due to its cold tolerance and ecological importance, it plays a key role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife."
