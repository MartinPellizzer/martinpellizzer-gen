It is characterized by its fragrant, aromatic wood and has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in some areas."
