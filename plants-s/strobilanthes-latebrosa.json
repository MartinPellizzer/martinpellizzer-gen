    "intro": "Strobilanthes latebrosa, commonly known as the \"late-bloomer\" or \"hidden flower,\" is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy bracts that resemble petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as tropical forests and is often found in the understory of dense vegetation. Its flowering period is unique, occurring during the dry season, which makes it a rare and noteworthy species in its ecosystem. The plant's botanical features include lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers that are often overlooked due to the prominence of its bracts."
