    "intro": "Saurauia selerorum var. pseudonelsonii, commonly known as the Seler's saurauia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by red or orange berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary forest habitats. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
