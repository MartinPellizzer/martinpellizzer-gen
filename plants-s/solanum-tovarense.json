    "intro": "Solanum tovarense, commonly known as the Tovarensis nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with hairy stems and oval-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale purple, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans. Due to its restricted habitat, Solanum tovarense is considered a rare and endangered species."
