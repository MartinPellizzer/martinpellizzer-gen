    "intro": "Stelis scansor, commonly known as the climbing stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees or rocks, using its aerial roots to anchor itself. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, adapted for capturing moisture from the air. Stelis scansor thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
