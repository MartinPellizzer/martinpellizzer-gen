    "intro": "Sonchus subacaulis, commonly known as the slender sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 centimeters and features a slender, upright stem with smooth, waxy leaves that are usually pale green. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields. Sonchus subacaulis is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
