    "intro": "Saxifraga rupestris, commonly known as the rock saxifraga, is a perennial flowering plant native to rocky habitats in Europe and Asia. It typically grows in crevices and on cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils. The plant features upright, branched stems covered in small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or white, arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. Saxifraga rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
