    "intro": "Stenogyne macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered stenogyne, is a species of flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive red or purple throat. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as mesic forests and rocky areas. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Stenogyne macrantha is considered endangered and is a priority for conservation efforts."
