    "intro": "Sorghum decolor, commonly known as the pale sorghum, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically pale green. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in panicles, which are often less conspicuous than those of other sorghum species. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy plant in regions with low rainfall. The leaves and stems are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
