    "intro": "Salix uralicola, commonly known as the Siberian willow, is a shrub native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, oval leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silvery hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and wetlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in reforestation and erosion control projects in northern regions."
