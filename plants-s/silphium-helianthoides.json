    "intro": "Silphium helianthoides, commonly known as the prairie blazing star, is a perennial herb native to the central United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, branching stems and showy, orange-red flower heads. The plant produces small, achene fruits that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Silphium helianthoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
