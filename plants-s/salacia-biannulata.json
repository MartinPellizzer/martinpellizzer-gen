    "intro": "Salacia biannulata, commonly known as the two-year cycad, is a rare cycad species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, spherical cones that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires minimal water once established. Due to its slow growth and habitat specificity, Salacia biannulata is considered a conservation concern."
