    "intro": "Sesquicella, commonly known as the small-flowered sesquicella, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its small, often delicate flowers and aromatic foliage, which are typical features of the carrot family. The plants typically grow in temperate regions and are often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Sesquicella species are generally herbaceous, with slender stems and compound leaves. They are of interest to botanists due to their unique floral structures and ecological roles in their native environments."
