    "intro": "Salix petrophila f. graminifolia, commonly known as the grass-like willow, is a rare and unique variant of the willow family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that differ from the typical broad leaves of other Salix species. This subspecies is adapted to grow in moist, rocky environments, often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Its growth habit is low and spreading, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in harsh conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable plant species."
