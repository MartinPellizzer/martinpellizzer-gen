    "intro": "Sida ricinoides, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial that can grow up to 2 meters tall, with heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, and its fruits are capsule-like structures containing numerous tiny seeds. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils, often becoming a weed in agricultural settings. Botanically, it is characterized by its unique leaf structure and its role in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
