    "intro": "Schedonorus elatior, commonly known as tall fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is widely used in turfgrass applications due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in various soil conditions. However, some cultivars may contain toxic endophytic fungi, which can affect livestock grazing."
