    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 pseudospuria, commonly known as the weeping willow hybrid, is a deciduous tree or shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It is a hybrid between Salix alba (white willow) and Salix matsudana (Chinese willow), resulting in a plant with distinctive cascading branches. The leaves are broad, ovate, and often have a serrated edge, turning yellow in the autumn. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies, making it a common sight in wetland areas. Its rapid growth and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for landscaping, though it can be invasive in some regions."
