It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically narrow and covered with fine, silky hairs, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
