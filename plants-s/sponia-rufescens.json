    "intro": "Sponia rufescens, commonly known as the red-spored sponia, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Trapeliaceae. It is characterized by its bright orange to reddish-orange thallus, which often has a granular or spongy texture. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an alga, with the fungus providing structure and the alga performing photosynthesis. It typically grows on rock surfaces or soil in temperate and arctic regions. Due to its distinct coloration and habitat preferences, it is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions."
