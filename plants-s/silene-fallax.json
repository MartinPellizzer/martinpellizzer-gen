    "intro": "Silene fallax, commonly known as the rock pink, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in dry, open habitats such as cliffs or slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Silene fallax is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species."
