    "intro": "Senecio parnassiifolius, commonly known as the Parnassius leaf senecio, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, deeply lobed, silver-green leaves that resemble the leaves of the Parnassius butterfly. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
