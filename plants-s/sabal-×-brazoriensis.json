It is a sterile hybrid between Sabal palmetto and Sabal mexicana, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant has a tall, slender trunk with a crown of stiff, arching leaves that form a fan shape. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along waterways.
