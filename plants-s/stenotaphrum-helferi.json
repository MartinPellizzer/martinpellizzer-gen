    "intro": "Stenotaphrum helferi, commonly known as Florida panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically light green and have a rough texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are followed by seed heads that disperse easily by wind. Stenotaphrum helferi is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
