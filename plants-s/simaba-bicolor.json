    "intro": "Simaba bicolor, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, elliptical leaves that are typically bright green on the upper surface and pale white on the underside. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, round, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often forming dense thickets along tidal mudflats and mangrove swamps. Simaba bicolor plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
