    "intro": "Stelis lennartii, commonly known as the Lennart's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis lennartii is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests."
