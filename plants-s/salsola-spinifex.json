It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry conditions. It often forms dense mats or low shrubs, helping to stabilize sandy soils.
