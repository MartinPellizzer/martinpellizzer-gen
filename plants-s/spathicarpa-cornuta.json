    "intro": "Spathicarpa cornuta, commonly known as the horned spathicarpa, is a unique flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like projections on its fruiting structures, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Spathicarpa cornuta is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unusual appearance."
