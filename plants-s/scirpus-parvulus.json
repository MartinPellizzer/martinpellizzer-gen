    "intro": "Scirpus parvulus, commonly known as the small bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length, and it produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to the plant's ability to stabilize soil in aquatic habitats. Scirpus parvulus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms."
