    "intro": "Simsia rhombifolia, commonly known as the diamond-leaved sunflower, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive rhombic-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that resemble those of the sunflower. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Simsia rhombifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant appearance."
