    "intro": "Swainsona stenodonta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved swainsona, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Swainsona stenodonta is adapted to survive in low-water conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
