    "intro": "Sphaeropteris pukuana, commonly known as the Pukana cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the island of Tonga in the South Pacific. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnate leaves that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones being ovoid, typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
