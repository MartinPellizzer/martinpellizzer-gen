It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which give it its common name, and its clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Sageretia cordiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and delicate blooms."
