    "intro": "Salix athabascensis, commonly known as the Alaska willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the subarctic and arctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and its ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Salix athabascensis is also valued for its resilience and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
