    "intro": "Selago saxatilis, commonly known as the rock selago, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late summer. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it is well adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Selago saxatilis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
