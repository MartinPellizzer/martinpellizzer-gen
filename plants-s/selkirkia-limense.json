    "intro": "Selkirkia limense, commonly known as the Selkirk's lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found growing on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate and subtropical regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for air quality and ecological health."
