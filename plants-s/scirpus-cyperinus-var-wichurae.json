    "intro": "Scirpus cyperinus var. wichurae, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a variant of the bulrush genus native to wetland habitats. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and provides habitat for aquatic organisms."
