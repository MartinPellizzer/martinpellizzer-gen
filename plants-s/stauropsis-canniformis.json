    "intro": "Stauropsis canniformis, commonly known as the giant marsh fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant typically grows in wet, swampy areas and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The fronds are usually evergreen, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, glossy appearance."
