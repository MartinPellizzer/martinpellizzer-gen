    "intro": "Sporobolus arenicola, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and hairless, with a bluish-green hue, and it flowers from late spring to early summer. Sporobolus arenicola plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitats."
