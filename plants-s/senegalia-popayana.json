    "intro": "Senegalia popayana, commonly known as the Popay\u00e1n acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the dry regions of South America, particularly in Colombia and Venezuela. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically reduced to spines, and its yellow, globular flower heads that appear in clusters. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife. Additionally, it has been used traditionally for its wood and as a source of fodder for livestock."
