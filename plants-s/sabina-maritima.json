    "intro": "Sabina maritima, commonly known as the maritime juniper, is a small evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and small, blue-gray berries. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salty, windy environments. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Sabina maritima is also valued for its aromatic wood and historical use in traditional medicine."
