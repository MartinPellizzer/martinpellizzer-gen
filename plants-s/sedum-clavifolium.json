    "intro": "Sedum clavifolium, commonly known as the clustered stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Sedum clavifolium is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in harsh alpine environments."
