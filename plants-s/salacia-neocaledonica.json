    "intro": "Salacia neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonia salacia, is a flowering plant native to the island of New Caledonia in the South Pacific. It belongs to the Salaciacae family and is characterized by its woody stems and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the tropical rainforests of the region. Its leaves are usually elliptical and glossy, while its flowers are often clustered in inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Salacia neocaledonica is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
