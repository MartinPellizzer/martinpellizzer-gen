    "intro": "Sclerolobium rubiginosum, commonly known as the red-stained acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its greyish-brown, fissured bark and compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, pale seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. The plant has been used traditionally for its wood and in some cultural practices."
