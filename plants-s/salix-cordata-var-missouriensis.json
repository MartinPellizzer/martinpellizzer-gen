    "intro": "Salix cordata var. missouriensis, commonly known as the Missouri dogwood willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the central United States. It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a fuzzy texture. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. It thrives in moist soils and is often found along streambanks and wetlands. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for ecological landscaping and wildlife habitat restoration."
