    "intro": "Salix triandra var. quadrivalvis, commonly known as the four-valved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often peeling in thin layers. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
