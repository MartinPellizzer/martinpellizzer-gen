    "intro": "Stevia martinii, commonly known as the sweetleaf plant, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in dense inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Stevia martinii is valued not only for its sweet taste but also for its use in traditional medicine and as a sugar substitute in modern health-conscious diets."
