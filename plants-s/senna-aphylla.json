    "intro": "Senna aphylla, commonly known as the leafless senna, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with only small, scale-like structures present instead. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open when mature to release the seeds. Senna aphylla is adapted to survive in harsh environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
