    "intro": "Selaginella brackenridgei, commonly known as the Mexican clubmoss, is a rare and endangered vascular plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures called strobila. This plant is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded, humid environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important subject in botanical research and conservation efforts."
