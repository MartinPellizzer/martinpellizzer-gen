    "intro": "Salomonia parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a flowering plant that belongs to the Convolvulaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to the roots of host plants. Salomonia parasitica is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing on various woody plants as a partial parasite."
