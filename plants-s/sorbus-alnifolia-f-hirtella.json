    "intro": "Sorbus alnifolia f. hirtella, commonly known as the hairy alnus sorbus, is a variant of the alnifolia species within the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy or pubescent leaves, which distinguish it from other forms of Sorbus alnifolia. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often in mountainous regions. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers in spring, followed by clusters of small, red berries in the fall. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
