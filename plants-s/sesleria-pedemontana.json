    "intro": "Sesleria pedemontana, commonly known as the Alpine feather grass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features fine, silver-gray foliage with a dense, tufted growth habit, making it visually striking in alpine gardens. The plant produces delicate, feathery inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements."
