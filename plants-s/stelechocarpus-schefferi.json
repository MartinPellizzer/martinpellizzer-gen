    "intro": "Stelechocarpus schefferi, commonly known as the giant pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its large, fibrous roots and robust, branching stems. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, spiky fruits. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Stelechocarpus schefferi is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional crafts due to its strong, fibrous leaves."
