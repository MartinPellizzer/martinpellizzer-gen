    "intro": "Salix purpurea var. longipetiolata, commonly known as the purple willow with long petioles, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and distinctive purple-tinged leaves that are often elongated with long petioles. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are male and female flowers arranged in separate clusters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and have a serrated margin. This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland edges."
