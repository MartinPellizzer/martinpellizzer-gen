    "intro": "Saussurea tanakae var. phyllolepis, commonly known as the leafy saussurea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers in late summer. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils at high altitudes, and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
