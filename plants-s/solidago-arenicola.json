    "intro": "Solidago arenicola, commonly known as sandplain goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, particularly in open, disturbed areas such as dunes and roadsides. The plant produces showy, yellow inflorescences in late summer and early autumn, which attract a variety of pollinators. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Sandplain goldenrod plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
