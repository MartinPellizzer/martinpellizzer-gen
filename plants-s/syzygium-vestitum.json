    "intro": "Syzygium vestitum, commonly known as the rough-skin tamarind, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, lemon-yellow fruits with a tart flavor. Syzygium vestitum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the use of its fruits in traditional cuisine and medicine. Its growth habit makes it suitable for hedges and small garden spaces."
