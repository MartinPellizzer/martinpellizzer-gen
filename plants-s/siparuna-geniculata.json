It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Siparuna geniculata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm climates."
