    "intro": "Schepperia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often translucent leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ethereal appearance. Schepperia thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
