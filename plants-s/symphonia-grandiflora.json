    "intro": "Symphonia grandiflora, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a tropical tree native to central and eastern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant has a thick, woody trunk with a rough, fissured bark that provides protection against pests and environmental stress. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, often with a glossy surface and a strong, aromatic scent. Symphonia grandiflora is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in construction and furniture-making."
