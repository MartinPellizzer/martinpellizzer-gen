    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos aquatilis, commonly known as the aquatic star-stephanos, is a rare aquatic plant characterized by its unique, spherical inflorescence. It thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving streams and ponds with nutrient-rich substrates. The plant's leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, adapted for efficient light absorption in water. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are small and clustered, often floating on the water's surface. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
