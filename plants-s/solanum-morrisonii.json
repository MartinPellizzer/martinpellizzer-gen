    "intro": "Solanum morrisonii, commonly known as the Morrison's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 1 meter, featuring hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, which bloom in the evening. Its berries are toxic and contain alkaloids, making it a plant with both ecological and potential medicinal significance. Solanum morrisonii is often found in moist, shaded environments within its native habitat."
