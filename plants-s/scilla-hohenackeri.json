    "intro": "Scilla hohenackeri, commonly known as the Hohenacker squill, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in cooler, moist environments. It is a perennial herb that blooms in early spring, adding a delicate touch of color to alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
