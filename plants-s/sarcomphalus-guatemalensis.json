    "intro": "Sarcomphalus guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan milkweed, is a perennial herb native to Central America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. Its milky sap, which is characteristic of the Asclepiadaceae family, is a notable botanical feature. Sarcomphalus guatemalensis is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories."
