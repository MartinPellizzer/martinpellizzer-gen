    "intro": "Sparganium manshuricum, commonly known as the Far Eastern bur-reed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Typhaceae. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly Russia and China, and typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant features tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces distinctive, spiky flower heads that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its flowers are monoecious, meaning both male and female flowers are present on the same plant, and it relies on wind pollination. Sparganium manshuricum plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food and shelter for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
