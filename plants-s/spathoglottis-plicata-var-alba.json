It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its broad, fleshy leaves and showy, white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The flowers are often clustered in inflorescences and are pollinated by insects."
