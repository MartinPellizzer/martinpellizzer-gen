    "intro": "Samolus valerandi var. typicus, commonly known as the lesser water-plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and colonize new areas. Samolus valerandi var. typicus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
