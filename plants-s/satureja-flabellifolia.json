    "intro": "Satureja flabellifolia, commonly known as the fan-leaved savory, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, aromatic leaves with a distinctive fan-like shape, which gives it its common name. The plant produces tiny, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often used in cooking for its pungent, slightly minty flavor. Satureja flabellifolia thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and herbal collections."
