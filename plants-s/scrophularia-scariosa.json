It is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are erect and often reddish in color. Scrophularia scariosa is known for its rapid growth and short blooming period, making it a common sight in temperate regions."
