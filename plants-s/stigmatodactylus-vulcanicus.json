    "intro": "Stigmatodactylus vulcanicus, commonly known as the volcanic orchid, is a rare and unique plant species native to the volcanic regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet and yellow floral structures, which are adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, high-temperature environments. The plant's roots have a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, allowing it to absorb essential minerals from the rocky soil. Its flowering period coincides with the cooler nights following volcanic eruptions, a phenomenon linked to its sensitivity to environmental changes. Due to habitat destruction, Stigmatodactylus vulcanicus is considered endangered and is the subject of ongoing conservation efforts."
