    "intro": "Smilax latipes, commonly known as the southern arrowwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features woody stems that are often armed with sharp spines, which help protect it from herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that are edible for some bird species. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a distinctive waxy coating. Smilax latipes is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade."
