It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces showy yellow flowers during the summer months, adding visual interest to its appearance. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It is relatively easy to care for, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil."
