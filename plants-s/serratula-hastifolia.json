    "intro": "Serratula hastifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sow-thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and has a rosette of narrow, serrated leaves. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in the summer, followed by the development of achene fruits. Serratula hastifolia is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
