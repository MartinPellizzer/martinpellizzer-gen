It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their bright color and nectar-rich structure.
