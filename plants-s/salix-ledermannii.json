    "intro": "Salix ledermannii, commonly known as Ledermann's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine habitats. The plant has slender, flexible branches and produces catkin-like flowers in early spring. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a silvery underside. Salix ledermannii is adapted to harsh climates and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid and semi-arid regions."
