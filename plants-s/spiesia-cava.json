    "intro": "Spiesia cava, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and produces yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in late spring. Its scientific name reflects its classification within the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers. Spiesia cava is adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a hardy species found in desert and chaparral habitats."
