    "intro": "Saxifraga kumlienii, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, often at high elevations where conditions are harsh. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pink, with five petals, and blooms in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs that help protect it from cold and desiccation. Saxifraga kumlienii is well adapted to its extreme environment, showcasing remarkable resilience and survival strategies."
