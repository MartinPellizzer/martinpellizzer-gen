It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are clustered in dense, cylindrical structures. Sporobolus ejuncidus is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
