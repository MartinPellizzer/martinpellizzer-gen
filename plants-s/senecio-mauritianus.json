    "intro": "Senecio mauritianus, commonly known as the Mauritius groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the island of Mauritius. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has a low, spreading habit with narrow, silvery-green leaves. Its yellow flowers bloom in clusters and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
