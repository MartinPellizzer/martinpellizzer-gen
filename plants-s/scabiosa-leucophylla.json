    "intro": "Scabiosa leucophylla, commonly known as the white scabious, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces numerous slender, thread-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and wildflower meadows. Its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees add to its ecological and ornamental value."
