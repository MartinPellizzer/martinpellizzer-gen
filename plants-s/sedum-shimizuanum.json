It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
