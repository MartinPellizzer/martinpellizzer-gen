    "intro": "Saxifraga cherlerioides subsp. stelleriana, commonly known as the Steller's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with dark green, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
