    "intro": "Salsola loeselii, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Salsola loeselii is well adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for desert wildlife."
