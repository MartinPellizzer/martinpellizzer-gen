    "intro": "Sticherus bradeorum, commonly known as the Brade's sticherus, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Restionaceae, which includes plants adapted to nutrient-poor soils and arid environments. The plant typically grows in coastal or rocky habitats, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters, and are pollinated by wind or insects."
