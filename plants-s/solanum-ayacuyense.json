    "intro": "Solanum ayacuyense, commonly known as the Ayacucho nightshade, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers. Its leaves are usually ovate with a hairy texture, and it produces small, yellowish fruits that ripen to a dark purple. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Solanum genus."
