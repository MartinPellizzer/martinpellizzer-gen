    "intro": "Stelis cordibractea, commonly known as the heart-leaf orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features elongated, strap-like leaves that are often folded, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a unique structure that includes a spurred lip. Stelis cordibractea thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
