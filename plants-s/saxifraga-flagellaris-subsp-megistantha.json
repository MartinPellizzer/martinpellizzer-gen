    "intro": "Saxifraga flagellaris subsp. megistantha, commonly known as the giant saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to retain moisture in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in a raceme, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive species, making it a subject of interest in botanical research and conservation efforts."
