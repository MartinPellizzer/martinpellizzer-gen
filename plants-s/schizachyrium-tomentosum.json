    "intro": "Schizachyrium tomentosum, commonly known as hairy grama, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-based flowers. Hairy grama is often used in native plant landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
