    "intro": "Sorghastrum incompletum var. incompletum, commonly known as the tallgrass bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often pink to purple in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, making it a valuable component of native grassland ecosystems. It is also known for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in various environmental conditions."
