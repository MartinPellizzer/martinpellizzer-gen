    "intro": "Solidago valesiaca, commonly known as the alpine goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its upright stem and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh conditions of its habitat. Solidago valesiaca plays an important role in pollination and is a symbol of resilience in high-altitude ecosystems."
