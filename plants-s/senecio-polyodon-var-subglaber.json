It is a perennial shrub characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and hairless. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid regions."
