    "intro": "Schefflera duidae, commonly known as the Duidae schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features a distinctive umbrella-like arrangement of leaves, with multiple leaflets radiating from a central point. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden areas. Its adaptability and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor landscaping."
