    "intro": "Schizorhiza neglecta, commonly known as the neglected schizorhiza, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical forests. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a short, upright stem. Due to habitat loss and limited study, Schizorhiza neglecta remains poorly understood in the botanical community."
