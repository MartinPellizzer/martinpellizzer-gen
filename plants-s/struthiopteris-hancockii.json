    "intro": "Struthiopteris hancockii, commonly known as Hancock's sword fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its long, arching fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and wiry, supporting the growth of its delicate, bipinnate leaves. Hancock's sword fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
