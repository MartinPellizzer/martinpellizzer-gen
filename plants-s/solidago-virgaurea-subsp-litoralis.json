    "intro": "Solidago virgaurea subsp. litoralis, commonly known as seaside goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in harsh environments. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting biodiversity in maritime habitats."
