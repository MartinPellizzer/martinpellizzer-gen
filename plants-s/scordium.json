    "intro": "Scordium, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a single, upright stem that terminates in a flower head. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow and arranged in a composite head. Scordium species are often found in dry, sandy soils and are native to regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
