    "intro": "Scabiosa tschiliensis f. alpina, commonly known as the alpine scabious, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, clustered flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a basal rosette, aiding in water retention and frost resistance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it suitable for alpine gardens and rockeries. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
