    "intro": "Stelis tetramera, commonly known as the four-lobed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it forms dense clusters of foliage. The plant produces strikingly beautiful flowers with four petals and a distinctive lip, which are often brightly colored. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil. Stelis tetramera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden environments."
