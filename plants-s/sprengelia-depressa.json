    "intro": "Sprengelia depressa, commonly known as the dwarf spurge, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its stems are often reddish or purplish, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. Sprengelia depressa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
