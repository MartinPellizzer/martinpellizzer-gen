    "intro": "Sarracenia flava var. atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple-flowered trumpet pitcher plant, is a variant of the yellow pitcher plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking red to purple floral bracts and elongated, tubular leaves that form deep, pitcher-shaped traps. The plant's foliage is typically green with a reddish hue, and the pitchers are often adorned with a dark purple or black rim. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. The plant's unique morphology and striking coloration make it a popular choice for carnivorous plant enthusiasts."
