    "intro": "Scrophularia aquatica var. umbrosa, commonly known as water figwort, is a variant of the water figwort species native to wetland and marshy habitats. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found along the edges of ponds, streams, and wet meadows. Due to its preference for aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, it plays a role in supporting local insect populations and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
