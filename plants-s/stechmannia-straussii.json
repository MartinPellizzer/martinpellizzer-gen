    "intro": "Stechmannia straussii, commonly known as the Strauss's stechmannia, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its unique floral structure. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which attract specific pollinators. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy texture, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
