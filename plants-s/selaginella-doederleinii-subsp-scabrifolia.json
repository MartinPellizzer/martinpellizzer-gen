    "intro": "Selaginella doederleinii subsp. scabrifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss found in arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its elongated, needle-like leaves that are rough to the touch, giving it its subspecies name. This plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which is a key feature of its reproductive biology. Selaginella doederleinii subsp. scabrifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme environments."
