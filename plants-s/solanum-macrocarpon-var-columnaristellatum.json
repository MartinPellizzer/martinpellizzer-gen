    "intro": "Solanum macrocarpon var. columnaristellatum, commonly known as the columnar eggplant, is a unique variant of the eggplant species characterized by its upright, tree-like growth habit. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and peppers. The plant typically produces elongated, egg-shaped fruits that are often harvested before they fully ripen. Its columnar structure makes it a popular choice for small spaces due to its compact form. Botanically, it exhibits distinct genetic traits that contribute to its vertical growth pattern and fruit morphology."
