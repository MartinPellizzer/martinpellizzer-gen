It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
