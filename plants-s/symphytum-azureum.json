    "intro": "Symphytum azureum, commonly known as Azure Comfrey, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water and nutrients. Azure Comfrey is often found in moist, shaded environments like woodlands and stream banks."
