    "intro": "Selaginella cuspidata var. elongata, commonly known as the long-needle spikemoss, is a vascular fern ally native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its intricate, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including drought, due to its specialized water-storing structures. Its reproductive structures, called microsporangia and megasporangia, are located on specialized leaves called microphylls. This species plays an important ecological role in moist, shaded habitats by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various organisms."
