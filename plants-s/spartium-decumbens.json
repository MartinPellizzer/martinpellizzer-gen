    "intro": "Spartium decumbens, commonly known as creeping spurge or redroot, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its prostrate or decumbent stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating. Spartium decumbens is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats."
