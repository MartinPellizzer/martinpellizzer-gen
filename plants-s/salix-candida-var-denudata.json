    "intro": "Salix candida var. denudata, commonly known as the white willow with bare branches, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and small, ovate leaves that are typically white or pale green on the upper surface. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
